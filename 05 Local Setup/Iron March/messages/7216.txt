<p>page 102, there is greek text before the "Propitiation Formula"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>also on page 109 there is a correspondence of greek to latin letters used by one translator, you can see in the pages in between a number of capslock'd words that look like gibberish, could you pick out a few and decode them back to greek according to the correspondences and say if it's also complete gibberish in greek? matter of fact is that they should remain gibberish.</p>
