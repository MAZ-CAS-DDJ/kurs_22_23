	It would, but we'd be #2. Bear in mind, we were the last settled part of the Lower 48 and basically ignored in pop culture until the '90s. We have a pretty strong sense of common values (love of nature/salmon/high tolerance for eccentricity/a reserved nature...) and tend to be very insular, not caring much about the rest of the world unless it affects us.<br /><br />
	The only issue with many Cascadian independence ideas is they include Vancouver. BC and the American Northwest are growing increasingly distinct, as BC becomes a place where Canadians move for the less-freezing weather. "Canada's California." Meanwhile, the military investment in the Tacoma area is Americanizing Washington to the point that it also doesn't feel "kind of in-between the US and Canada" anymore, and Oregon has never identified with the Vancouver area in any way. The national boundary was even originally going to be at the Columbia River, the modern dividing line between Oregon and Washington, before President Polk out-negotiated you. ;)
