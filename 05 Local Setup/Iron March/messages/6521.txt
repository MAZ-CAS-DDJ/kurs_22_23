<p>I think the military guys are more level-headed about everything to be honest. I would still argue we need a strong financial base to be successful, as the impending collapse everyone is discussing will not necessarily leave major power centers incapable of squashing any emerging nationalist resistance. Both GLR and WLP were pretty well-established and educated before they embarked on their crusades, and I would argue that contributed heavily to the (reasonable) victories they were met with.</p>

<p>My point about Alex is that he can be rather impulsive in obliterating anyone who does not share his perfect understanding of fascism and the world. At least Italian Fascism was a catch-all movement in the early years, and Mussolini did not run about calling every left-winger or capitalist conservative in the movement "autist!" or the like. Even assuming the fantastical white refuge is created in the Pacific Northwest, you're not going to have a group of automatons accepting fascism unconditionally just because. Some compromise will be needed to save whatever remnants of a nation we still possess, so leaders should be slightly more accomodating. </p>
