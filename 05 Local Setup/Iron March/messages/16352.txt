	Hey Xav, just wanted to see how you were doing. I also wanted to make a correction from last time. These pictures are what my hair usually looks like. I realized that in the last pics I sent you the gel had melted lol. Though my sides have grown a bit in these new pics and you can kind of tell that my hair has been slicked back idk kind of a low quality pic took using my phone so do me a favor and let you know if you can tell that my hair is slicked back. Have to use cheap gel so I have to use a lot lol. Sorry, I didn't make the correction earlier or contact you earlier. I have been extremely busy here lately as I get deeper into the semester.
