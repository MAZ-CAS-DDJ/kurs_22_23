<p>G'day M8, I were going to hit you up at the time but you were taking a break and I didn't want to bother you for any work.If you could improve upon those designs(imagery, wording &amp; aesthetic included) , as you have for the Canadians, I got the idea for the layout from those and thought I could half replicate it on pic collage haha, that'd be awesome.</p>
<p>I ceased on printing anymore as it's not to the quality I would like, especially if IM's name is going to be on it, so whatever you could do would be much appreciated and obviously imbursed generously for your time, would be great having a few posters to start things off for IM in OZ. </p>
<p>I'd like to use the celtic cross to some extent, for a nod toward the ANM and Jack, even if you could do a simple ANM mock up of it with the Stars of the Southern Cross on the four points, that'd be awesome. I used it instead of the IM symbol as I couldn't find a graphic for it that can be super-imposed over an image, what is that called in technical terms? Would be awesome to learn how to do that, anyway cheers m8, let us know if you need any further details.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
