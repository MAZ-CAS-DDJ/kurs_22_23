	Thanks for the last comment to my introduction, it was epic. :D
</p>

<p>
	I have a video and two questions for you. First the video:

</p>

<p>
	And the questions:
</p>

<p>
	1. What is your opinion on the video?
</p>

<p>
	2. Do you have Traditionalist groups in Romania? Hungary was almost completely inactive before 1945, while Romania was full with Traditionalist authors, but for me it looks like this tendency was reversed for the XXI. century. I don't know if you have any of them today, but I have read a book which was a collection of various studies by Romanian authors from the XX. century and it was a fucking great reading, mainly about the Legion and it's Captain of course. <a href="https://moly.hu/system/covers/big/covers_117878.jpg" rel="external nofollow">Here you can check the list of authors on the cover.</a>
