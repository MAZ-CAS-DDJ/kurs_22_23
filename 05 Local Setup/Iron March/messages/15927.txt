	Maybe slavros can come on or something. Cantwell's been talking about getting more guests on for the first hour of the show and I think now would be a good time to speak on behalf of the Iron March, taking the iron pill  <span style="color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.8px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;float:none;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">christopher.cantwell@gmail.com</span>

	I love Natt's calls, and he's probably everyone's favorite caller by popular demand. Natt is like a big brother trying to push everyone further to the right. His rhetoric about the condition of man and natural order is really gripping, and I can already hear some of it in Cantwell's rants about how the Left hates Life itself. We don't get to hear enough of those messages tho, and there's too much emphasis on daily "politics"
