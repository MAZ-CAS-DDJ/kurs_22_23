<p>I didn't really get that impression from the American nationalists here. American_Blackshirt, in <em>Reaktion</em>, explicitly defines pretty much everyone currently in the US, Anglo or Continental, white or black, as American, except for illegal Hispanic immigrants. Yes, I suppose this is Civic Nationalism, but were I an American I'd rather take the option that turned the US into an autonomous isolationist state by reviving the things that made it great than the one that turned it into a colony again. (However, both options are sufficiently far away from the current American mindset that I can't see either being realised in the near future.) I'm watching your debate with Kacen with great interest.</p>
<p>As a Canadian, certainly my nation has its origins in "Anglo-Saxondom", being a part of the Commonwealth, and I think that's a key part of what Canada is as a nation, though it will develop if given a chance into something more, I hope.</p>
<p>I've also sent an email regarding <em>Foundations</em> to the website of the Eurasian Movement; hoping to receive a response in intelligible English soon.</p>
