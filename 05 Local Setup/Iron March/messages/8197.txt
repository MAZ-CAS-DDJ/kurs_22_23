<p>Hey mate this is just a quick reply before bed, cause I felt kind of rude for posting on the forums while ignoring your message. Yep, Jim is radnat... and if you read SF Downunder and see my posts (I post as 'Grimalkin'), excuse the spergyish way I write there, I do it specifically to cater for SF members a lot of whom are either paranoid, thick as pigshit, or ready to jump at the chance to be offended by something. Kind of why I don't post on SF a lot. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_dry.png" alt="&lt;_&lt;" /></p>

<p>Sucks about your Aussie Day mate, but I bet you made a fair bit of coin so it'd be worth it- sorry for rubbing mine in your face, had no idea you'd be working your arse off! Anyhow, I'm gonna go, but- I might address some of the points in your PM in the Aussie subforum, now that it exists. Really want to get some use out of it so Slavros doesn't shit all over it. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
