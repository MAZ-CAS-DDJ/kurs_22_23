	My friend, my life was bound for this. After Westpoint I'm planning on heading to California to study at Stanford for 4 years. From there I will be old enough to apply to become an officer in the SEALs. The SEAL base is located in Coronado right below San Diego. If you would like to branch out across America into the West Coast, San Diego would be your best bet. Despite California's degenerate leanings, San Diego is a very Catholic, clean city, and San Diego county is relatively right leaning compared to the rest of the state. There should also a Polish minority there with plenty of resources-both military and civil-about the area. Also SoCal has a fascist history, with one of The Silver Legion's HQs in LA. After military service with the SEALs I will certainly join your Paramilitary faction.
