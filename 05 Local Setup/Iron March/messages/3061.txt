<p>If truth be told, we are both somewhat alienated on this site in terms of our true opinions. </p>
<p>Fascism has always been about strong charismatic leaders as much as any set ideology. Charismatic people who have messages of economic or social independence, can mold the "rules" to their nation. </p>
<p>Christianity still has an appeal for charismatic leaders because it is a contradiction, like many other religions. It gives conviction if you talk about God, and people like you. People like moral men because they seem like savior figures. Like Moses or Jesus. And Christianity is the first unified European basis of morality and code of ethics. Fascists who disregard morality as a "modern" construct will fail in populist appeal. </p>
<p>Simultaneously, Christianity has the power to be an identity that has nothing to do with worship in God or being a disciple of Jesus or his morality. I guarantee many of the people who talk about being Christian do not pray to God regularly or do as Christ would do. </p>
<p>However, they like the accomplishments of people that did live their life with this conviction. So in a sense, it is parasitic. </p>
<p>At this point, religion can not die out because it appeals to human hope and something people need to believe in when life becomes terrible. Religion is an idea that is stronger than the state. Christianity is also a powerful idea. So that's why one would support it. An organized religion is a nation of itself, and to counter a nation that could convert your people to its message, it must be accepted and controlled. Although, this is a problem because then it is empty and is less spiritual.</p>
<p>It is fairly genius. Religion is a complexity that nobody knows how to deal with. If you control it and sanction it, the lack of spirituality will eventually lead to civil instability from people believing in the message.</p>
