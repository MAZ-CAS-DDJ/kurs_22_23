	No I don't practice chaos magick. "Witchcraft" is simply about using the powers of the mind and/or soul. There are atheist, agnostic, abrahamic, hindu, pagan, satanist, irreligious, etc. Witches. Divination, Energy work, spiritual work, astral work, herbalism, oils, crystals, etc. all fall under "Witchcraft". I specifically practice divination, energy work and spiritual work. To go deeper I do tarot, stitchomancy, scrying, shufflemancy, Astrology, etc. I work on my soul and chakras (energy work), I work with Demons, deceased human spirits and plants &amp; trees (spirit work), I go inside planets and stars and use their energy to empower my soul and chakras or change me, for example using Uranus to become more intelligent and creative. I also study and practice black magic, tantra, voodoo/voudon and seid. Black magic I only use for defense and justice. For example I'm going to fucking curse and rip apart the energy of the person who shot my nephew 5-7 times and killed him. <br />
	I specialize in love and sex magick. This is one of my main and core practices. I'm also a healer as I'm a massage therapist.
