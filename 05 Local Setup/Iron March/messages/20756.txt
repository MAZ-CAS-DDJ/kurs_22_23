	I'll be honest I don't know much about esotericism and the occult. I have a friend who used to be into that stuff specifically demons. He said he has interacted with them before but I think it was around the time his schizophrenia onset. (I think his drug use triggered latent schizophrenia). What type of results do you get with your practices? All you mentioned was becoming more intelligent and creative but what are the effects of your practices?

			I also study and practice black magic, tantra, voodoo/voudon and seid. Black magic I only use for defense and justice. For example I'm going to fucking curse and rip apart the energy of the person who shot my nephew 5-7 times and killed him.

	Wow, do you know who killed him? I think lead would be a more direct way of getting back at him.
