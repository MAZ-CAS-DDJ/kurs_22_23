	Identity Evropa and American Vanguard were started as groups for college-students, and both are active in OC and LA for sure. Atomwaffen should be open to people under 18 as well, but I don't think they have anyone out, here, that being said I may be wrong. I don't know if the TWP is too big around here, NSM has a bit of activity in the Inland Empire area, but they might not be open to someone under 18.
