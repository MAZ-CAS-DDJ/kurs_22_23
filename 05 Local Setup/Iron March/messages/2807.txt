<p>You seem to be really bothered by all of this. Especially the part where you used the pejorative Red Fascism to describe the anti-Fascist Socialism In One Country theory. I'm sure Stalinism's a very efficient mode of 'Fascism' <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> ;) <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" />, what with the bare, bare-minimum being done for the peasants and the surplus of the USSR's resources being shipped off to feed Moscow.</p>
<p>Being a Muscovite, you treat Stalin like a Muslim treats Muhammad.</p>
<p>Let me know how your metanationalism works out. I'm sure the international academia will welcome you with open arms.</p>
<p>On another note, I don't exactly understand where all of your aggression comes from, but you don't really seem like a person that's very comfortable in your own skin. Don't give me that bullshit about how this is how a Fascist is supposed to behave like. You clearly have some sort of personality disorder. Get that shit fixed, otherwise you're going to be a miserable nervous wreck by the time you're middle-aged.</p>
<p>Of course, you reside in Moscow, a place composed mostly of people who communicate generally through anger and obscenities than in a more sophisticated fashion of understanding and proper etiquette. Growing up in a place like that would definitely corrode the central nervous system. Oh, and it's evident that your distinct Middle-Eastern appearance must have really shaped your personality, having been picked on by the native Russians enough.</p>
<p>Now, instead of being primitive and low-class about it, how about you change my user title to something more dignifying?</p>
<p>I want the title of "Social Corporatist".</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
