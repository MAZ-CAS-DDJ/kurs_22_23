<p>Alright well sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to get back into university soon. As for the comic I probably will buy it because I got a gift card for the holidays that I need to use up so its not like buying it will set me back. Also, remember that sword, hammer, and shield pin I have? Well, it looks like the Arditi website may have gotten some more in, though I would e-mail the guy(just click the contact button on the site) to make sure. He is pretty good at responding to e-mails. Looks like he is based in Portugal and I have dealt with him both on the Arditi site and ebay, and I have always gotten what I ordered. Anyways if you are interested here is the link and a better pic of what it looks like. (from the site)</p>
