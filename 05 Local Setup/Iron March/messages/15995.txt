	Dear Friend,<br /><br />
	Yes, I saw that post too. Just a correction, he said dislikes Christianity and is into some form of occult, so I think that is just for username sakes and not really Catholic.<br /><br />
	Indeed, it makes me very mad too. To answer your question,

	This is just a general advice, questions like these (which is the correct path of action) are things you should ask God about. If you ask this to God and he tells through your conscience that you should/shouldn't to do something, then do it/don't do it. <br /><br />
	But since you asked, my personal advice is that the term judge is very broad, it is good that you judge his actions and telling him that he is wrong and that he should stop, <em>but</em> it is not good to judge him like I did (I judged in a very arrogant and sinful way, so I did wrong). But I think EvilCatholicNaziGoy doesn't want to change from his degeneracy because he likes his degeneracy, so I personally think it would be a waste of time trying. But if you don't think so, make your own decision, just make sure it is a correct God-based decision.

	I agree. Such degeneracy supporting should not be allowed on a forum of quality.
