<p>I saw that first hand when I visited SUNY New Paltz campus, pillow biters with butterfly tattoos on their necks fucking disgusting. I just laugh about it now more than getting angry, I mean I still get angry but I can control it a lot better than I could when I was younger you know? Just comes with maturity and greater and better things I guess. </p>
