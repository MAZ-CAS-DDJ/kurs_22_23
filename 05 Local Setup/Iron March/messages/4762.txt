<p>Hmm I do not have great knowledge of schools in NY, but here are some suggestions in the general area you mentioned:</p>
<p>Norwich University (in Vermont but it's a military university with ROTC/NROTC and has military history/strategic studies majors). Well-respected in the military as far as I have heard.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong></p>
<p>Penn State </p>
<p>Temple University</p>
<p>UPIttsburgh</p>
<p><strong>WV:</strong></p>
<p>WVU (fairly conservative but it is overall a party school. Only has Army ROTC).</p>
<p><strong>MD:</strong></p>
<p>UMD - College Park (Great ROTC program and is basically a public Ivy)</p>
<p>Towson University</p>
<p><strong>D.C.: (Keep in mind these ones are extremely expensive without an ROTC scholarship, which is not guaranteed)</strong></p>
<p>American University</p>
<p>Catholic University</p>
<p>VA:</p>
<p>GMU (only Army ROTC but fairly conservative campus with decent international politics programs/distinguished teachers)</p>
<p>UVA (has all ROTC units but extremely left-wing culture).</p>
<p>Virginia Tech (this one is an outlier for the range you noted, but probably the best cadet program on the eastern seaboard apart from Annapolis).</p>
<p>VMI (some of my friends go here; excellent military school).</p>
<p>Can't say I know much about Delaware apart from the U of, which I've not heard much good/bad about. Just remember that if you take ROTC your military science courses are going to include military history, and you can place them in tandem with a history major/minor. </p>
<p>As far as the practical skills aspect, I don't know of most schools offering them in ROTC programs. Usually you have to enlist to get that sort of training, or take classes at a vocational school. The most practical majors are generally considered to be finance/accounting or anything in engineering. In my case I chose neither, so time will tell if I get a job.</p>
