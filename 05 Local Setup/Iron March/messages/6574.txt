<p>I genuinely am trying to understand your position, partly because I think I may have confused you and others as to my own. I am an 'Old Believer' sympathizer as I said in reply to you on my 'general introduction' thread, and am of the opinion that Russia (Moscovy) has lost it's soul since the Old Believer Schism and Peter the Great with his Modernism. For me, 'Third Rome/Holy Rus' is something to aspire to spiritually in the political Orthodox tradition begun by st. Constantine, not the Imperialist geopolitics of today. I want a Great Power out there to oppose the Jews however, so it's a temptation for me as for others in the West to see that in the false 'Russia' of today. </p>
<p>On another but related note, i'm interested in the Aryanism you espouse and it's opposition to WN/WS, and would like to know more. God Bless you and yours, 'michaelarchangel' </p>
