<p>Good to see that we are on the same line after all. The few details we disagree on are really not all that important, our general outlook is the same.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks a lot and may God bless you and the true Russia too!</p>

<p>You're welcome Svitanok,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will say this though, from what i've seen this forum is pretty sad and hateful, with a few exceptions, but somewhat better intellectually than other forums i've been on. If I remain active here, it will be from Aryan and Orthodox Compassion. Nonetheless, are there other forums you are on? I used to be on stormfront myself, with pretty much the same experiences as on here. Well, God Bless Ukraine and you and all your folk!</p>

<p>I am not on any other forum at the moment. I definitely agree that IM is pretty sad and hateful right now. The quality of the board is really fluctuating. When I signed up, it was full of NazBols and pro-Zionist dopes, then it improved, now it is on a low again with all this Stormfront-esque WN bullshit. I never liked Stormfront and never had an account there. I read a couple of threads one time and decided it was a madhouse.</p>

<p>Hello Svitanok,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I primarily post these days a little on the 'politicsforum.org' forum, lately I haven't been posting much anywhere to speak of.I'm engaged in more reading and research and reflection before I post much more anywhere. I hope Ukraine and Russia don't come to blows soon, because as you know that primarily serves the interests of the Elders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, take care,</p>
<p> </p>
