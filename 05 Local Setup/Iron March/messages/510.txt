<p>There is alot of cynicism you get from books like femanine fascism, and cultural visions of the far right in england - that imply women were somehow used. You kind of have to understand women's politics at the time. </p>
<p>Women were primarily involved in politics to be Pro-family - that was their ambition that was what the major womans organisations were there for - support and social responsibility to the family unit. It may suprise you but most leftist intellectuals (who campaigned for abortion and workplace equality) were against women having the vote or being involved in politics at all because of their social conservatism. This was the reason alcahol was banned in the US - because it was destroying homes. Sylvia pankhurst types were lunatic fringe communists - most became involved in fascism instead.</p>
<p>With that in mind it is intuitive that Mosley didn't think they were Stupid or generally less able but the priority of the economy and the society was around the family unit. this is what mosley meant when he said that women were not going to be chased out of the workplace, but were not going to be chased in there either. I don't think he was opposed to women going to university and getting jobs on principle.</p>
<p>As someone who served in the trenches he was probably against women taking active service - not because they were not up to it, but because no real man could have it on his conscience.</p>
