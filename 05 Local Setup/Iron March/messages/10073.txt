<p>My biggest concern in writing this, and the reason I am writing it towards a perspective that knows no such thing as fascism, is to truly redpill an otherwise neutral or apathetic person. Perhaps a conservative, perhaps a liberal, but one with no nationalist allegiance or association.<br /><br />For this to work effectively, nobody with nationalist associations can discover and spread it. It is and will be to what Paul was to Christianity, the Manifest to the cause of fascism.<br /><br />This does not mean of course, that fascists will not take part in this. Because they will, but they cannot be the starting movement. It must be non-fascists that discover the manifest for themselves and from there start the movement.Â <br /><br />This is to ensure the movement is fresh and thus has the best chance of succeeding.</p>
