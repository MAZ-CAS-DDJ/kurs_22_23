<p>Yep, you hit the nail right on the head with your observations about white nationalism. It is zionist to the bone. Imitating this degenerate talmudic yankee invented crap is a bad idea for any real nationalist, be he European, Asian or whatever else. Regarding religion, I think adding a crescent is far better than removing the cross. Nationalism needs to promote religion and spirituality to counter the destructive materialism of our modern world. Besides this, Christians (at least Catholics and Orthodox; most Protestants seem highly corrupted and judaized) and Muslims share the same god, similar values and ideals and above all the same enemy - the Jew. Christian-Islamic cooperation is definitely needed.</p>
<p>Marcos seems like a decent guy. I'm not surprised that the German National Socialists respected Filipinos, they were generally friendly to the Asians. The real National Socialists weren't white supremacists or similar minded retards. The real racists in WW2 were the Allies. This is why it sickens me when daviddukeoid stormfrontoid WNoid pieces of shit use Third Reich-imagery to promote their bullshit. Adolf Hitler was an admirable man of prime nobility, the Swastika is a sacred symbol of life and light - how can you defame them by connecting them to something as despicable as white zionism? The Third Reich wasn't perfect of course, far from it, but it was built on the right principles.</p>
<p>The background music of the Frente Nasyonal-video is pretty cool by the way. Is it traditional Filipino music? It reminds me a bit of Javanese gamelan, just more rhythmic and militaristic sounding.</p>

<p>1. I agree 100%, it isn't the Muslim in Europe who is the problem (though he should still go back to his homeland, like my mother said "It's better to be in your country"), but rather, the kike. To remove the kike, remove the ways of the kike, like zionism. In my case, it's removing the yankee-kike influences. Regarding Christianity and Islam, i do agree with what you've said. Not just that, I believe Shia Islam and Sunni Islam should set their differences and fight the Salafi/wahhabi fags, which is kike-based Islam, corrupted Islam, promoted by a zionist government (Saudi Arabia), though i am not a Muslim to comment on this. </p>
<p>2. Good, you know the truth about Marcos. I hate to say this, but a lot of Iron March people believe in zionist propaganda, that NS is a racist thing. (although in the case of Rockwell, he could have only used "race separation" for numerical reasons against zionist domination in yankyland, although i do think most yanks, especially proddies, are soaked to the bone with zionism.). I do think that the WNfags are too much embedded in <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">kike</span> hollywood propaganda "yeah nazis were bad hurr durr, dey kill jooz, we be nazis and kill dem blacks". </p>
<p>3. I don't know if it's really our traditional music (because they almost sound the same), but we have a gamelan-like instrument. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulintang" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulintang</a> </p>
<p>As for our traditional music, Unfortunately, most of our music isn't even traditional, i don't even hear a musical piece with a traditional musical piece, i don't hear people say "Hey, there's a new music piece with Philippine traditional music instruments", just gangnam style based trash or trashy music like "charice". It's typical western trash, aka low culture. Decades of hugging yankeeism (government isn't only guilty alone, people are, like the 1986 devolution, with "muh rights!" "muh democracy", and so on.), led to degeneration. </p>

<p>BTW, what would be your plans for your country?</p>
