	Religion: Depends on the religion, of course. I see faith built on the truth of our world as an essential to a healthy civilization and without it its people will only fall into a state of eternal degeneration.<br /><br />
	Jews: Well, there's no such thing as a good Jew.<br /><br />
	Faggotry: It is impossible for a truly healthy civilization to coexist with faggotry, as it can and will only ever lead to degeneration.<br />
