<p>My family is of traditional Catholic orientation &amp; many of them have always held steadfast to old, traditional German values; my antisemitism radicalized throughout my travels, meeting many jews who were a stark contrast to the loyal image displayed by some German jews; these foreign jews were such a stark contrast in the sense they often looked upon me with contempt, fear or both for my affiliation with national socialism, and for being German alone, essentially. Prior to that - I had the idea that as long as a jew assimilated &amp; put forth his German identity above all, that there was no issue. </p>
<p>I had let my rationality run astray due to my vehement anger with these types, and it has blinded me to a point where I - at times - cannot distinguish between those of your kind that are truly loyal to our faith, values and cause &amp; those who wish to usurp them for their own benefit. But I am a German, and I will not forsake my own if they truly are my own. </p>
<p>I also support the everlasting-defensive battle against the Muslims, as it is a call from the Holiest of sources for both Jews &amp; Christians alike. Their threat is very real - I have never ignored this fact; I have come to see black Muslims as an even lower-grade version of their Arabic counterparts, but even more threatening due to their tendency to reproduce almost like bunnies &amp; their commonly-held savagery.</p>
