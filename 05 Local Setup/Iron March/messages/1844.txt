<p>That's a good idea.</p>

<p>I understand what you mean; I'm just not sure if that would actually result from the policy you want to put through.</p>

<p>Well I wouldn't call a multiple-vote system rigged. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> It's something, moreover, that Hungary has already written into their constitution. My system would, yes, end up needing to explain something very similar, but I still think yours would be more likely to provoke revolt unless introduced at least a generation in.</p>
