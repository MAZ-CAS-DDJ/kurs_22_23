	When I was browsing starwars.wiki also I used to get a Starwars magazine a long time ago the code may have been written in there can't remember. Oh and the Native American guy on here used it as a bannerÂ quote until people gave him shit for it.

	Peace is a lie there is only Passion
</p>

<p>
	Through Passion I gain Strength
</p>

<p>
	Through Strength I gain Power
</p>

<p>
	Through Power I gain Victory
</p>

<p>
	Through Victory my chains are broken the force shall set me free.
