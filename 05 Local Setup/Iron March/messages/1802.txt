<p>Actually that is justification for pedophilia, as good as advocacy as far as I'm concerned. And no, it's not evolution, because evolution speaks of the opposite: the more advanced an animal is the longer is the infant stage, hence why insects are born knowing what to do and mammals need nurturing and protection in infancy. As far as humanity goes, it is also compounded by social conditions, though history shows that we are actually progressing along the lines of longer infancy/child stage, ergo why there used to be 17 y/o rules of state back when and now that's not old enough to drive a car.</p>
<p>And on a medical note: while biological development of a human body is complete rather early, the psychological development takes a while longer and the determined overall average age for both full psychological and biological development is 17, ergo why de juro the age of adulthood in most societies is set at 18 - <em>to play it safe</em>.</p>
<p>There's nothing you can say to make me change my mind. And it's also the creepy pedo-esque way you put it. "Splitting teen oak".</p>
