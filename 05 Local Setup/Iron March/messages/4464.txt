<p>Hi, as the forum is still down I came acorss something relevant to the topic you made. There is a new broadcast group that put out a show every day 'renegade radio' live, its mission statement is something to the effect that christian undertones are what have ruined most of the other alternative and white nationalist media sources for many reasons. despite being based on the nietzche/pagan/atheist thing, they seem like pretty fantastic people - the quality of the shows are 5/5 even though there are lots of contributors</p>
<p>I listened to these two shows today which are fresh in my mind as something I recommend. they are long but worth it.</p>

<p>The round table discussions deal witht he religious debate aspect.</p>
<p>Greg Johnson of all people gave a good interview - the RNP one was also interesting.</p>
