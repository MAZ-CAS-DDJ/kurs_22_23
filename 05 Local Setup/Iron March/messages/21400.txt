<p>
	Your intentions were good, and you still want the betterment of your people only now it's not your primary concern - but eventually by aiming higher you will get closer to the realization of that particular goal too. I don't think I have ever read C. S. Lewis before, but they posted a <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/52-your-favorite-quotes/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=195743" rel="">quote</a> by him which perfectly fits here; something I always agreed with only couldn't word it:
</p>

<p>
	<em>Aim at Heaven and you will get earth 'thrown in': aim at earth and you will get neither. It seems a strange rule, but something like it can be seen at work in other matters. Health is a great blessing, but the moment you make health one of your main, direct objects you start becoming a crank and imagining there is something wrong with you. You are only likely to get health provided you want other things more - food, games, work, fun, open air. In the same way, we shall never save civilisation as long as civilisation is our main object. We must learn to want something else even more.</em>
</p>

<p>
	In Matthew 5:17 Christ says: <em>"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them".</em> Same applies to your older beliefs; the main notion was noble but narrow-minded and thus easily could have been led to falsehoods. This is one of the reasons for why I constantly talk about Unity, the Absolute and Imperialism; not necessarily in the sense of worldly expansion but rather as transcendence towards the Highest aim we can have. If one achieves a goal and his victory won't lead him to set an even higher goal then he can as well throw away everything he won for his triumph was an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	This rule is so important that if we could truly awake within ourselves the Will for Truth, for the Final Absolute, we would instantly become one with It. No further actions would be needed because we would understand the Cosmic Order, we would see not just every process but their source and outcome too - and if one would realize he has already won, he could finally lay down his weapons.

			I told them that from now on I support Iranian nationalism and I just want Iran to take over all of Kurdistan, since the whole issue is just a sub-conflict within the greater fascist world-conflict. And of course Kurds are Iranian anyway, so the best situation for Kurds would be for all that land to be under one united Iran.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Kurds should stay Kurds in their own region while recognizing the fact that they are a part of the Iranian nation, like the Ukrainian <em>people</em> are a part of the Russian <em>nation</em>. The latter is a good example of how can outer powers turn brothers against each other by exploiting their rightful will for self-preservation. So even if Kurdish Nationalism is wrong because it understands Kurds as a nation instead of a people, if Iran would begin to assimilate them and by that destroying their traditions it would be just as bad, and Kurdish Nationalism would become an understandable (even if not appropriate) reaction to that.
</p>

<p>
	Organic unity is made up of differentiated parts forming a functioning body; and this law works on a myriad of different levels: different classes shall form a people whilst maintaining their inherent characters, different people shall form a nation whilst maintaining their own natures, different nations shall form an empire whilst maintaining their traditions, all along up until the One including everything. This process of gradual dissolution of structures is one way of understanding the fall of man. In history, this domino effect is just as obvious as the tactic of its agents who always explain their actions as motivated by the protection of lower structures (against the higher ones). Empires, nations, peoples all fell for this deception presenting itself in Nationalism, Communism, or Capitalism and it goes further every time with Feminism being its most recent manifestation. It has to be seen though that precisely because of this, every one of these ideologies have a righteous element for preservation in them (the further you go back in time the greater this element becomes), thus they all work two ways: Capitalists want to destroy the community but protect the family from Feminism, Communists want to destroy the nation but protect the community from Capitalism, Nationalists want to destroy the empire but protect the nation from Communism, and so on. The great thing in historical Fascism is that although it was connected to all of these modern ideologies (minimally to Capitalism, notably to Communism, greatly to Nationalism), it was able to purify their positive components, reverse the process of dissolution and begin to rise back to greater principles like the pan-European idea (and beyond) you mentioned. That's what we can perceive in economic Corporatism (purification of the Capitalistic element), in the doctrine of class cooperation (purification of the Communistic element), and in the peace offers, the treatment of the conquered nations, the SS and in many other cases (purification of the Nationalistic element).
</p>

<p>
	It can be argued that this phenomenon was present in <a href="https://stalins-followers.deviantart.com/journal/Stalinism-Marxist-or-Traditionalist-251856588" rel="external nofollow">Stalinism</a> as well, but even if that's true, ultimately it wasn't able to get rid of the negative influences of Communism.
</p>

<p>
	I presume you are aware of that, but you guys should really watch out for the Ukrainian happenings for it's an open secret that the creation of Kurdistan is a geopolitical possibility outer powers will surely try to use for their purposes (probably to further destabilize the region by weaken every state there). According to what Nikolajević said it is also a grim reminder of what happens to otherwise good people blinded by Chauvinism - on the Russian side those 'Fascists' who were killing Ukrainian 'Fascists' ended up being assassinated by their own compatriots for being 'Fascists'.

<p>
	To be quite honest with you fam, I am in a very similar situation, and it's not just us. I really want to organize and start doing shit but my life is still a mess and even if it wouldn't be and I'd have a movement I still lack a clear plan. A lot of talk is going on about <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/8224-somewhat-of-a-cry-for-help/" rel="">this</a> lately, and even if Cannon's post made me optimistic first, when it comes to the implementation one have to realize he needs a lot of things in order to free himself from the System. For example, I can think of maybe three guys here in Hungary who are action-oriented and woke enough to understand what we discussed here, but they are already occupied with other movements, even if they admit that those organizations aren't really working (one of them is a member of Jobbik lol). There were two Hungarian newbies lately; one of them disappeared after a while and the other begun his IM career by stating in his intro how he is part Jewish. -_-' Otherwise he seems okay, but reading <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/8154-hausser-exam-results-o/" rel="">his exam</a> gave me the impression as if he just repeated the official IM dogmas without actually believing them (this wasn't the only test which made me feel this way, but it could be that was the whole purpose of the IM-EE - NAZI CONDITIONING). That's four men in total, with their own IRL and organization activities, schools and/or jobs, friends, girlfriends and stuff. Talking with the IM members didn't make me any more certain either, since they brought up many valid arguments against this somewhat Isolationist plan of Cannon, yet I still see this as one of the best options and from time to time I come up with some ideas for it too. The Hungarian comrade I trust the most (and who will register to IM in the future) said that both of us are in the phase of preparation - I would say this applies to you too, even more so with these recent events.
</p>

<p>
	I also went to a little meeting with this guy and two others (on our way we passed through a certain village so I had to ask the driver to stop and my comrade to take a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZhcezHi.jpg" rel="external nofollow">photo</a>). I got massively blackpilled there. They say that Baranyi sympathizes more and more with Dugin's vision of the 4PT as the only viable way for us, and it seems that he tries to seize the control over the Traditionalist circle by supporting various <a href="https://coub.com/view/vt61q" rel="external nofollow">cringy groups</a> <em>(the guy says this meeting will be a massive thing people haven't seen in a long time)</em> led by people loyal to him, while calling others "Lászlóists" and such (also it turns out that András László likes Burger King but I won't even go into that). The funny thing is that every one of the leaders of these groups are obsessed with some particularity (let it be fitness, legal advocacy or "<a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/8141-greetings/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=199789" rel="">metapolitics</a>" which they see as the only way to salvation and it looks like that Baranyi confirms their retarded beliefs to maintain his grip on them, even if this results in petty infightings. What makes the whole scenario bizarre is that Baranyi was already the de facto leader of the circle, so these actions of him come off as an aggressive move to enforce his strategy. Yet there is no single pattern to be applied universally; the principle stated in the 3rd question of the IM-EE is relevant all the way down to the individual level: encourage everybody to do what they do best, then organize and cooperate while avoiding both infighting and forced homogenization.
</p>

<p>
	Turns out that one can be among the wisest of his nation, if he isn't aware of the current situation and thus doesn't understand the practical/pragmatic problems we are facing today then a bunch of guys in their twenties (&amp; skullmasks) will network with much greater efficiency, regardless of how deep their understanding of Metaphysics is
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	As for what to do, start by looking around you and building connections. The guy from AW told me they sent you away, but there are other options especially if you can afford traveling within the US. We have a lot of burgers here on IM and I bet that some of them would be interested in having talks similar to ours. If you are in Kurdistan, contact the Kurds of Turkey who are sympathetic towards Iran, check out the Traditional communities and the Sufi groups you mentioned. Trust is one of the most important things we are lacking today; it's like a rare plant: first we have to find its seeds, than plant them in fertile soil and nurture the sprouts so they can grow and bear fruits in the future. IM is like a fucking granary in this metaphor. For example, I have started to chat with the Bulgarian horsebros on discord and soon with Misanthrope we realized that we are so similar in our mentality that now we are calling each other astral bros and whatnot. :D We are shitposting, throwing banters and sharing our silly little thoughts and stories with each other daily and plan to meet in person in the near future too - a gathering like <a href="http://www.lukovmarsh.info/what-is-lukovmarch/" rel="external nofollow">Lukovmarch</a> promises a good opportunity for that (I've asked them boys and you are free to come if you'll have the chance). There, besides strengthening these bonds hopefully we will learn the tricks of the trade from the representatives of the invited organizations. I hope they will invite CasaPound too because my Hungarian comrade told me that when he went to Italy he was amazed by how powerful that openly Fascist movement is.

<p>
	I've talked with Baranyi about you and how we are learning from each other and he started his letter by saying this is a very exciting thing. ^_^ I was one of his students during what would have been a three-year lecture series but lasted for only one. Here is a translation of the parts of his message which are likely relevant to you:
</p>

<p>
	<em>Obviously there are many Traditional communities (especially compared to what we have here which is virtually none), and likely there are Traditionalist ones as well. Unfortunately their general anti-Turkish sentiment keeps the Kurds away from a lot of opportunities in this regard; and the Sufi orders I personally know are mostly Turkish-related (Naqshbandi, or Mevlevi-Jerrahi for example). In any case, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Against-Modern-World-Traditionalism-Intellectual/dp/0195396014" rel="external nofollow">this book</a> has a chapter on Turkish Traditionalism, as well as another on Iranian Traditionalism. (The book itself is almost completely inadequate on the essential issues; the only thing what makes it remarkable is its extensive uncovering of data. There is a chance that it is a CIA-report disguised in a scientific manner. We are featured as well.)</em>
</p>

<p>
	<em>I myself am looking for these kinds of connections too, but it is not so easy to find them in this situation. (*insert Jobbik shit-stirring here*) I wanted to go Iran since the last year to partake in the greatest Shi'a ceremony the Ashura, but I lack the right contact I used to have with Turkey.</em>
</p>

<p>
	<em>Another important thing. They say there is a Sufi tariqah with the transcendent unity of religions (or something equivalent to it) as one of its "secret teachings". The name of the order is 'Akhbariya' or something similar (the spelling can vary). I would be obliged if you could find out more about them.</em>
</p>

<p>
	Maybe not the fruits you were looking for, but it was a fruitful message. Have you heard about that tariqah? I've asked my Algerian buddy from IM and this was the first time he saw my the message but didn't replied to it. Creepy!
</p>

<p>
	Yes, to my understanding one of the reasons for this behavior became mainstream in the contemporary (and especially the IM-inspired) movements is that people got fed up with pharisees. I translate another letter, this time by myself. I was talking with Deimos/Hausser about this kind of people:
</p>

<p>
	<em>I meant the lack of "Have fun!". Don't misunderstand me, but in a way we have to uphold within ourselves a neutral orientation until the end, an 'apocalyptic position' from where we can laugh in the face of our greatest catastrophes and say "that's it, at least we had fun". None of the Hungarian movements were able to do that, however it would be essential to overcome obstacles as basic as the shock/butthurt of Trianon. Shit happens, we took a big blow, but that's it and now it's there from where we have to continue fighting. (...) A little indifference towards Creation can oil the wheels of ideology pretty well. That's what I see in the IM-inspired movements; they are perfectly aware of that they are not the holy crusaders of Fascism but stupid kids running around and putting up posters, and this humbleness is exactly what makes them able to move on and one day may really became the holy crusaders of Fascism. If you know where you stand you can proceed and act instead of daydreaming about how you will regain lost territories. Every time someone launches an organization here, he immediately thinks he became our savior and starts to spawn a myriad of panegyrics from his disgusting shit of a website up until the point when "(((they))) ban him" (meaning: the technologically imbecile haven't paid for the domain) and when the members realize that flyers, tours and airsoft trainings (which are OK otherwise) won't save the country.</em>
</p>

<p>
	So yes, there is a playful attitude here but I welcome it as a suitable stance towards the System, the Kali Yuga and the broader outer world, as long as the inner world is taken seriously at all time.

	We can never be sure about this; e.g. my friend who was in the HQ of CasaPound told me they have an altar there. Also I remember reading <a href="http://golden-dawn-international-newsroom.blogspot.hu/2013/08/democratic-terrorism.html" rel="external nofollow">this article</a> and wondering about how intact the ancient Hellenic mysteries could be if the Pagan members of GD are actually performing rituals and all (even if in the article they stated that it was just an 'educational trip'). I was trying to gather some more information from Hellenic Nationalist, but he told me he can't say much aside from that Greeks have a lot of pagan traditions on national, regional and cultic level as well. I've also asked Slavros if he knows anything on these topics. Regarding the Italian scene he replied with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Fascist_Mysticism" rel="external nofollow">wikilink</a> (I haven't read it through yet) but he don't know about any esoteric activity within the contemporary movements. He mentioned that there was an "Evola university" and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Nazi_Party#New_Order" rel="external nofollow">New Order</a> used a lot of Evola's ideas but that's it.

			Although, come to think of it, I’d venture to say that even the NSDAP and Iron Guard didn’t go far enough either. I have this idea, that if a fascist group doesn’t spend a good chunk of its efforts on alchemy and astrology and other Traditional sciences, then it really isn’t fascist enough, regardless of how successful it is on other fronts. What do you think about that?

<p>
	I have asked two Romanians from IM and a very well-read Hungarian guy whom I met on the 'blackpill party' if they know anything about the esoteric aspects of the Nazis and/or the Legionnaires - the Romanians couldn’t tell me anything and my friend asked for some time before answering this question.
</p>

<p>
	I was also thinking, couldn't be that these movements look too materialistic simply because of the nature of Esotericism/Occultism? After all, what we are searching for here is literally 'hidden knowledge'; accessible to the chosen few who were initiated by the masters (this applies to Evola and his heritage you referred to). We can't really expect that a mass movement (in the case of the NSDAP and the later Iron Guard) won't cover all of its spiritual activities which could have been seen as something heretical in the eyes of the people they wanted to lead. They say that a lot of official documentation was destroyed in the last months of the war too, and you can bet that those who have something on the subject will try to keep it secret whether they are our enemies or our comrades.
</p>

<p>
	This field is extremely difficult to explore, but if I manage to find something I will let you know.

			To be honest with you, this whole spiritual crisis made me want to go and start such a group by myself. If I can’t join a fascist holy order—hell, I’ll just go make one. The main problem is in actually having the necessary spiritual strength to do so.

<p>
	The right disposition of that strength or in other words the sequence of your actions is of utmost importance: you don't have the spiritual strength to establish a Fascist order yet, but you have just enough to transform yourself into someone who has more of that strength. The question is who would that be? What should you do first? I also ask this from myself and the only answer I ever got was to start with the small things. Try to find out what your greatest sin is and strike it viciously. I was thinking about freedom while listening 'A Squire's Tale' a few days ago and realized that if we would be ready, we could leave behind everything in any moment just like that.

	I want to cleanse Fascism of every modernistic element (primarily Chauvinism) and Hungary to transcend its pathetic state through Futurism. In order to do that I will have to train myself, then pick up the moschetto and adventure, meet with good comrades, fight against the enemy and fuck nice women. I want to gather enough knowledge and strength to become a real Fascist for my forties so that I can serve our cause and die a fine death before growing old.

<p>
	Indeed, András László also mentioned how it's a spiritual joy to read Hamvas. :) His masterpiece is called 'Scientia Sacra' and it's naturally on my list already. I can't say much about him though, until now I've only read a few of his essays including these two you mentioned. Let me share some of my thoughts on them.
</p>

<p>
	<em>The Seventh Symphony and the Metaphysics of Music:</em>
</p>

<p>
	In the 2nd point he writes: <em>"He lacks the power to stand up and drop to his knees. He lacks restraint, morality, religion, weakness; he lacks the strength to be weak, and the capacity for gratitude."</em>
</p>

<p>
	This is typically something what liberals would quote by him, and even if it can be interpreted as a call for humility which I stress a lot myself, the way he words it makes it sound like as if he would glorify weakness. IronFalx taught me that true humility is inseparable from shame because man can't just accept his weakness after becoming aware of it. I can't sense shame here.
</p>

<p>
	If we explain that in relation to point 4 however, it can be seen as the Self dealing a blow to the ego. The other thing he is talking about here is the Androgynos, and according to András László Hamvas's perception on that was fundamentally wrong: he thought that the man has to strengthen his feminine side while the woman has to do the same with her masculine side - basically awake anima and animus, and 'meet each other in the middle'. László says this is absolutely incorrect as it would result in half-man-half-woman beings (who are less and less uncommon in our era), and the Androgynos is not that, but the unity of a whole man and a whole woman - thus men have to became more masculine and women have to become more feminine to achieve that, to generate this great tension between them by which they can "blast into each other".
</p>

<p>
	The 11th point made me feel a little sad since I am not that musical to understand what he wrote there. :D
</p>

<p>
	The 17th point is my favorite:
</p>

<p>
	<em>This music cannot be resisted. The entire world begins to hurt with such elementary force from the boundless depths of humanity; the tempter appears, the longing for death, longing for death in shimmering dress, smiling, promising joyful splendor, flattering with the softness of dreams. At once one finds that he wants to lie down then and there and sleep where he is, to fall asleep in death's eternal silence, awaiting its shining, colorless idyll, until slowly, like the beating of a white bird’s wings, death raises him up and flies away with him into the void.</em>
</p>

<p>
	<em>The Preface to Crime and Punishment:</em>
</p>

<p>
	The definition of Careerism was spot on, but he associates the word with people who had nothing to do with it. He stresses responsibility which is good and the concept of 'existential corruption' is also great. He writes: <em>"quite obviously, the identification of Christianity with socialism is naught but the grand, blatant and blinding madness of this century";</em> I will return to this later. Then there is another part: <em>"Socialism has shown us only one thing: that however miserable it may be to do so, poverty and starvation are still preferable to becoming a villain;"</em> - this made me remember 'The Province and Legionary Ideology' by Mircea Eliade (there is no English translation of it afaik), in which he writes:
</p>

<p>
	<em>Today things are starting to change I think. Today "Idealism” compels you to seek and accept reality. It does not mean opportunism and politicalism, but on the contrary, to realize the Romanian condition - to understand that this is a poor country with poor people and a harsh life. And to understand that out of this harsh life and with this poor people divine things can be done.</em>
</p>

<p>
	I was amazed the first time I was reading this revolutionary thought of embracing poverty - well, revolutionary in modernity, before that it was normal. The same modesty raised the former quasi-feudal states of Russia and China to the position of superpowers in recent history. But let's get back to the topic.
</p>

<p>
	Hamvas criticizes the Socialist element in Fascism, but he ignores the fact that it is 'the Socialism of Duty', with the same individual responsibility in its focus which he was emphasizing throughout his entire writing. You mentioned Allied propaganda; I also couldn't stop thinking about how similar Hamvas's arguing is to that of today's Libertarians. "Hurr-durr Socialism is theft, case closed."
</p>

<p>
	Also when he was talking about how the "union of nations" will have to dismantle Fascist and Communist states I lol'd beacuse of how that idea <a href="http://www.lifezette.com/polizette/united-nations-urges-u-s-give-free-speech-combat-racism/" rel="external nofollow">ended up</a> in practice.
</p>

<p>
	Btw he mentioned Coriolanus; have you seen the movie by Ralph Fiennes?
</p>

<p>
	There is a talk about Hamvas by András László on youtube, his main points were the following: They were good friends, and his respect towards Hamvas didn't lessen with time but became more refined and critical. All in all Hamvas was an acceptable thinker with many unacceptable thoughts. First he was an Evolian, later he turned to Guénon, Ziegler and Rudolf Pannwitz - but after 1945 he never uttered Evola's name again. In the same year he has joined the Hungarian Communist Party, which András László found out only after his death. The most disturbing thing about this is that up until 1948 the Soviet influence wasn't that massive in Hungary (in fact, the center-Right won the '45 elections) and Communism wasn't enforced thus Hamvas has chosen them freely. He would never accept the party's Materialist, Atheist and anti-Christian stance and also criticized their practice, saying it was Stalinist (exactly that rare element Fascists can admire in historical Communism) - finally they banned him around 1947, even if he shared a lot of their views (which he interpreted on a more spiritual level). Although accepting the reality of castes, Hamvas felt a certain antipathy towards every caste other than that of the Brahmins. He envisioned the Golden Age as the community of Brahmins and viewed the Marxist doctrine of 'Primitive Communism' as something in line with that, as if the realization of the Classless Society would be the beginning of the new Satya Yuga. He held that the essence of Christianity and Communism is the same (*Pagans are nodding*), and since according to him "Christianity is the realization of the Tradition", that concludes that every Tradition is pointing towards Communism. András László says that this delusion is such enormous it makes it a rare sight in the history of Philosophy. This idea however is not central in his life's work.
</p>

<p>
	Hamvas is probably the greatest Hungarian writer, but he is inclined to be emotional and calling him a traditional author would be just as correct as to call him an anti-traditional one, because these two states existed in him at the same time in a weird symbiosis. He should be read, but read with care for he writes about truth and falsehood with the same beauty. "He who wants to use Hamvas as a compass will get lost."

	Oh yes, before the recent events I was sure that Baranyi is the new 'Hungarian Evola' and thus the one to take the lead after András László steps down. I still believe that he is the most worthy (and action-oriented) around here, but I cannot be sure about his person anymore. Anyway, it's good to see how these men hand over the torch to each other. It's also amazing how AW established a link to Mason and through him reconnected the succession line between our community and the previous generation of Fascists.

	Yes, I read a little on it and there are a lot of parallels with Easter: the timing, preparing days before the event, cleaning the house, preparing a feast, lighting candles, decorating eggs, eating lentils and so on. The regional versions are also interesting. The tradition as it is held in Azerbaijan caught my attention because of the Alchemical symbolism and the Iranian one has a custom similar to Halloween and you even have a Santa figure. You should add the 21th of March to the dates of the Calendar really, it's not just Solar but Aryan af.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I didn't read much Hafez but for me it seems that he and Hamvas would have been really good friends, provided the universe could supply them with enough wine. :D Hamvas constantly laid stress on the importance of maintaining serenity as a natural, healthy attitude towards the world and I see the same thing in Hafez. You can't just understand this kind of poets as they work with so much emotions that you need to be in the exact right mood to see what they meant - so again, it's no surprise that modernfuckers will misinterpret them, they couldn't do otherwise even if they wanted to. Hafez's mentions of alcohol and love can be both allegorical and literal though, and it still wouldn't make him a degenerate. You see, a mystic’s and a commoner's drunkenness is not the same thing. <em>Quod licet Iovi, non licet bovi</em> - if he has the philosopher's stone, the Alchemist can turn <em>anything</em> into gold. András László mentioned types of tantric yoga straight looking for 'the greatest tigers to ride' so to speak; for the transformation of forces being the primary agents of the Kali Yuga. These are all attacking one's consciousness, like intoxication or sexual delirium (physical combat belongs here too). It's the Left-Hand Path basically, which is becoming hegemonic with the advance of Involution. One of its dangers is that people nowadays seem to confuse that which they should rule over with that which they should become. Rumi explain this very clearly:

<p>
	<em>So it behoves a man to eschew these pleasures and delights, which are the ray and reflection of God. He must not become content with this much; even though this much is of God's grace and the radiance of His beauty, yet it is not eternal. With reference to God it is eternal, with reference to man it is not eternal. It is like the rays of the sun which shine into houses; for all that they are the rays of the sun and are light, yet they are attached to the sun. When the sun sinks, the light no more remains. Hence it behoves us to become the Sun, so that the fear of separation may no more remain.</em>
</p>

<p>
	I tend to agree with you on the difference between him and Hafez but again, I am far from knowing their poetry. From what I gathered Hafez is characterized by loud vitality while Rumi is much more lucid (like in the aforementioned writing about the sun, or in the one called <em>'Busy yourself with that head'</em>). I came across a Hungarian translation of two of his discourses from <a href="http://rumisite.com/Books/FiheMaFih.pdf" rel="external nofollow">this book</a> (discourse 1 &amp; 2), and some of those written there are connected to what you said about free will:
</p>

<p>
	<em>However, when scholars do not study to please princes, but instead pursue learning from first to last for the sake of truth—when their actions and words spring from the truth they have learned and put to use because this is their nature and they cannot live otherwise—just as fish can only thrive in water—such scholars subject themselves to the control and direction of God. (…) They are like the light-giving sun, whose whole function is giving to all, universally, converting stones into rubies and carnelians, changing mountains into mines of copper, gold, silver and iron, making the earth fresh and green, bringing fruit to the trees, and warmth to the breeze. Their trade is giving, they do not receive.</em>
</p>

<p>
	<em>Even now in your fear, you still hold onto your beliefs and do not see the One Reality over you. (…) But because you put your trust in your own plans, losing sight of God, and forgetting that all things proceed from God, all your intentions have turned out the opposite. (…) Yet, even in your present state, my friend, do not give up hope, but look to God and give yourself up to Its will. (…) My purpose in speaking this way to the Amir was so that he could see the matter correctly, and accept the will of God humbly. He has fallen out of an exceedingly high state into a low state, yet in this way he may grow </em>(nice definition of Involution there)<em>. (…) So do not put your trust in every idea and every notion, but only in God and Its wisdom.</em>
</p>

<p>
	It looks like as if there would be two conflicting views, both in Rumi's and in our discourse but that's not the case. Maybe a few metaphor/parallel will make this clear:
</p>

<p>
	1. What is beyond the cosmological horizon? Most of the people imagine that matter spreads into an empty space already there, but in reality the expansion of the universe is the expansion of space itself. There is nothing beyond it.
</p>

<p>
	2. What is beyond consciousness? The moment an idea enters your mind you catch that and it becomes yours like it was always there. Those aren't coming from below existence (outside), but from its source, from above it (inside).
</p>

<p>
	3. What is beyond God? I remember asking Baranyi if it is possible for someone to exist completely separated from God. He told me that's the mystery of Satan. Because of that there is no rational explanation for it, but just like Baranyi did, I'll try to help grasping this thought. Satan is the idea of nothingness, the One who draws everything towards that. This tendency clearly exists, but in the moment it succeeds in something it vanishes together with its subject, elements of which are sinking back to the Prakrti, the sea of passive/reactive potentiality, while leaving its essence intact in the world of ideals within the Purusha. The Natural Order works similarly on the material level: you can go against the iron laws of Nature but <a href="https://youtu.be/QM_GhrHq3MQ?t=11m24s" rel="external nofollow">it will damage you, not Her</a>. Your essence, man's ideal will not be lost and the rest will decay and sink back to earth only to re-emerge as components of other material forms embodying different ideals. In the end, Satan is but a delusion, a bad dream of the Self.
</p>

<p>
	<em>"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."</em> - heh, I didn't know that this was from a movie. Anyway, it's a good line, only it has to be added that if the Devil would say the opposite it would be just as false. He is called the Lord of Lies for a reason.
</p>

<p>
	Let's get back to the first metaphor for a moment. You see, we live inside a gigantic material symbol of Involution where everything is getting further away from the Centrum (Truth/God). Scientists discovered that this phenomenon would be experienced the same regardless of the position of the observer: wherever you are in the universe, everything is receding from you. And from the fact that the center is always with the spectator they concluded there is no center <em>at all</em>. This Relativism is the endpoint of the corruption of the physical worldview, but also a chance to realize that if there is no fixed reference point on the material/objectivist level then MAYBE it's time to look for it elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
	You have also mentioned the Hindu truth of the Self, which clearly explains that even if <em>your person</em> is in the bottom of the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/HyiwsTK.png" rel="external nofollow">pyramid</a>, the whole pyramid itself is inside <em>yourself.</em>
</p>

<p>
	All in all, I say the question of free will is a question of two perspectives; of who asks it, the ego or the Self? The Divine Plan will be fulfilled, and man can decide if he becomes a part of it or ceases to exist.
</p>

<p>
	I knew about this attitude of Islam, and always saw it as the sign of the Dark Age (also present in Christianity only on a smaller scale); which grants time in exchange for the predominance of the exoteric aspect (as you explained the line "You know not, but God knows"). Honestly, I have no idea which one is worse, tolerating every kind of degeneracy or beheading everyone who differs from the most primitive interpretation of a particular Tradition. We are between Scylla and Charybdis.

			It’s interesting, by the way, that we already seem to be discussing the very highest steps of spirituality here, even though we’re quite lost and we’re not sure exactly where we are right now. Of course, it’s necessary to first know where we’ll be going—i.e. the thread of Ariadne!—and then we’ll be able to see where we are now. But then again, this still seems to be the big problem for most of us… just, where are we right now? We know that we will end at One, and we’re obviously not at the Chaotic beginning, but how far along the process are we exactly? Are we at 12? At 7? At 666? This is why we need genuine initiation centers ffs. God, I hate the modern world.

			Wow, that passage was so great! It contains so much truth, and it sums up the whole issue so neatly. I’ve read about the difference between these two paths in so many books, but it all makes so much sense when you put it this way. It actually reminds me of a diagram at the beginning of John Dee’s Monas Hieroglyphica, which shows two paths—one ending in the person becoming a Tyrant (which in this conversation would mean Occultism), while the other ends in him becoming Spiritual (which would be Transcendence). I’m pretty sure you’re referring to the same thing here, although John Dee then goes on to elaborate on it and takes it further. Check it out if you haven’t yet.

	Could you provide me a good source on Monas Hieroglyphica? I have found the Y diagram but couldn't really make out the details. Wow, I haven't heard that Devi wrote a book on Akhenaten - another one added to the list. How much do you know about Egypt by the way?

			One thing though: would it not be possible to follow both of those two paths?

<p>
	Depends on what do you mean, because these words have more interpretations if I understand them correctly. In one sense, they are truly ways, analogues with the Right-Hand and Left-Hand paths: while the way of Transcendence is focused, straight, direct, serious and ascetic, that of Occultism is extensive, spiral, indirect, playful and vivid. The Transcendent journey is a task, the Occult is an adventure; he who walks the former tries to shut out the outer world as a distraction so that he can concentrate on ascension and nothing else, while he who walks the latter embraces the creation and can't wait to interact with it as he grows in power. Ultimately the line and the upward, narrowing spiral both end in the same point where they become two fates (I was using them in this sense last time). In this phase the initiate is the King of the World, the Demiurge, who can choose between turning up to the Heavens (Transcendent) or down to his Kingdom (Occult), and with that decide his destiny.
</p>

<p>
	Mind you that this is just my interpretation, but according to it you can't follow both paths, at least not as an individual. It is possible however to get to the top with one and then chose the destiny of the another, even more so because as I mentioned above, the Right-Hand/Transcendent path is almost impossible to walk in our age. In an ideal scenario that would work in a second - you decide you want to wake up and then you just wake up; but we have so many interferences today that for most of us it's impossible to enter into a pure state of mind. The only other option is the Occult one which accepts that we can't escape from those effects and pursues to transform them in a way so that we can use them for our benefit.
</p>

<p>
	My knowledge on Islam is very limited but given the fact that it is a legitimate Tradition I would say Mohammad achieved Transcendence through Occultism.

	Exactly. Remember what I said about free will: the Divine Plan will be carried out either way.

			But also, in another way, I can’t help but think—isn’t it becoming easier as well? The way I think about it, I’d say the masses are becoming so weak that they can fall for anything. I’d say that, given a sufficiently powerful propaganda machine, Integralism is still very much possible.

<p>
	There was a time when I was thinking the same, but this won't work. You didn't take into account that their qualities are worsening every day in every way. They can surely <em>fall</em> for anything; but we want them to get up. By this I mean that we want to (re-)establish standards and want them to hold themselves to those while our enemies are toppling standards one after another. We can't possibly win the masses in a battle like this because while we would demand self-sacrifice the enemy would promise more liberty, and in the current materialist mindset people wouldn't even understand our position. Lemmings can't grasp the most basic concepts we take as natural. I have some of this kind even in my family and believe me they are spiritually dead beyond salvation.
</p>

<p>
	There is a part in Hamvas's preface to Crime and Punishment pointing at this fact:
</p>

<p>
	<em>Socialism owes much of its power to permitting existential corruption; in other words, to acknowledging the confiscation of property as an act of justice. This sort of thing was very appealing to everyone at the time. People have been rebelling against the Gospels for two thousand years precisely because it refused to permit such a convenient solution; it even restricted people from calling each other mad.</em>
</p>

<p>
	Read 'The Country of the Blind' by H. G. Wells or just think about the allegory of the Cave (holy shit I just realized that my relative is literally going 'back to the cave' - his darkened room - to watch TV all day voluntarily). We would have to either trick them and somehow 'outjew the Jew' or wait until the right time and then go full SIEGE if we want to care about people's future (which I am not so sure about anymore).

			Another thing I’m thinking about is that in the ideal scenario we could have both Integralism and Isolation together, creating a societal structure where the masses are streamlined toward God while also simultaneously creating fascist initiation centers that exist outside the society and could (and must) survive without them. And I don’t just mean this in an esoteric/exoteric sense, but in a sense where the initiation centers are totally outside the society. Wouldn’t this achieve both goals, with Integralism and Isolation combined together?

			What I don’t get though is how this explains the corruption of the Boreans by the Tropicals. Are you saying that because the Boreans conquered the Tropicals, they’re becoming corrupted by them—but meanwhile Eastern Europe and the Middle East didn’t conquer the Tropicals as much, and so they haven’t been corrupted by them to the same extent as the Boreans?

<p>
	Nah, it did not happen because of 'ebul huWhite kolonializum', but because the colonizers lacked the spiritual quality which would justify their mission (most of the time they were lacking that too but nvm that). This one is from the 1st discourse of Rumi:
</p>

<p>
	<em>The Arabs have expressed this in a proverb: “We have learned in order to give, we have not learned in order to take.”</em>
</p>

<p>
	The Aryan mission is to conquer, but to conquer for Truth and nothing else. Our history haven't witnessed such a conquest in a very long time now, with the exception of our favorite Fascist struggle, but that wasn't started out as noble either, only became that along the way (as I described above). The vast majority of the conflicts we know of were fought for interests - even if social, national or religious -, and were fought by the wrong people against the wrong enemy (with some exceptions ofc). With these conditions it was natural that the conquered eventually overcame those who were not fit to rule over them and reversed the flow of power so that their influence would become dominant.

	Seriously, it would be extremely complicated to find what you are looking for here. First of all, we don't know <em>how</em> should we begin - the Materialist/Evolutionist method would be a dead end but there is no esoteric Archaeology afaik (remember the concept of 'Sacred Geography’? - that's still a concept). Secondly, we don't know <em>where</em> should we begin – we could start to search through all of our sources in reverse chronological order but there is absolutely no guarantee that our researchers could understand the ancient writings, and even if they could we would quickly run out of sources. Thirdly, we don't know <em>what</em> to look for - we have no idea about the period or the state of incarnation; and I haven't even mentioned the practical problems like the energy needed for such a grandiose research, the political atmosphere needed for the expeditions to be conducted (and their results to be trusted), and the equipment needed for 'unearthing' Atlantis for example.
</p>

<p>
	I was playing with the idea for a while that maybe Samis are the closest to Aryans because 1. they are pretty close to the North Pole, 2. they look like as if they were both Europids and Mongolids, 3. I've found some nice pictures about them on google. :DD
</p>

<p>
	The main problem with speculations like this is that we base our assumptions on views influenced by Modernism. The concept of the Androgynos I mentioned is a good example: Hamvas interpreted the original idea on a lower level and thus arrived to a totally false conclusion. The goal of sexuality is to restore the Androgynos which means that it exceeds the sexual level and most likely the physical level too (although one could use the depictions of Akhenaten to counter this statement). It's like Alchemy, we have all the ingredients but can't do much without the right formula, and mixing them together causes only trouble. It could be that our perception of the Aryans is similarly flawed in being too Materialistic and Biology-oriented. I remember reading somewhere that the Nazis tried to locate the third eye by opening up the skull and looking for it in the brain - the validity of this story is irrelevant in this case; the point is that it sheds light on the wrong approach.

	Usually my first approach towards new ideas is skeptic whatever they may be. That caused me some problems (1-2 weeks ago Niko wanted to gas me because I was arguing that they take miscegenation too seriously), but I believe this attitude comes handy in differentiating truth from falsehoods. Both literal interpretation and abstraction have dangers to them we should be aware of. Experience would be a conclusive factor if it would be something more significant than my 23 minute 'catnaps' which feel like if I was sleeping for years, and the well-known slowing effect of boredom.

<p>
	The question of the bloodline is another tricky one. On one hand, the teaching of Jesus is exactly that through free will, everybody has the potential to enter the Heavenly Kingdom regardless of his earthly conditions. That's why I believe that He was in fact a Jew by blood and this just makes his message even more revolutionary - anyone can be saved and it's entirely depends on them. In short, cut the bullshit and take responsibility for yourself whoever you are; if the Kike did it you can do it too! On the other hand, the importance of blood was emphasized so much throughout history that from the Pharaohs to the Habsburgs dynasties went as far as to engage in incest in order to keep their bloodlines pure. If you think about their mythological origins you can even see the logic behind that - after all, they were related to gods, so for them mixing with commoners would be something between miscegenation and bestiality. In a sense, Christianity and Islam brought a new type of legitimism to an era where the castes were already dissolving and Fascist leaders also proved how they are more legitimate than the good-for-nothing heirs of once great families.
</p>

<p>
	To say that I am unknowing when it comes to magic would be a euphemism, but I suspect that you can only perceive it after becoming involved in it. That's the 'trial' so to speak. I tend to believe in the miracles you mentioned but mulling over them would bring me dangerously close to Christianity.

			Now, my initial inclination (I’m 60% sure) is that the magic is indeed all true, and that the ancient Aryans were possibly even extraterrestrial aliens that came from other planets and colonized Hyperborea, and that the likes of Jesus were the final descendants of these Nordic aliens.

	Eeeh… this sounds way too Materialistic to me. Theories like that are usually stemming from the literal interpretations of Traditions talking about our descent to Earth or our 'otherworldly' origins - but these are not &gt;alien&lt; to us, quite on the contrary; they are closer to our essence. Apart from that I am also interested in this topic, we were even talking about this with the guys lately. One of the Bulgarians told us his true story so<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQoRXhS7vlU" rel="external nofollow"> get in the mood</a> and let me share it with you:
</p>

<p>
	<em>When he served in the military, my father was stationed in the middle of nowhere in a radar station together with one friend of his, in the freezing cold winter. They saw something that was very unusual on the radar. It wasn't a plane, and there wasn't any plane that was going to go there anyways, so they had sound the alarm and MIGs flew after it - but it just flew off. After the incident there were rumors that aliens are going to land in Sofia, and stories about some hemaphrodite alien that lived 20-30 meters underground, below some village. At one point the entire village was escorted out by military and military police and scientists went there to examine it for months. Nobody actually knows what they found but referring to some "leaks" some claim they captured that hemaphrodite alien.</em>
</p>

<p>
	<em>That's all the alien stories I have, beside my parents seeing some weird flying figure almost every time they go fishing in the middle of nature and it's not doing normal patterns. Also the tons of stories that I've heard of people deep in the mountains seeing things in the sky - there are also stories of MIGs chasing them which I've tried to look up for a long time without any result. I remember a pilot saying he was reaching maximum altitude to chase one down and he was stopped in mid air, like frozen. Then the flying saucer just disappeared.</em>
</p>

<p>
	<em>Everyone that's been deep into the mountains here has reportedly seen UFOs of some sort, village people see them all the time. The only story that gives me chills in all honesty is the one about the hemaphrodite alien and the military block-off.</em>
</p>

<p>
	<em>*at this point Zmajevit told him that it was probably a demon*</em>
</p>

<p>
	<em>chills down my spine</em>
</p>

<p>
	<em>Never thought of it like that, but it makes sense now. In the documentary I saw (which fuck I can't find any of cuz it was on TV together with that of the pilots that chased the UFOs, none of it is on the web) there were pictures of the hemaphrodite alien. And nigga, it was disgusting. I'm sleeping with a cross from now on.</em>
</p>

<p>
	What do you think? I WANT TO BELIEVE
</p>

<p>
	(EDIT: did you notice James Mason's alien-metaphor in the Anniversary post? That was epic. :D)

			Hell, this magical mindset/lifestyle could be the very key that’s been missing from modern fascist movements. But in order to actually apply it to ourselves, we have to truly understand and genuinely admit to the full implications and conclusions that this mindset leads to, and then we will be able to actually try to apply and implement them. What do you think?

<p>
	I agree with you here, even if seemingly there is a twist in logic, namely that first we have to accept its implications and only then can we understand and apply the mindset. I presume I know what you meant there; something like we should be open to its applications instead of enforcing our own preconceptions. András László was talking about this too.

Even the author and the book itself are having interesting stories, and its content is even more exciting. It is of course a light novel compared to the Mystery of the Cathedrals, but if you have the time give it a shot.

<p>
	You defined Gothicism nicely, which is my second favorite right after the Romanesque. Iranian architecture looks great too, especially when combined with stained glass windows and Persian carpets like on the first picture you linked. The second made me instantly recall the Ishtar Gate we learned about back in school. I am not so familiar with Art Deco, my modern poison is Art Nouvo, and you already know that I also have some warm feelings towards Soviet architecture or rather that which it could have become (remember Slavros' video on Soviet Gothicism?). I admire the Greco-Roman, and more importantly, the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/WUc0qXD.png" rel="external nofollow">Ancient Egyptian</a> architecture (WHO IS THE KING OF THE MOUNTAINS NOW?) which are probably the closest to the ideal. I was just introduced to the Byzantine style via the Bulgarian guy with alien stories, and for some reason never liked the Hindu one, but (North-)East Asian culture is always approved by me. :D

			Hungarians, Mongols, Turan
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Baranyi wrote an essay on this question pointing out a strong connection between our people. I'll try to sum it up like I did with László's lecture:
</p>

<p>
	1. Originally, the Turanian principle is one of two opposite sides of a greater principle, with the other side being the Iranian one. This also means that it wasn't referring to different races.
</p>

<p>
	2. The Hyperboreans, whose homeland became uninhabitable because of a cataclysm, settled in the region of today's India and Iran. Since the Iranians didn't had to integrate inferior people into their society as it happened in India, they were able to maintain the original Hyperborean culture and thus we could call Ancient Iran the 'New Hyperborea'.
</p>

<p>
	3. According to ancient Iranians the essential thing what made them superior was the possession of something they called 'farr' (coming from the Avestan 'khwarnag'), which could be described as glory brought forth by the Aryan metaphysical knowledge of power/dominance. The word is still used in expressions such as farr-i izadi (glory of God), farr-i ariya'i (glory of Aryans) etc. The distribution of farr was analogous with that of power within the social hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
	4. Baranyi refers to a source here called 'Shahnameh' (looks like a must read for Iranian Nationalists ;)), which defines three type of people from the ancient Central Asia: Iranians, who have the farr, Turanians, who were originally Iranians but lost the farr, and Turks, who never had it. Turanians losing the farr had torn the Iranian Empire in two, with one half remaining settled (Iran) and the other becoming nomad (Turan). From then on, the goal of Turanians was to get back the farr at all costs, similarly to the later quest for the Holy Grail. That lead to conflict.
</p>

<p>
	5. According to Baranyi the Iranian claim of Turanians losing the farr is (surprise-surprise) false, and the two people were different from the beginning, long before the outbreak of the war between them. Of course, later both lost the farr, which turned the settled civilization into Westernism and the nomad civilization into Bolshevism. Here he compares the Iranian story of Iraj and Tur to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel: in the former, the nomad son kills the settled one, while in the latter it's the opposite. And so did it happen, while the settled principle became victorious in the West, the nomadic one dominated the East.
</p>

<p>
	6. Their principles were similar to that of Vishnu and Shiva, as Iranians tried to maintain Tradition while Turanians were destroying its deviations, looking at everything as idolatry. To think of it, I was talking about the unity of the two with other words, as ideal Fascism (Brahma) being the unity of Traditionalism (Vishnu, Iran) and Futurism (Shiva, Turan). Anyway, it's strange that you mentioned Vishnu as the highest God.
</p>

<p>
	7. As Turanians left the territory of Iran they begun living and mixing with other peoples such as Turks and Mongols, and you know the rest of the story. Anyway, the fact that we are settled for more than a 1000 years now is a burden on our nature and would explain the state what we are in today, and maybe the way to break it.
</p>

<p>
	What do you think? Also, I just learned how Mongols enriched the Iranian society too with Hafez living under Mongol monarchs and all. :P But yeah, this Mongol meme isn't to be taken seriously most of the time. It's mainly for reminding ourselves and others from time to time that we are different, like we have an unfinished job or something.

	TOTAL FUTURISM AND SPIRITUAL RECONQUISTA OF THE CARPATHIAN BASIN
</p>

<p>
	Depends on the circumstances, really. For example, according to Baranyi the current Turkish government is quasi-Traditionalist, compared to them the Russians are Liberals. So yes, we could ally with Turkey but would never support or even agree on their neo-Ottoman plans (well, you can ask what kind of alliance would that be). Russia at the moment is barely more than a counter-balance against the West; Eastern Europe alone is weak; Germany becomes a shithole and Catholicism is dying. Turanism should be embraced, not in the sense of going full nomad, but more like a cultural orientation by which we could replace the Western influence.

That much is very true—that different regions/civilizations have their own inner sense of existence, and it’s that inner essence that has to be cultivated in order to achieve the earthly ideal. North America has its own Dasein, China has its Dasein, Iran has its Dasein, Russia has its Dasein, etc. All of that is true of course.
