	Do you guys have a website or anywhere I can learn what you guys are about? Also if I like you guys how would I go about joining? I know I'm in the AV but they're based out west and here in PA were bit having any luck finding guys and I heard you were based in New England so I think being northerners I'd be easier for me to get involved with you guys. <img alt=":silver:" data-emoticon="" src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/default_silver.png" title=":silver:" /></p>
