	I said in the forums "I wasn't kidding when I told you I practice black magic" because something very bad and mean happened to me, done by IM members on Discord. I thought they were going to show what happened in the forums and increase my humiliation, I was livid and sent a warning because I thought they'd see it. It wasn't directed to you or the others though. They did this to the wrong person and they will pay. Even though they apolgized.
