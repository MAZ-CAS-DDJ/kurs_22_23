	You are welcome!
</p>

<p>
	I wanted to ask if you could give me the name of the correct Arabic fonts, because <a href="http://www.designyourway.net/drb/ths/diverse/arabicfonts/andalus.gif?x40569" rel="external nofollow">"Andalus"</a> was the best I could find, and it looks like that's not the same you are using. A design with the map of United North Africa would be nice too, but I don't know which countries should I include, since there are more concepts:
</p>

<p>
	1. The vision of El Maadi was a federation of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia;
</p>

<p>
	2. the region of Maghreb (Arab West) includes the former plus Libya, Mauritania and Western Sahara;
</p>

<p>
	3. the Berber Nationalist concept of Tamazgha includes the former plus Azawad, Northern Niger and the Siwa Oasis of Egypt.
</p>

<p>
	It's sad there is no English translation for the book of Mohamed El Maadi, but I'm sure you know which concept should I use.
</p>

<p>
	The other thing I wanted to know is what is the writing on the flag of Abdelkader?
</p>

	...and I have found a website again, I don't know what to think of it:

	EDIT: Hey, <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/7097-greetings-from-a-temporary-leaf/" rel="">there is a new guy</a> who is half-Algerian and interested in his Algerian heritage. He seems like a good chap.
