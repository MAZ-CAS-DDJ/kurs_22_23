<p>I've given up on most liberals, you can convince them and they seem to forget the next day. They are too entrenched into their delusions, they have grown too fond of the hooks sunk deep into their minds. They will defend those hooks while we try to pull them out for them; why bother then? I'm starting to get a feeling that the whites that are redpilled are redpilled, the ones that cling to their delusions still? They had their chance. </p>
<p>I hope it isnt that way though, we need numbers. </p>

<p>Yeah I hear alot of nationalists say that the Europeans were always manipulated to fight each other by the Jews but I disagree. Our constant fighting is what made us strong because we had to constantly adapt. The Romans got rekt by the Celts and Dacians but they learned; likewise the Germans got rekt by the Romans but over time they learned and copied them as well. The main problem are the World Wars, which were so great and intense that it broke us and allowed the Jews to deepen their influence. </p>

<p>But now the time for infighting is gone, we have learned all we can from fighting each other. Now we must put those lessons to their ultimate purpose and fight against the external enemy. </p>
