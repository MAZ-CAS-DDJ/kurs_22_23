<p>Cool party. I hadn't heard of them before.</p>
<p>My personal belief is that Europe is the front lines for nationalist revolution. It will be very difficult for European Canadians to maintain and forge their identities until their homelands are free. Besides, I have reason to believe that once Europe becomes nationalistic again Canada will shortly follow out of fear of becoming 'American'.</p>
<p>I personally have a few friends who are slated for positions in the Liberal Party of Canada, and most of them simply think of democracy as 'the least bad system'. They're just too polite and naive overall so they work within the constraints given to them. Canada must import brown immigrants, they're told, so they'll try to think of a program to help them to 'integrate' rather than attack the source of the problem. I normally just point out inconsitencies and self-contradictions and play devil's advocate, but I recently got one guy to read 'Democracy Against the Nation' from Codreanu's "For My Legionaries" after I used some of the arguments from that chapter in a recent debate, which he thoroughly enjoyed. Still didn't want to read 100+ pages on the Jewish question though.</p>
<p>Keep fighting the good fight.</p>
