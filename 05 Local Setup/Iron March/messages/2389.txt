<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>I like Strasser. He wrote much of the early ideology before they decided he had become too radical for them.</p>
<p>This forum is also strange. It is full of "Nazis" who have fetishes of Naziism. They are not pragmatic at all, and of course, mostly American.</p>
<p>I will probably post, but I do not like the idea of having to educate supposed "National Socialists" on what National Socialism actually stood for.</p>
<p>Nazis did not become popular because they hated Jews. And it seems pointless to give a history about this on a forum of people who are supposedly Nazis.</p>
<p>I would do it though if only to expose the fact that people here who think they are National Socialists are really American neo nazi with a view of National Socialism coming from media, TV, and video games instead of things like <em>Mein Kampf</em>, <em>Triumph des Willens</em>, or <em>Wirtschaftliches Sofortprogramm der NSDAP.</em></p>
<p>I like Israel, and I don't see a problem with it. People say the Israelis steal Palestinian land.</p>
<p>Well, Russians stole German land, Americans stole Indian land, English took over Ireland, and Palestinians have never had a country anyway (before the British, the Ottomans ruled them).</p>
<p>But I find it amusing that the same people that hate liberalism often support the liberalism that is anti Israel.</p>
<p>For the Holocaust, I think many stories are probably exaggerated. Most eyewitness accounts talk of Jews being sent on trains to the East and then shot and put in pits. But not gassed. (Much of this was done without Hitler's knowledge. Hitler approved of them being sent East, but he did not want them killed).</p>
<p>Obviously something happened though. The Jewish population of Germany and Poland shrunk.</p>
<p>I think 6 million is bad, but it is not so bad. Stalin killed many times this number, but liberal Jews today monopolize WWII to say they were the only or primary victims.</p>
<p>I am not sure I agree with this, however I understand they did it to gain support for a Jewish State (which ultimately has become non-Jewish, causing radical Jews to want to secede from Israel and create Judea). So, though it is somewhat unfair to everyone who suffered, they are being smart.</p>
<p>What can I read regarding Prussian Socialism? What literature supported your thought?</p>
