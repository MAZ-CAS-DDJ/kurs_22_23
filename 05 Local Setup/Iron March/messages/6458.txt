<p>Cheers, I'll take a look at those. Also, do you know where I can get a copy of 'Against the Modern World' by Mark Sedgwick?</p>

<p>I expected the reaction to be as much from the forum. I do have a libertarian bias, but I think that totalitarianism is probably the only way to go. It's probably true that I am not a 'fascist' as such, but I thought that these forums were the best place to find some like minded people. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyways, I'll keep in touch, have a read of those, and hopefully learn how to fit in.</p>
