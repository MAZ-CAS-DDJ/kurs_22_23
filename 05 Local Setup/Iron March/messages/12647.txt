<p>... This is why I neither like the concept of university for all, nor the valuing of academics over the working classes. A physics teacher of mine once told the class that meteorology was the study of meteors. You could look into online courses.</p>
<p>Oh dear. Do you have brown recluses too? Definitely. The ethnic picture of the Middle East consists of more than just Arabs, and considering many places now Arab-inhabited weren't to begin with...</p>
<p>Interesting! I'm trying my hand at a kitchen garden right now, so (fingers crossed) that'll succeed. When do you plan to start with the farming? If livestock is involved, it's going to be a big venture.</p>
<p>Hopefully you won't have to wait many more years for the race war, but the situation in the U.S. doesn't look as straightforward. What do you think?</p>
<p>If the issues were bad enough that you felt you had to move, then I'm terribly sorry. Hope they're ones that can be sorted out eventually.</p>
<p>Chaos magic is a good semi-scientific framework for studying the occult, imo, but it's rather opportunistic at the same time.</p>
<p>Dark blue eyes? Nice! Mine are hazel. And illustration as well as carving? You're a very artsy person indeed! Planning on doing anything job-related with your art skills?</p>
<p>I'm in the process of joining NA, but it's hard to sneak out for a meeting, with the state of my schedule at the moment, so if I'm rejected for not being committed enough... How about you? Do you know any fascists in person?</p>
<p>I didn't use to live in the Midwest, but I do have family there, so I'm in Chicago at least once a year. Do you go abroad much?</p>
