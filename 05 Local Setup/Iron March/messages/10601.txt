<p>I don't know. I was looking through some threads and found one that interests me. Comment and then all hell breaks. Just because I comment doesn't mean just invade the thread. I want my 2 cents there and not ambushed. Just because I talked about sex doesn't mean it's ok to call me a slut nor does it represent any intelligence in him. I replied saying that why is it ok for him to add that comment yet my answer/opinion is "worthless". </p>

<p>One member (forget his name) got all pissy because of the way I talked about sluts and virginity. <br /><br />Some common sense is nice. Thank you. </p>
