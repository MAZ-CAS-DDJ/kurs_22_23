	My midterms are this week, I've been stressing as well haha. Yes, I celebrate pretty much all the pagan high festivals. Oftentimes I can't do a whole lot though since it relies on communal offerings for some events. I do what I can. Thanks, he does essentially sum up my feelings about the migrant crisis in germany. It's a nice picture of her too, she was a pretty girl. Need to read more on her, I mostly know about oswald.

	I'm only putting trust him for the sake of laughs and spiting leftists, I'm sure he will go against some of his promises.  He wouldn't have gotten this far without a dirty deal somewhere. Yeah I have interesting dreams lol. I only remember a few in detail. I've had lots of experiences where my mind is sorta half asleep and half awake and things spill into my mind while I'm concious. Usually it's just weird nonsense that only makes sense in dreamstate, I remember once haggling over ice cubes with a fruit vendor. I'm sorry your mom and brother deal with it too. Mine are pretty bad but I guess I've gotten used to them, I've learned to banish them now. Been having it since I was 11. Usually the demons look like that, just vaguely human masses of shadow. I've only seen a few with defined shapes and colors, and they're often friendly or passive even if they appear grotesque or demonic, there was one who stretched up to the ceiling, had no legs and only a spine, 4 atrophied arms and a fleshy hood covering it's head. Just stood in the room staring at me. Spirit world is pretty weird lol

	Forests and mountains are my favorite enviroments, along with coasts. Have you ever seen the redwood forests? It's my favorite place in america most likely. LA people I suppose. Somehow even well off white people become uptight arrogant assholes just by osmosis of living here. In rural aread people are more friendly at least. My immediate neighbors are hunter redneck folk and they're very kind,  always invite me to eat elk or pheasant for dinmer. I haven't heard about that, but I'm not surprised. I don't even want to know what they're doing to American education now but I'm sure it's awful judging the way kids are. There's 10 year Olds going around saying they're polyamorous demisexual lesbians or whatever on vines.

	Well he missed out, I'm good at slogans almost as much as commies. I was a big fan of the german monarchy for a while but I'm a fan of anything germanic. I could see that, it is sort of similiar in structure. People think a tiered society is just wrong but it's the way nature works. People naturally have different skillsets. The rigsthula  in the Eddas makes a good point of this from a nordic perspective

	Any luck meeting other  fascists? How did you first become fascist? Sorry if I keep asking your life story, you're interesting to me. I have much to report to my zionist overlords :^) also why did you pick unity mitford? she a personal idol of yours? I have  many people i look up to but the main one is the guy my account is named after.
