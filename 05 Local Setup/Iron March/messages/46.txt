<p>This journal (about 25 pages) provides a good amount of information on the corporatist idea in the first pages.  I am reading it because of my interest in China, but I haven't gotten far enough to tell you what it says about it's China.  I know that fascists have some interest in Corporatism so I thought they might find it interesting.</p>
