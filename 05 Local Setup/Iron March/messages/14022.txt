	You're far too pure for this world. I'm leaving it to fate atm, but if I find a nice girl I'll try to woo her. I suppose you can take my advice about leaving it to fate with a grain of salt though, since I don't currently have a gf. Have had some before at least. Being outgoing helps. Basically just becoming the ideal fascist will have to net you a girl, since all girls deep down crave it.

	&gt;90% of the time people have no idea what I am talking about

	Yeah it's hard to find people who chat about the same shit, girls especially. Small talk is pretty much the only way to keep a conversation with them

	&gt;you probably think I am pathetic don't you?
</p>

<p>
	Nope. Being a fascist puts you in the right direction. You'd only be pathetic if you dealt with your circumstances by becoming one of those MGTOW faggots or some liberal cuck.
