<p>Hello slavros, I wanted to ask you about the knights Templars. I know you've said they were sort of "fascist before fascism" along with the alchemists. What I'm curious about is why the free masons decided to make a subgroup called the knights templar, and your views on this. The German national socialists were anti freemason, so basically I'm wondering why a hostile group claims to be associated with a group you claim is fascist in a way. Hope to hear back from you soon, and thanks for the reply in advance. </p>
