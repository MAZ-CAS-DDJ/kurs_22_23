<p>Why would you describe Occidentalism (or the Western Imperium idea) as a "liberal-christian-zionist" thing?  I mean, I'll give you Christian, but I am pretty sure the Western Imperium has been advocated by NSers.  They cast a wider racial net than traditional NSism, but that seems to be something that doesn't bother you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I agree your assessment of America.  She lies at the foundation of the current world order and her rulers have everything to lose from altering the order of things in the world.  American fascists must choose between their nation (if there is such a thing as an "American nation") and their country.  It is a sad state of affairs.</p>

<p>And between empire and little nations, we could imagine some cultural contract amoung little states.</p>
<p>Empire would have some kingly power : foreign affairs, internal diplomacy, army, the coordination of the socialist economy (exchange between litle states about energy for example), maintain the integrity of the Empire, ethnical problems, and an influence in culture and politics but not more.</p>
<p>After we would articulate all this level with the subsidiarity princip, with a relative auto self direction for neighborhood and factory, then for the city, etc. A system of russian doll.</p>

<p>Very cool.  Are you familiar with Distributism?  It sounds similar to this system.</p>

<p>Would you mind explaining aryan spirituality?  I am unfamiliar with that term.  Also, would you mind explaining your personal spirituality?  Pagans always interest me. </p>

(yes,a little with pleasure)<p>We have no state until we always have "historical states", but the wheel of time turn.

<p>That is awesome!  Did you learn Breton in your family or did you have to go out and learn it?  Are Breton, French, and English the only languages you are familiar with?</p>
<p>That is interesting.  Would you be willing to accept autonomy as a compromise or are you dead-set on a resurrection of the Breton state within the framework of a Federal Europe?</p>
<p>Alas, I live the godhead of liberal depravity that is America.  I consider myself a German, but I have a healthy love for the region my family inhabits (Indiana if you are familiar with US geography).  I've heard there were movements such as the Vinlandic Heathen Front that are interested in creating a Germanic culture in the US.  I sympathize with these people, but I've never had much faith in "created societies."  That being said, Zionism pulled it off.  Maybe there is hope for America.</p>
