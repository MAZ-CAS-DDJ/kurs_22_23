All doctrines are going to have their flaws, but from what I'm garnering from this website, Fascism seems a little strong, no? I like the idea about being a zelot for traditionalism, but I don't know about it's anti-democratic stance. How long have you been on this site, and what have you witnessed thus far? Also, is that your general opinion about this site, or do you like it?</div></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I agree the available ideologies are limited, draw my personal views from many sources, Fascism included. Me and my friend here Stoic Guardian (who got permabanned here) know eachother from another forum called Nationstates, where we both participate on the debate board of that site.</p>
<p>We have a group of friends there we exchange thoughts with, we've become a think tank of sorts. Most of us are former Fascists, Socialists with Fascist sympathies, or Corporatists.</p>
<p>And to answer you question, I've known these people for about 3 years. If you look on here for a member under the name Crimson_Fasces, that's me. I got banned because apparently no being a race fetishist and disagreeing with these degenerates is "sperging". It didn't help that I'm not white. I re-registered incognito in order to simply monitor their behavior and tendencies. I was also a member of this site's predecessor the "international third positionist federation" which was a superior forum to this one, it wasn't filled to the brim with degenerates.</p>
