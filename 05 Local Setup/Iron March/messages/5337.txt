<p>As I unfortunately suspected. I will tomorrow from work. Have you ever done any WordPress blogging, regardless of the subject matter?  If you have, any tips, particularly regarding profile/blog elevation and tags would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>On the matter of the NBU, new member Servern (sp?) in the intros referenced them (and Mosley) if you have not seen.  It led to very mild negative comments about the NBU, but not Mosley. I thought I would throw in an equally mild positive comment for the NBU saying give it time and who else is really looking out for the true tenants of fascism in the UK in 2013?  I got a comeback from the SuspiciousCeleryStalk or whatever the name is.</p>
