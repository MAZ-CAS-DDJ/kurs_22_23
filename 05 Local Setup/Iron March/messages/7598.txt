<p>That particular chapter was written by one Ereole Quadrelli and reworked by Evola under the pseudonym Abraxas (same goes for all names under that pseudonym).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And the entire group practiced certain rituals and there's explanations of those in the book.  No way of telling if Evola actually did any of these but i'm inclined to believe that he did.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The chapter has a lot of stuff that mimics what Evola wrote in the Hermetic Tradition, which also mentions the practice of the Mirror. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, personally, I had no issues with anything in the book, while certain parts may seem suspect by large it defines magic as more so a science of the metaphysical world, since profane science by its very nature cannot touch on the metaphysical. If you approach the matter in a more detached spirit like a researcher it may be far less creepy, since the books gives instructions we tend to immediately imagine having to do them and it may be what drives one away, once you first take a look at it as something detached from you, you may be more at ease with it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Naturally the subject matter is such that we, with our purely materialistic, samsaric experience of live, would find at least something in this disconcerting. At the same time we as Fascists lean towards what is known as the Left Hand path, which actually implies indulging in the vices of samsaric life in order to overcome them, as opposed to the Right Hand path that implies searching for that inner strength to reject samsaric life entirely. Each have their own dangers, but since we're more closely rooted to the Left Hand Path the Right Hand Path may seem unpleasant, and that chapter does deal more so with the Right Hand Path methodology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another way to think about it is that this is in reality same stuff that original Buddhists practiced (and pali-buddhism is a Right Hand Path methodology), since that's a more familiar concept at least in name it may be easier to process the chapter as something not as alien.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some knowledge/experience/observations from life helps as well, for instance the introduction of the Mirror: "The Mirror technique acts on the optical nerve and fatigues it, until the power concentrated in the act of staring is freed from the physical organ and actualized in the fluidic light." When I read this some experiences came to my mind where I'd stare into some blank spot, rather than a mirror, but due to certain lighting it would fatigue the eye to a point where I would perceive everything to grow darker continuously even though it obviously never happened, so it has to do with what would be otherwise called an optical illusion, though that would be just something to say in order to disregard the effect. Having some jackboot shaman training now under my belt I can see how visuals and the affects on the eye can be of importance to practices as described in the book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So all in all I'm inclined to believe there's something to these practices, but its hard to really determine how much because the entire thing to begin with seems to be either trial and error or based in one's "will", certainly uncomfortable ground if you want to be materialistically scientific about it, but you can still apply the same critical thinking to it while accepting its rules to see where that takes you. Not to mention that it's made clear that such practices are most commonly something like amplifiers or short-cuts and are not always recommended, in many cases these practices can be just an attempt at visually symbolizing a completely internal process ergo why it seems ridiculous as we may expect these elements to have power in of themselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My point would be this I suppose: treat it as a science but follow its rules. You can still criticize it and it may not all be legitimate (there were many people contributing to this and their full intentions and understanding of the subject matter is not so well known to us as Evola's although he clearly supervised the project and worked on many articles or approved of them - I suggest you read the editor's notes from page xxiv and onwards to work out which pseudonyms belong to whom so you understand better the relations between the articles, or I can send you the one I had constructed before I started reading the book proper myself), but there is still certainly something that it is based on that is rooted in a valid source.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Personally, I was rather disturbed by a different chapter "On the Counter-Initiation", it's said that it is not clear if Evola had anything to do with that chapter, as the Arvo pseudonym could belong either to him or one Duke Giovanni, but after having read it first, and then finding out who Duke Giovanni was, I immediately lost any tension about the subject matter and definitively concluded that Evola had nothing to do with that chapter. Givovanni was a leftist and introduced leftist notions into the issue and brought about the idea of a concious evil force, now that was a creepy notion, but tottally against what Evola always wrote on how such powers are impersonal and how good and evil are ridiculous notions to begin with, used with morality to create an outside point of reference for spineless people who have no internal core.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hope this alleviates any concerns regarding the subject matter and its presentation.</p>
