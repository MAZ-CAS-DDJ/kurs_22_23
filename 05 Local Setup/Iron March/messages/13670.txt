	So, since the perceived collapse of Atomwaffen, there has been dilemma about transferring. Both Silver Legion and Reaction are promising candidates, but I was told that you two are trying to figure out a different branch. I would think, however, that a national influence seperated into MANY regions is more powerful than a regional influence by itself. It is with this that I am strongly against the proposal of making a different  group, we as a community need to connect with each other more, anyways. Let me know what you guys think, but I think that setting up operations with Reaction is the way to go. They don't have many people In the east, yet, and they need some more coverage.
