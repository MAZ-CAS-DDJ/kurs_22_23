	Well when I started here many years ago I was far worse off than you, it's just that at the time it was really moderate, in so far as believing fascism and national socialism were two different things and that racism wasn't important. Things have changed a lot around here as our understanding of the eternal truth has progressed.<br /><br />
	There's a reason why we offer this material to those who want it, I'm glad to hear it's making an impact on you, I just wish guys from Daily Stormer and shit were in the same boat.<br /><br />
	In regards to this being a honey pot, we try out best to keep feds out with our dickish and rigorous vetting. I don't doubt they watch the site, but it's a risk we have to be willing to take if we're truly national socialists. We can not have fear of the consequences for fighting for the eternal truth, and eventually establishing the organic state. It's good to be paranoid about new comers and others when meeting in person, but you can't let it stop you from building the future, don't be people like /pol/ who are too paranoid to accomplish anything.
