	Hey Alex. Wanted to speak with you before I post anything. <br />
	It's the first time we are mentioned in official press. Our mates have been apologetic and shit. It's really cringy. me as myself wasn't mentioned in that article. My retoric was really strong and defining the true reason and why we did it and shit. That stuff really grinds my gears. <a href="http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/law/kauno-tautininkai-nutare-sugadinti-vakareli-svencianciai-europai-primine-hitleri-ir-svastikas.d?id=72986038&amp;com=1&amp;reg=0&amp;no=0&amp;s=2" rel="external nofollow">http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/law/kauno-tautininkai-nutare-sugadinti-vakareli-svencianciai-europai-primine-hitleri-ir-svastikas.d?id=72986038&amp;com=1&amp;reg=0&amp;no=0&amp;s=2</a><br /><br />
	That's the article. It's In Lithuanian. Where I should post this for the most reach and all. Because 3 of our dudes got fines for 150Eu each, and maybe I will get that too, it's not clear untill december second. (But if I would get that fine, I'm covered). It would be nice to receive donations not specifically from you, but to allow people to know, that we need help.<br /><br />
	So, what would you suggest to do?
