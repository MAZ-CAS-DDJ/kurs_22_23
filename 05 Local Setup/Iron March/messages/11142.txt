<p>If you feel comfortable responding to any of this, please do so. I'm SOL right now and I think I'm about to snap.</p>
<p>I went to PT, in uniform, got yelled at because I wasn't supposed to.</p>
<p>but they told me I was supposed to earlier. The whole struggle was two weeks ago when they told me to not to come back to PT unless I was wearing the uniform... except nobody was wearing their uniform today and nobody told me about the new "winter regulations" about gym workouts.</p>
<p>Squad leader got yelled at because we've gone through 3 squad leaders in the last week and he didn't personally introduce himself. I got singled out with the squad leader. We both got disciplined. I got told to go shirtless since i wasn't going to wear the uniform</p>
<p>told I was dishonoring the entire army. Lieutenant Good went and got me a shirt from the CORE office because I should wear a shirt. I got yelled at again because I didn't follow specific instructions</p>
<p>I covered for Good by not saying she got me the shirt</p>
<p>Got taken outside, screamed at. got the squad leader in more trouble</p>
<p>They had a formation, told the entire squad that they were "failing to motivate squad members to do their jobs"</p>
<p>I was told to leave PT. as I'm walking to my car, the Major tells me to get my ass back inside. somebody else gets yelled at for telling me to leave. After PT the squad leader, Second Lieutenant, and anyone in the squad who smokes takes me outside. they tell me to hold my arm out</p>
<p>and they all extinguish their cigarettes on my arm and spit on it after.</p>
<p>Basically my arm is fucking skinned, I tried to wear a jacket to cover it and my skin stuck to the jacket, I took it off and more ripped out, most of my arm is red and bloody, I wrapped it in toilet paper from the bathroom, taped over it and am wearing my jacket over it. There's still skin that's stuck onto my jacket. They told me that if I rat, they're going to be on my ass. The entire brigade will be on my ass.</p>
<p>I want to go in and I want to find them and I want to pull my razor out and just slit their fucking throats wide open and fuck the openings right there where they are. I want to go and make a scene and I fucking can't. </p>
<p>My mother is inevitably going to find out and the only thing I'll be able to do is either tell her the truth, get the entire brigade in trouble and probably get discontinued or have these guys possibly get discharged, which will have everyone at my throat, or say I just took matches to my own arm like an edgy faggot.</p>
<p>I really don't know what to do. I honestly feel like any group I've ever been in I've always gotten singled out. I've always made mistakes and when I make mistakes I make more because the pressure is on. The only group I've ever not gotten singled out in is when I was leading the Edinboro Chapter.</p>
