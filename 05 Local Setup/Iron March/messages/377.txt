<p>Dux,</p>
<p>It's alright, I understand the delay. I have been away from the forums for a few days myself. I am actually in the process of enlisting in the Army so my involvement now, it would appear, will be limited. However, I should not leave for basic training until summer so I should at least be here for a few more months. To my knowledge, that will make three American military members on this forum.</p>
<p>I agree we need to mobilize the American elements on this board. This place is practically little Russia at times haha. We should definitely try to push for more involvement in our sub-forum and create a networking system for all of us. We have some great American users such as yourself, UltraNationalist, Ferret, American_Blackshirt and others. I think we could really make some good ideological headway if we worked in a group effort.</p>
<p>I agree with the think tank idea, I believe it is the most viable solution. I was an admin on a WN IRC server a long time ago, so I am pretty familiar with using it. I think it is a great idea and a good medium to utilize. Let me know if there is anyway I can help in setting it up or with running it.</p>
<p>Keep in touch,</p>
<p>William</p>
