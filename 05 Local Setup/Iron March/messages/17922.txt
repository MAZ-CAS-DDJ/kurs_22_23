	Alright, I'll take your word as a man and a comrade. Essentially, we've been quietly networking within AV to find the best of the best. Real dedicated guys as opposed to the "paleoconservative" types. Trust me, we hate them just as much as you guys do.Â

	We started a smaller off-shoot called the Aryan Underground, gonna have some "old school" aesthetics. Whatever. It's mostly all AV guys currently but we're just ensuring that we can have a smooth transition. We don't want to start shit over this but it'll probably be inevitable.

	In case anything does happen to me please let someone who could do something know. If not, we plan on doing some flyering and get some headlines soon to establish ourselves.
