	Oh yes the Australian Action posters in that thread. I completely forgot about that. It's possible that a few of the people are not on IronMarch though. I'll email the people who left their emails in the thread about a possible meetup.<br /><br />
	Yeah you're right that we should wait but I think most won't bite since they'll just think I'm ASIO with so little rep. <br /><br />
	Also god damn we need an artfag to make the Eureka Swastika stars uniform in those posters, it tickles my 'tism too much. They gotta be the same colour and same size god damn it.
