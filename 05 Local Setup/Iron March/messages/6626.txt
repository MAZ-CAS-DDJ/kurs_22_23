<p>Hey,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Noticed you put about our debate being painful to watch/read. Just would like to ask for what reasons? Since my knowledge is somewhat limited and all of that debate was from the top of my head and his was from google, i'd like to know (if making incorrect points) please correct me on them, can't be arguing about fascism/national socialism if the points I am making are incorrect. I considered it being the fact we were debating on an introduction, if it is this I apologise.</p>
<p> </p>
