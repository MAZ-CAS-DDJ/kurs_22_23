	Greetings!
</p>

<p>
	I am Lucius, and I recently registered in this forum with the hope of bringing more people to a community of fellow National Socialists across the world. Our community is called ''Fuerza Nueva'' and we conform a relatively new group, with people from Italy, Sweden, Spain and UK in it.<br /><br />
	In fact, a member of "Swedish Democrats" (a nationalistic political party from Sweden) is present in our community.<br /><br />
	We'd like to invite you to join us. Thanks in advance, and have a good day!
