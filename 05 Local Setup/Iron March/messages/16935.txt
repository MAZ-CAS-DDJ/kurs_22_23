	Damn I thought all of the old-schoolers are from my generation. I like that era because back then games were games; not some fucking virtual reality for miserable people to dwell in, but 1 or 2 hours of fun and especially in the case of Thief, also an inspiration which directed my interest towards Medievalism, Christianity, Mysticism and thus indirectly to the Holy Tradition. Games are really a form of propaganda, this became more evident since the Gamergate rumpus.

	Although I can thank a lot to Thief, but I never tried to find out who is the mastermind behind it. Is there a chance you know something about this? Possibly an interview with the guy who came up with the idea of the factions and the lore in general?

	Baldur's Gate and Planescape are two games I am planning to play since a long time, but nowadays I am using my computer only for working. Ashes to ashes, dust to RUST. Karras rules. :D

	One more thing: always edit and extend your posts instead of multiposting. It's not a big problem here in a PM but it makes everybody go full BERZERK in the public threads.
