	there wasnt because everything there was and is bulgarian people and they spoke and followed Bulgarian/bulgarian church. It is after that, when you forced them to be serbians because "muh majku russia said so"
</p>

<p>
	I don't like Turks, but those Turks actually are either gypsies or think of themselves are Bulgarians. They love bulgaria for the most part.

<p>
	Serbia and Russia have always hated Bulgaria and still do, more than Turkey. You do realize that serbians made Macedonia before communism? When you had those royals that paraded around sofia as if they owned it, remember?  (same sit happened when Tito paraded sofia)

	I dont like nato or Eu but it is better than russia. They have done more good to us than bad, which cannot be said for serbo-russia, even BEFORE we liberated <strong>ourselves,</strong> Russia has been trying to shrink bulgaria of our very small and unjust land while pumping money into serbia's empire, which occupied bulgarian built cities.

	Later, the russians did not infest you with dirty communism, you barely had it. "socialists" my ass, you were able to freely leave the country and travel even to the usa, while we were killed and slaughtered for liking Bulgarian identity, and only the elitest of the elite russophiles were allowed to go there. 
</p>

<p>
	Not to mention the tons of history that russia has changed and ruined. They barely know their history because of how much they hate us...  and we cannot properly prove what we know
</p>

<p>
	anyways i dont want to cause fights between fellow balkans (lol)...I just want a unified bulgaria and us being given credit for what is needed.
