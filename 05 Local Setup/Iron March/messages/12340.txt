<p>I'd of thought you'd be unwelcome here due to all the white supremacists (unless you actually believe you are an inferior race which seems counterproductive). Surely, if you don't mind my fowardness, it is... strange, in a sense, to promote Nazism despite the fact Nazism in all its strains normally advocates racial purity, and you would considered racially "impure" (having hispanic, african and asian roots all at once). Don't get me wrong, I'm not against you, but it seems Nazism would be. Could you give me some insight into this issue?</p>

<p>Sorry if I'm sounding like an asshole, but I'm just trying to get an idea of how you could incorporate a fascist worldview despite being of mixed race background.</p>
