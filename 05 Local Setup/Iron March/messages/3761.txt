<p>BTW, i also talked to the head of Philippine Phalange, he is also the leader on the FB page.</p>
<p>1. I do agree, i do think that Iran will finish the Saud dynasty and even better, at the same time, the kikes as well, i'm crossing my fingers for the Iranians to be the true masters of West Asia. Not the yanks, kikes, nor certainly the Sauds, but the Iranians.</p>
<p>2. Exactly, IM is supposed to be superior over scumfront/fuckguardnn AND redleft (no chimpouts), yet, IM, despite it's claims, is being overrun by White Zionists/Zionists on the inside. True, spermfags do hate the kikes "hurr durr we haet israel, but whites r masterz!111!", but what are they doing, they're acting the ways that they claim to despise. Talmud says "We kikes r masters, goyim baadd!", this does not mean goyim = aryan, (because you can find goyim and aryan in basically any nation, although it is mostly minority.) It's just being under the kikes. In your case, it almost has the same analogy with Russians in your country. "Hurr durr we Russians want our cities in Crimea/Baltics back11". They don't even assimilate, as you claim, although it's better they go back.</p>

<p>I have both relatives who participated in the Ukrainian War of Independence which lasted from 1917 to 1921 and who took part in WW2- and post-WW2 anti-communist resistance. My family has quite a high death toll actually. My maternal grandmother and her siblings grew up basically without any male relatives - all of them had either died in combat, were imprisoned or deported to never be heard of again.</p>
<p>How about your ancestors? I don't know much about Filipino history, but as far as I got, the Phillipines went through a tough time more than once. Did relatives of you participate in WW2? Or the wars against the Yanks and Spain?</p>
