	I got a few hours free time in the past 2 days so I read 'The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea'. It was a good read, well written but I found it pretty disturbing. Mishima was obviously very perceptive to be able to write a book like it. Very good story but certainly not something to look up to.
