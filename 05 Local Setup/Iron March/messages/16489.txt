	Hello, I am searching for genuine American Nationalists (excluding National Socialists and White Nationalists) over the Internet to befriend because I don't know anyone in person who shares my political beliefs. I had joined this forum for the same reason you did. Based on your introduction, I feel that we may share similar views. Do you use Skype, Steam, or any other instant messaging program? By the way, I visited your YouTube page. I enjoyed watching your videos.
