	No problem at all! Hope you are well.<br /><br />
	Say, you wouldn't happen to have a Skype, would you? Many of the members here have one, so if you ever want to talk to members more freely without having to worry about all the rules of posting, you should make one.<br /><br />
	You can usually find out someone's Skype by looking at their profile here. In their information.<br /><br />
	There's also an IM Skype group, but you may want to wait a while before joining (you have to be added in by someone already in it). The Skype group is quite a bit more tight-knit than the forum, so you need to establish yourself a bit first.<br /><br />
	Go ahead and add anyone you want, though.
