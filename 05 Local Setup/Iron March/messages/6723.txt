<p>I believe in a hierarchy. Aryan men are at the top of that hierarchy. They rule all things, especially women. Women no matter the race inherently inferior to men. I am meant to serve and obey my Aryan brothers. I feel most happy when I am kneeling, obedient, radiating in their power and strength.</p>
