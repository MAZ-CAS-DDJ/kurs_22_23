			I know, and it is truly great if somebody is strong enough to sacrifice himself for his nation and religion, but we both know that most of these people don't know much about those subjects. Hell, even though I try to improve my understanding on Theology almost every week I am far from saying I understand it, and I don't have time to read the great Hungarian poets for example. I respect the warriors you are talking about, but most of them was always following cultural codes. They are doing things because they were told to do so, because they were raised like that, not because of true confidence. It's still a virtue, but not the highest.

	Tbh, each one of them knows basics. God exists and he is on our side. Some of the simples concepts there are.

			Between 1941 and 1945 they did. Well, it was mainly the Soviets, but Romanians were eager to help them after their treachery against their former allies. We also have millions of sins to remember from the Communist era, or '56, but that won't turn me against the Russian, the Romanian or the Slovakian nation, even if the average soldier of their armies butchered our men and raped our women with joy - because I know about a lot of similar stories in which our soldiers were the perpetrators. This is how Lemmings work in the army, propaganda turns them into wild beasts. Heck, we even had a Hungarian Communist who fled from Hungary to Moscow and wrote poems for the Soviets in which he called for our extermination because we fought for Hitler.

			Today Russians really don't care about us, and that's how most of the Croatians feel towards Serbs now. The NATO got what they wanted already - and that wasn't a weak, divided Serbia, but a weak, divided region.

	Well this was done by Croat nation, not members of a cult such as Soviets. <br />
	Region will stay weak until it unites. It's funny how NATO took strikes only at Serbs, not at Croats or Muslims.
