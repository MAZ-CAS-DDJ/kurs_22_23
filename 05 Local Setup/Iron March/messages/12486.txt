<p> The truth is, I find it actually pretty sad that a good amount of the youth national socialists are becoming National Socialists because Liberal/marxism is the mainstream. It is a revolt against the modern world, but it's the same principle as rebelling against one's society and <em>that</em> is why it's appealing to so many kids. </p>
