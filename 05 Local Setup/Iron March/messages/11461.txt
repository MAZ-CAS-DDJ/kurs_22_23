<p>I will soon be posting pictures of stickers I have placed around town. But I wanted to ask for some advice and you are properly the most experienced.</p>
<p>To upload them to the forum I need to upload them to a image hosting site (As far as I remember). But are there any you could recommend?</p>
<p>Also: Do I need to do any manipulation with the pictures. The pictures will only feature the sticker and no people. But do I have to do any tampering with them anyway and how?</p>
<p>Hope you can help.</p>
