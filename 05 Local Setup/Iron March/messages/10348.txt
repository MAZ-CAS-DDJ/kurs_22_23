Not good but the alternative would be to just slowly let the civilization die out. But hey, we'll see how things turn out exactly. We live in a interesting time, when shit hits the fan we'll probably be around 35-ish so we've been gifted with an oppertunity we simply can't ignore.</p>

<p>And yeah, pretty much the same for me. I got 2 Fs (or rather, ''blanks'') due to low attendence in the Swedish ''high school'' (gymnasium) that I have to finnish up before it's time to move on to whatever.</p>

<p>I don't think anyone think ''take meth and sk0l shot evry dai'' (and if they do they have issues we can't help them with other than to leave them alone) should be taken seriously tho. But hey, nice having you back. You finnished that book I sent you that I got from zieger btw?</p>
