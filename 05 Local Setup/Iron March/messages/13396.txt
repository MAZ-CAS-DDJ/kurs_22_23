	Think of it as part Campout, part Historic Convention, Part Fighting event.<br /><br />
	They're incredibly strict about what time periods you can emulate and *how* you emulate them, but you'll have people emulating different reenactment styles from the dark ages towards *pre*-renaissance. There are "pirate" people that nobody like and are kinda frowned upon, since most of us take it seriously.Â <br /><br />
	But pretty much everything is emulated properly *based on what history and culture we know*, right down to my armor xD.<br /><br />
	But just being able to go to the tournaments, which are separate from the field battles and actually happen all year long will be fun since the the only time I get to focus on them is the summer.
