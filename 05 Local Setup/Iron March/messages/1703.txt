<p>Hey,</p>
<p>There aren't many right-leaning sites in English that I like, so I can't help much there. I mostly stick to old books. I do like Alain de Benoist's journals, but they're in French.</p>
<p>As for internet forums, I recommend Salo Forum. I post there occasionally and you seem like you'd fit in much better there. The posters are much less anti-intellectual than the ones on Iron March. They won't scoff at you for discussing philosophy, high culture, etc. </p>

<p>We're trying to attract more people, so if you know anyone else from Iron March who:</p>
<p>1) is intelligent, and likes to discussing philosophy, the arts, current events, etc.</p>
<p>2) isn't a WN dickhead</p>
<p>Feel free to refer them there as well.</p>
