<p> </p>
<p>I haven't been on this forum for very long, but it's full of children, cyber-fetishists, and 'hollywood nazis'. I don't know if anything can be made of them. I may well be limiting my involvement here if it becomes clear im wasting my time; they want to be an online 'club' not the nucleus of an international movement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A man in the right knows what to do and how to do it in his life and in his life alone anyway, when it comes down to it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Peace,</p>
