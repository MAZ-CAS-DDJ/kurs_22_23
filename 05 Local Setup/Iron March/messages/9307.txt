<p>Jack London is great, I read the crap out of <em>Call of the Wild</em> back in elementary school. What you could get for it depends on the condition, edition, etc. But I would estimate between $40 and $60.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've wanted to get that book, is it any good? I was worried about it having an overly modern perspective on a man few moderns could understand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In everything I try to emulate The Prophet. He embraced decadence without degeneration, individualism without nihilism, hedonism without rejecting the spirt. Passion in all things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don't have any of his novels except The Child of Pleasure in pdf. Here it is.</p>

<p>I have read lots of his poetry, my mother has a nice old book of it. Do you like poetry?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know the feeling of having to justify a purchase, my mother's eyebrows raised when I recieved Evola's <em>Metaphysics of Sex</em>, and <em>Mein Kampf</em> rose them even higher. But that sounds like a fun cover. I've been fascinated by corsets ever since I saw Sophia Loren in <em>The Millionairess</em> (I was nine I think?). I think they are rather ridiculously alluring. Once I was running the shop by myself and a girl asked me to help her try on one of the corsets; that was probably one of the most... um... interesting things I've done <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_laugh.png" alt=":lol:" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yep, my work is fun!</p>
