	Bars and shakes can be alright, just depends on what's in them. Can be better to make your own things like that given they're expensive. I'll have a protein shake after a gym workout sometimes though.

	If you've started to lose weight that's good. Keep in mind if you're building muscle you'll lose weight a bit more slowly but you'll be dropping fat all the same, just putting muscle on as well.
