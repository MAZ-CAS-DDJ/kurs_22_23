<p>They aren't the only bad ones, don't forget the Vangaurd and AutNatUSA fellers. I'm a employer in a midsize successful business. Got a BA in Economics when I was a youngster, learned how the economy and human really works and made my money that way. I came to Fascist Capitalism after spending a while as your run of the mill Neo-Conservative turned Paleoconservative Libertarian. I also studied Ms. Rand quite a bit myself <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> really smart gal she was. When I was in college I was fascinated by Mussolini and the Fascist fight against Communism, and after I learned Libertarianism couldn't work because people are too stupid to follow all the rules to keep a free economy together I knew that a Fascist Government is the only way to keep Capitalism together.</p>
<p>Fascist Capitalist figures to study in detail are Franco &amp; Pinochet.</p>
