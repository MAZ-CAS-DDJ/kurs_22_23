<p>I think my post echoes a few of your sentiments</p>

<p>Knowing what I know about the correlations of heritability of certain traits (the levels vary between men and women too) and genetic recombination, it would be difficult for the state to select for specific traits. I'll just come right out and say it, eugenics should just largely apply to non-whites, that's what every white eugenicist primarily has in mind any way. Scumbags in scum bag families can be sterilized from birth and not be given welfare at all, you could implement a one child policy as well at the least, but I think you could gear society towards chastising certain people and their behaviours anyway.</p>
<p>I still hold some desirability for eugenics, but I get he point you're making. Medicine has also allowed dysgenics and disease to actually thrive; I think there's even a part in Mein Kampf that talks about it. I know quite a lot about the health care profession and how much of a shambles it is and how much of it is a fraud; it helps that one of my sisters is doctor. It would have been my second choice profession to go into despite my radical opposition to the politics and intellectualism that surrounds the practice today.</p>
<p>Natural selection would be fine if we were in a more natural environment that favours strength rather than demonizes and degrades it; it would be able to take its course. Left wing government interference, regulations, affirmative actions and other nanny state policies and intellectualism haven't helped one bit. I've noticed something, whenever "socialism" is used, it only works well when the right wing do it. I don't really like the term socialism because it causes a lot of confusion, but even as a capitalist I know it can have its uses now and then.</p>
<p>How was your xmas, by the way?</p>
