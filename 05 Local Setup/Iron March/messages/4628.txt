<p>I've got something else for you man.</p>
<p>I did find this passage (this is the only <strong>clear cut</strong> passage I can find in the entire bible referring to pre-marital sex):</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="1695" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>
<p><strong>	Exodus 22:16-17</strong></p>
<p>1599 Geneva Bible (GNV)</p>
<p><sup>16 </sup>¶ And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall endow her, and take her to his wife.</p>
<p><sup>17 </sup>If her father refuse to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>[Female] Virginity was prized in Israel, no-one ideally wanted to marry a non-virgin. If you take some guy's daughter's virginity you either have to marry her (because her chances of marrying now are slim) or at the very least give him the cash he would have got from a regular suitor (which is conveniently £0 these days).</p>
<p>In a biblical [just] society anyway.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I wanted to ask about new military techniques and general survivalist info. I'm quite big on that stuff, I've had pyrotechnics and chemistry as a hobby since I was 14, I used to post a lot on roguesci as well; I'm quite a big fan of the US army field manuals and the Technical Munitions handbooks in particular, infact it was that which got me into pyro when I first made some black powder by using the method given in the book and thermite (which I got from the jolly roger cookbook - far, FAR from the best source but he gave a really good method of making rust). I'm more interested in the weaponry, shooting and toxicology side of things from a military perspective.</p>
