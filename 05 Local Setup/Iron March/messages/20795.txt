	This "certain way of thinking" bullshit keeps coming up every once in a while and typically from people who end up on the ban-wagon themselves as they grow more and more whiny. One time someone complained that IM was growing too much towards chan-meme-culture - that didn't happen and the guy was gassed because that inclination made him grow more anti-social with the rest of the users.

	"It's affecting the newer members" so does what they read other people say, ergo back to my original point: counter whatever you don't like in your own way PUBLICLY.

	<em>&gt;remember when younger members would put up stickers</em><br />
	No, I actually don't. When'd this happen? The times when I insistently motivated people to do it? Or do you mean people who are in actual movements and thus did activism for their groups? Moreover, stickering is the basic bitch form of activism, entry level, if they can't be motivated to do even that then do we need such people? Or the kind of people who would start being whiny cunts over something someone said like they have no backbone of their own?

	Your points literally miss the mark every time, hence why now it just sounds like you're pushing it <em>"b-buh aaaleeex i dont lieeek diiis c-cant you baaan hiiiim not-that-i-am-insisting-or-anything-but-i-will-message-you-repeatedly-about-it-time-and-again-until-you-do-it-but-its-really-your-choice-do-it-do-it-do-it"</em>

	Be the change you want to see. Want people to do activism? Do some yourself and post about it. Don't like what someone says? Confront them publicly, you can insist on someone to answer your point instead of trying to run and tattle to the principle.

	Just some months ago I remember someone else complaining about too many people have bleeding hearts for some random nigger that was killed, now there's this. From that conversation I posted to you I think the matter is settled and its pretty clear what his stance is: stop crying about random murders and killings, don't moralize or virtue-signal about them, for all intents and purposes he's just taking the "close your hearts to pity" teaching and shoving it down one's throat a bit too hard, but hey, if that's enough for someone to get uptight about the whole of Fascism/NS worldview over something ONE GUY said because it was "a little too much than my sensibilities would allow" then they are not real Fascist material, now are they?
