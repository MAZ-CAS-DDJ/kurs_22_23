<p>If I'm honest, I think it's a clash of personalities between myself and Alex <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> Security isn't important to them, but that's because they aren't part of groups or organisations. Bedroom revolutionaries aren't a threat to the state.</p>

<p>To say I'm a security enthusiast, PGP confuses the hell out of me. The issue is, I won't use something till I know 100% how it works. The public/private keys confuse me but I've not needed it, having Protonmail. GPG is for Windows isn't it? If so, it's the same, just a Windows version.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Apply for Protonmail and I guess all you can do is wait. I'll continue to keep an eye out for good email services.</p>

<p>And thanks haha, the system as it stands has taken a lot from me. I've been involved in things in the past, and I've lost a lot for my commitment to the cause. I made a pledge that anything that happened to me at the hands of the pigs and ZOG would be turned into fuel for hatred. And now I'm glad <strong>we</strong> have the chance to slay this system once and for all.</p>
<p>It means a lot that you guys need me and my services. I'm entirely self taught, so it's good confirmation. I look forward to getting to know you better too Chris.</p>
