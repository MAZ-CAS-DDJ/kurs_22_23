	Well the Eldar aren't even technically human so whiteness doesn't really apply, the dark Eldar are a shade of grey if I'm not mistaken. Aren't the Eldar similar to the orcs in that they were made as biological soldiers by the Old Ones.

	really I never see them the Imperium seems mostly white with some Asian and Middle Eastern , Even one of the chaos sorcerers is Iranian Ahriman Ahzak lol his biography says he's from the Achaemenid empire , which is a shameless plug of Persian history into Tech Barbarians.

	Actually the Eldar are a good parallel with Japan being a strong empire and then giving into degeneracy and creating tentacle porn.

	Have you actually played the table top game with miniatures did you run into neck beards ?
