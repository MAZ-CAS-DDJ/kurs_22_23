<p>Oh I don’t know, you can still get some positive IDs from that.</p>

<p>And no, I don’t think the blurry face contours are too much. They add to the vibe + it’s important to be seen to be doing everything possible to disguise the participants’ identities. Not just for the people there, but also for the assurance of potential future participants who might be watching.</p>

<p>Also, there’s a kick at 1.30 that looks reeaaaally shit. Round kicks in martial arts are thrown either with the leg in more or less complete extension the whole way through OR with the leg reaching full extension at the moment of impact. That lad’s kick was at some weird 90<span style="color:#545454;"><span style="font-family:arial;">°</span></span> angle at the point of impact and looks weak as hell. That’ll make a poor impression on anyone with any knowledge of these things. You could say that the video is meant to show a mixture of abilities – including complete novices. But it’d still look odd, to show anybody performing the technique <em>wrong</em>, in what’s essentially a promotional video.</p>

<p>Good work though Ben. Very good.</p>
