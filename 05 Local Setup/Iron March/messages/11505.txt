<p>No problem at all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Edit: I have rumbled for quite a bit and got into lot of detail on the stuff I try toexplain, so sorry for the wall of text, and sorry if it is confusing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>About the Pope, well we believe that the office of the Pope is a doctrinal institution and has no dogmatic value or necessecity. It has to do with the history of the Church. The original church was a set up as a network of local cults, with no central authority. Even the apostles organised themselves counciliarily, with Peter and Paul being the most esteemed. Peter was never made the head of the Chruch, as the other Apostles disagreed with him in questions of gentiles. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Apostles went around seeding communities, which operated as single cults without central authority, they were a group of people believing in the faith, organising in someones house secretly. As Bible and history teach us Apostles ordained priests or "presbyters", deacons or helpers, and bishops, or overseers, usually one of these preists being made an overseer of a parish, one of these local congregations. There was no central authority, and bigger cities had even several of these, including Rome. The church looked like a bunch of indepedant franchises united by dogmatic understanding, or like a "leaderless resistence" type of organisation methods discussed today. All of these communities were considered equal, and all bishops were the same. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eventually the power of the overseers would grow, as would their flock. The institution of the bishop would grow and what is called a monarchistic bishop would emerge, a bishop that is a sole spiritual ruler of a city or a region, with the rest of the clergy subservient to him. Bishops would start having other parishes subservient to their own, and became much more important then priests. Prior to that people even elected bishops, but eventually only other bishops would be able to do that. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the elevation of the bishops, some bishops became more administratively important then others. A bishop of a major city was more respected then a bishop of some rural shanty town. More well educated and better people were assigned to more important seats then the other ones,  and the seats became more and more powerfull. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the beginning parishes in the same general regions worked together, and matters were resolved with a bunch of local bishops coming together and solving the problem, making a judgement on a bishop gone astray and appointing other bishops. Local councils and synods emerged, and eventually those super important bishop seats would become de jure presidental seats of local councils. A bishop of a large city (metropolis), also known as metropolian, would became the de jure president of a local synod. Whom ever was elected to be the bishop of the large city, he would became the ruler of the council that consisted of bishophrics of other smaller cities and regions around him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>That's how the hierarchy above the bishop emerged, but even as these metropolians, archbihops and whathave you emerged, the new offices were always considered doctrinally to be just bishops as anyone else. as the church has only three real ranks, priest, bishop and deacon. All the ranks above a bishop were just administrative honorary ranks, they didnt have special blessings or sacraments, just a mere administrative jurisdiction that wasn't that high. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This process was completed by the 4th century, and saw the emergence of local churches. All bishops were considered equal doctrinally, some were considered more honored then others, and all bishops were organised in local councils ruled by a special bishop with a special title. All the local councils were considered equal, with the Pope of the Roman church being considered first in honor, equal but most esteemed to all the rest, as he was the bishop of the capital. "Primus inter pares" if you will. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few centuries later all the local churches would blob up and be finally consolidated into five churches, Church of Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria. This was the so called Pentarchy. All the bishops in it were considerd equal, and the three patriarchs and two popes were considered first in honor in their respective churches, and the pope of rome being considered first in honor of them all. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was by the turn of the first millenium that the bishop of Rome wanted to turn his primus inter pares status into something more. The Roman church wanted to subdue all the other pentarchs and bring under its fold like it did all of western Europe, and as east was weakened by the muslims. This caused a deep divide, and Rome was declared heretical by the other four pentarchs. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rome already had some doctrinal issues that we contented with and this assertion that all should serve Rome caused the Church to review these issues and it deemed them heretical, and as the western church didnt want to rescind these heresies they were condamned. The issue of filioque was most improtant, as the western church was changing the words of the Nicene Creed, saying that the Holy Spirit procees from the Son, not just the Father as the original text states, as it was adopted by the ecumenical council and declared unchangable. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was sort of tolerated by the eastern Church, until the issue with papism caused mass anathemas and a split. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Orthodox Church today still considers all the bishops to be equal doctrinally, and they are united in regional councils (autonomous churches), in which the patriarch is first in honor, and the patriarch of Constantinople is only first in honor among the patriarchs. Popes claim to be above all, and higher in spiritual rank then Bishop is heretical. Christ is the only high priest of the church, and he never appointed a vicar. That's why we cant accept the pope. Any rank above the bishop is only beaurocratic. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the schism an other doctrial issue emerged which is often looked aside by the Orthodox but I think might be one of the most important thigns aside from filioque. Its the issue of penal substitution. We believe penal substitution to be a heresy introduced in the middle ages under the influence of germanic culture and Aristotelian wanking. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe that was ontrological rather then legalistic soteriology was held by the ancient church, and that catholics introduced a legalistic one through the of penal substitution. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The idea is that Christ saved us by being sacrificed to the Father so that the angry Father would take his son as appeasement so he could forgive humanity. The idea is that sin is a crime against God, and that God has set up these rules for humanity to follow and that he punishes and rewards people after that because of these rules. Christianity uses some of these ideas as methaphors for people to understand, but they are not to be understood literally, as a different understand was prevalent in the ancient Church. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let me see if I can present this idea well</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe, and believe that the ancient church believed, that sin isnt a fault or a crime per se, but as the original word is translated an error, a miss, something affects the soul negatively in an ontological way. It is sin not seen in a legalistic but an ontological way. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What this means is that when Adam and Eve sinned, God didnt just get angry at them and expell them from heaven and forbade them to eath of the Tree of Life. It means that human nature itself fell, it became corrupt. A permanent black mark appeared appeared on the nature of human soul itself, and it became incapable of uniting with God, and humanity became incapable of eating of the Tree of Life and staying in heaven, as it essentially pushed a self-destruct button on itself and declined as a being. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Original Sin passed down from Adam and Eve isnt a persisent grudge by God but a permanent corrupt nature of man, that persists to every new human. Every subsequent sin was a further corruption of human soul ontologically, and bringing its nature against God distancing God and man more and more. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sacrifice in the Old Testament was used as a cleansing ritual to almost literally clean the soul of sin and thus bring it closer to God. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Christ incarnated He merged in Himself that Divine and human nature and created a permanent link between God and men and their ontological states. After His death, death could not contain Him, and He rose from the death shattering it. We believe that it wasnt His death but His ressurection that brought salvation, as he completed a cleansing ritual that washes away the sins of the world, and that he has shattered the very nature of death so that all that connect to him will have Life. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He sort of recreated the human nature and cleansed that first sin in way, and we sometimes refer to him as New Adam, as brings new creation to humanity. He didnt die so the Father would forgive him, but so he could cleanse and transform the nature of man. In the ancient Church, as in Orthodoxy today, the Resurrection day was the most important and celebrated holiday and event of all, with the Great Friday only being a close second, as we are saved on the Resurrection Day and not on Great Friday. With the invention of penal substitution the shift moves to Great Friday on the west, and the use of cricifix spreads. Prior to the middle ages the crucifix has been represented only in a few places. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our understanding of the Resurrection can be summed up in the Resurrectiond day troparion:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Christs has risen from the dead, through death he conquers death, and to all in the graves he has granted life"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe that salvation is the concept of theosis, meaning the joining of your own nature to Gods, of making a personal ontological connection to Christ. This is done through faith in Christ, the sacraments and the emulation of Christ in ones own life. As our minds and deeds become more and more Christ like, the Holy Spirit moves into our hearths, our souls become more Christlike and more in tune with Gods nature so that a sacramental ontological union can be formed so that Christ might dwell in us and we might dwell in Him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The forgiveness of sin, the Holy Sacrament of Confession is literally a cleansing of sin, a metanoia as it is called in Greek, meaning a changing of the mind. For sins to be cleansed the sin has to be removed from ones own nature, first psychologically then ontologically. One's own internal life and nature have to change and reject sin and then the sin is cleansed and one can work on becoming one with Christ. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As one is becoming one with Christ through communion and virtious life he is sanctified and elevated, his own nature is "Christified" or theified, and he joins in that cleansing sacrifice and dwells in Life and not in death. To join with Christ one musnt just agree with rightousness and do rightous deeds, but essentially be righteouss in his hearth and soul. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It as Paul said "I no longer live but Christ lives in me", and "You who have been baptised in Christ have put on Christ", a bit we use in our baptismal hymns. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A murderer can be forgiven not just because the priest says he is forgiven or because he feels sorry, but only because the sin of murder is no longer part of his mind and soul, he has completely rejected any desire to murder and has became in every way a non-murderer, and the "Debuff" of sin is cleansed from him by Gods blessing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Heaven and hell are therefore not a place of eternal reward or condamnation literally. Heaven is a place for those who have by their nature become heavenly, they are in heaven because they have dwelled in Christ on Earth and they continue to dwell in Christ and Life after death, as death doesnt really affect them. Hell is likewise a place for those whos very nature is sinful, they are not forcefully tortured there by God, but their own degenerate corrupt nature is torturing them. Its possible that they find Gods very nature torturous as their own sinful nature is harmed by it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>God is the source of all Being, everything "is" only because of his own nature. Those are in tune with that ontological essense of reality, that is Christians dwelling in Christ are reaffirming their own inate essense and their existence is blissfull in eternity is they are in tune with their own nature. Those who's nature has been made alien to God's are rebelling against their own ontological existence as they are distancing themselves ontologically from the one that gives them being and existence. The sinful state of man is a state of rebellion againts God's life (or existence) giving nature and is essentially a state of eternal methaphysical suicide that can never be completed. It is a state of rejecting the one who has brought us into Being and therefore forverer stemming towards Unbeing, a perpetual self-distraction that can never come through. This is all sin and hell really are. Denial and revolt againt the Creator is a revolt against our own Creation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the Orthodox view of salvation, shared by most Church Fathers of antiquity, and in some ways Judaism before ithem. I rambled on for quite a lot, but I tried to represent this doctrine as best as I could, and may have fucked up, so feel free to ask for me any corrections. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I belive the issue of theois and penal substitution to be most essential one, and I believe that the introduction of penal substitution has caused further decline in the west as it in way opened a way to individualism in protestantism. Guilt before God can be only individual, while the ontological unity with Christ also works on a horizontal level among the believers, as we believe in a mystical union between ourselves in a similar way to our mystical union with God. That's why Slavic philosophical thought has been so focused on organicism and unity. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I believe this view to be fullest and richest understanding of Christianity, and the Catholic version to be a more stripped down version that opened the flood gates of protestantism. In way it is more esoteric and fullfilling as it dwells more one a mystical union then a mere legal parental relation. Many ascpets of the Faith make much more sense to me when viewd in the light of theosis, as I spent most of my early years believing in an understanding of Christianity that I got from mives and pop culture, and fully discovering and understand the proper Orthodox doctrine was like a second conversion to me. Catholicsm speaks of blessing and sanctification but that takes a less significant importance in that theology, probably due to Aquinas and Aristotelianism. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Christ's revelation was an almost unique moment in history even when looked from a purely historicist eyes. We know that history is a history of decline, of a shift from the heavenly to the Earthly, of divine to the profane. It is said that during this decline what is implicit has to become explicit, what is internal has to become external. This is how the pure ethos becomes mere morality. In Greece a notable moment of decline was a shit from the logos to the nomos in terms of laws, a fall from divine laws to the laws of man. It was a fall from morality to mere legality, what was implied and natural to man had to be drawn for fools and made into state laws. What was in the nature of man had to be spelled out for him by a higher authority. What was in man's own character had to become a bunch of rules and regulations that he just ahd to follow. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Christ's revelation is a sort of revolution against this process. He rejects the pharisees and introduces Love that fullfills and supercedes the Law. The Law becomes something more, it becomes something that is lived and thought, something that is existentally integral to the man. Remeber the the antithesis of Matthew Chapter 5 after the sermon on the mount, where Christ points how new Christian law is much more radical then the old one, and where the old Law was just a bunch of rules and cultural customs, the new law of the Law of the Heart, it is something that is taken in on an existental level, meaning accepted and lived on a deepest psychological level. It is the true meaning of the metanoia or being born again. It is the fullfillment of Old Testament prophecy:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I will put my law in their minds and write it in their hearts. " </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is the true meaning of theosis, as theosis is a Life in Christ and becoming one with Christ, as our own hearts become so fully immersed in Christ so that we might be sanctified by him. This is the fullnest of Faith, and why the Logos became man. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now this critique of Catholic spirituality has been directed at its heyday form. Modern Catholic church and its spirituality have been so wrecked and spent that its almost impossible for it to inspire anything anywhere near the level of spirituality illistrated in Matthew 5. Many of the Orthodox would dare to say that this all happened due the Catholic churches losing the Gift of the Holy Spirit after the schism and therefore spiraled down into a radical path of decline, as east only fell after it began forcefully immitating the west, and not because of its own spiritual developement. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Like I said somewhere on the forum, around the 15th century there were too two almost simultanious rebellions in eastern and western church. In the west, the progressive mind was ravaging the remaining doctrine of the Church and starting the Reformation, wanting to strip down and simplify all tenents of the Church, and made a new spirituality in spirit of the declined age. At the same in Russia, the Patriarch did sone canonical reforms to fix some of the discrepencies that appeared between Russia and other Churches, and the people revolted en masse because they tought the sanctity of Tradition and Orthodoxy is being violated, as any meddling with the way the Church operates needs to be strongly guarded against, as it may lead to heresy and the loss of faith. The spirit of the western Church produced the Reformation, the spirit of the eastern Church produced the Russian Old Believers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This stark contrast is even more evident when you check the fasting rules, praying rules, strictness of lifes, the state of monastic community in east and west. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And I have rumbled on again after starting the closing bits, sorry again. But if you have any further questions hit me up. </p>
