<p>God's exsistence and the logic behind creation ex nihilo is a matter of physics. I'll allow reknowned and respected physicist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Davies" rel="external nofollow">Paul Davies</a> to explain for me.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="1670" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>In the everyday world, energy is always unalterably fixed; the law of energy conservation is a cornerstone of classical physics. But in the quantum microworld, energy can appear and disappear out of nowhere in a spontaneous and unpredictable fashion.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="1670" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Even though we can't see them, we know that these virtual particles are "really there" in empty space because they leave a detectable trace of their activities. One effect of virtual photons, for example, is to produce a tiny shift in the energy levels of atoms. They also cause an equally tiny change in the magnetic moment of electrons. These minute but significant alterations have been very accurately measured using spectroscopic techniques.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="1670" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>There is a still more remarkable possibility, which is the creation of matter from a state of zero energy. This possibility arises because energy can be both positive and negative. The energy of motion or the energy of mass is always positive, but the energy of attraction, such as that due to certain types of gravitational or electromagnetic field, is negative. Circumstances can arise in which the positive energy that goes to make up the mass of newly-created particles of matter is exactly offset by the negative energy of gravity of electromagnetism. For example, in the vicinity of an atomic nucleus the electric field is intense. If a nucleus containing 200 protons could be made (possible but difficult), then the system becomes unstable against the spontaneous production of electron-positron pairs, without any energy input at all. The reason is that the negative electric energy can exactly offset the energy of their masses.<p>In the gravitational case the situation is still more bizarre, for the gravitational field is only a spacewarp - curved space. The energy locked up in a spacewarp can be converted into particles of matter and antimatter. This occurs, for example, near a black hole, and was probably also the most important source of particles in the big bang. Thus, matter appears spontaneously out of empty space. The question then arises, did the primeval bang possess energy, or is the entire universe a state of zero energy, with the energy of all the material offset by negative energy of gravitational attraction?</p>
<p>It is possible to settle the issue by a simple calculation. Astronomers can measure the masses of galaxies, their average separation, and their speeds of recession. Putting these numbers into a formula yields a quantity which some physicists have interpreted as the total energy of the universe. The answer does indeed come out to be zero within the observational accuracy. The reason for this distinctive result has long been a source of puzzlement to cosmologists. Some have suggested that there is a deep cosmic principle at work which requires the universe to have exactly zero energy. If that is so the cosmos can follow the path of least resistance, coming into existence without requiring any input of matter or energy at all.</p>

<p>Davies as well as most other physicists disagree with the claim that "something cannot come from nothing".</p>
<p>Here is another take on it:</p>

<p>As you know, I was a pagan aswell, only a form of paganism which made even the average greco-roman pagan or wotanist shit their pants, Babylonian paganism - this was solely for the fact that it was productive as well as authoritarian and "purer" than the rest. If anything proved the "religion is for idiots" mantra wrong, it was certainly the history and achievements of the Sumerians and Babyloanians. I saw the great things that religion could do for people and thought that there had to be more behind it than met the atheists eyes, I started to see their arguments as fallacious and cheap and outright biased. The same goes for those Jesus never existed types, the ones who go on that Jesus was copied from other pagan religions and about the symbolism in the Christian religion, as if they never knew crucifixion was used on everyday people as a death sentence. The pagan symbolism is an issue I've dealt with other times throughout the forum.</p>
<p>I was obviously well acquainted with Sumerian texts, so I came across the similarities in that and the bible. For instance, both the Sumerians and Israelites have stories of deluges. Does that mean they never happened? No. <strong>They are simply differing accounts of the same event</strong>, of which the Bible is the only infallible one. The Sumerian texts are an inaccurate interpretation of the flooding of the Tarim Basin, which the Bible describes not only accurately (that the water came from the ground, not from the sky), but it even gives the right time and place.</p>
<p>Like I said in the other thread as well where I vaguely described my eventual conversion, the bible appealed to my base instincts which I knew to be true and I'd become more interested in the bible, biblical history and the right context so I began studying the bible more. Far from being anti-nature and the cause of the dark ages, I learnt it was the exact opposite (I've made threads about these issues on the forum also).</p>
<p>It all just started to make a lot of sense to me and add up.</p>
<p>I came across Cornelius Van Till and Rushdoony and that helped a hell of a lot, especially in regards to answering "trip up questions" that the atheists think are clever like "how can a religion not known about by some people in the world be a true religion". Besides hanging by a moral hinge (which is actual the main extent of a lot of atheistic polemics - Dawkins God Delusion comes to mind as I type this; a very unimpressive book) these were answered here:</p>

<p>It was my interest in history at first which opened me up to religion and Evola blew the lid on it completely opening me up to spirituality, a three degrees outlook; material, soul and spirit. You have to have an interest and a deep love of learning of the religion, its message and its history before you can start to become faithful. It's hard because of language barriers, different translations and the like, it takes a lot of dedication and research if you're anything like me. It's not as if Christianity is a no fun allowed religion like I originally thought it was, it meets the criteria of all of the values and outlook I identify with.</p>
<p>I have my reasons for being a protestant over a catholic, but I'll go into that at another time, but let's just put it this way, the tradition and authority from god himself set out in the bible alone is higher and greater than that of any papacy.</p>
<p>If you've got any more questions, feel free to ask.</p>
