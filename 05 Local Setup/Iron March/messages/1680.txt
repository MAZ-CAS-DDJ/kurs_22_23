<p>True, though Mchap has made some comments that have impressed me in the past. On the otherhand, he's Australian, so the specific concerns for his country aren't going to reflect Americas concerns....</p>
<p>When it comes down to agencies, the two that would have the most disproportionate impact would have to be immigration and healthcare. Getting rid of illegal immigrants would reduce unemployment immediately, and getting control on rising healthcare costs is a must for reducing medicare/medicaid, and increasing expendible income.</p>
<p>I thinking getting down to specific agencies might be a better issue once we tackle macro-scale issues. For instance, taxes- I'd suggest swapping production &amp; investment taxes in favor of a Land Value tax, implementing a 35% tariff against nations that rig their trade(such as China and Japan), and Piguvian taxes, such as BTU's, emissions, and "fat" taxes. The immediate effect would raise more reveune than currently, while reducing the cost of American products by an avg. 22-23%(according to fairtaxers), and leveling international trade. Essentially, raising revenues and reversing our trade deficit.</p>

<p>Wow, I've been swamped with work. I apologize for not getting to this sooner. I think you definitely have a lot of good ideas here. I think something we really need to focus on as a movement is the healthcare issue. Specifically developing a working healthcare model and radical response to obesity (assuming the US food supply is untouched.. I am somewhat pessimistic about the stability of the economy beyond simply whether it is going to be in a major downturn - it clearly is already). I don't think fat taxes are going to be anywhere near as comprehensive enough of an approach and it is truly a massive problem for the west. Policies I was thinking of as possible solutions include reversing PE cuts in the public school system, creation of outdoor gyms, incentives for gym membership and/or exercise under a single payer plan, zoning laws for "fast food," bans on sodas in schools, major changes to the farm subsidies and food stamp and school lunch programs.</p>
<p>On a side note I have to say that I'm averse to carbon taxes because I think it would significantly handicap american industry at a time when the US badly needs to expand its productive industries and it would probably be used to enrich certain parties (such as the banks).</p>
