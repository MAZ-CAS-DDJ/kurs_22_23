	Alright, Zeiger improved the quality of the audio. Here's what I'm thinking - I'll upload it, send you a link, you can upload this version on your soundcloud in place of the one you have up, and I'll upload a copy on youtube with a link to your soundcloud version, both should have links to the pdf and lulu purchase links and then I'll make a post with links to both youtube and soundcloud on IM in the Squire's Trial thread.
