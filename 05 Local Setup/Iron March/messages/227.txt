<p>Well, then I'm VERY green, you and mierce are pretty much as old guard as it gets for me <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> As for ethno, the pathetic part is when he completely ignores me, and thus becomes a total hypocrite in my eyes. He attacked practically everyone for not facing him on philosophical grounds, kissing up to WiB (in hid defense: this was very very disgraceful, on everyone's part that did it, I sneered and couldn't roll my eyes enough when I read those comments) and generally argueing like pussies. He was right, but that's not what I did. And then he totally ignores me- but wait, then he has the audacity to tell new members that some of us are not of "thick skin." Even put aside from all the sexual frustration and idiocy in his post about women, this alone pretty much puts him in the lowest teir someone can belong in for me. I wouldn't ban him yet, but the ban has lost it's point anyway: pretty much everyone now looks at him with scorn.</p>
