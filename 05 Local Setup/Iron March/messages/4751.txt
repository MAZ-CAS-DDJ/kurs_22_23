<p>Thanks for the compliments. I think it's easier for me because I used to be an atheist, I've worked in scientific environments as a research assistant to genticists and I'm also a former pagan so I'm well acquainted with the opposition's arguments and their fallacies, I'm well learned when it comes to genetic and geographical history and "science". I'm just looking for the truth, no matter how inconvenient it is.</p>
<p>It was the moralistic fallacies and biases of the scientific community and their attitude which turned me away from atheism, and it was a study of history, science and the bible which turned me away from paganism (was a Babylonian pagan). The Defense of the Faith by Cornelius Van Til is an exceptional must read for Christians. Hebrew and Greek concordance and use of the septuagint is vital for truth. Context is key as well. It's important to take everything as a whole. Love thy neighbour (which was first said in Leviticus) is all well and good but means nothing if racial segregation and separation is not applied and the rest of the Word is not upheld.</p>
