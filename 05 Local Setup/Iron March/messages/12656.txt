<p>Hey Akhnaton,</p>
<p>This is Blackshirt 13 here. I just though you might want to know that my order for the "comic" of Legends of the Galactic Heroes arrived today. Except, apparently it is actually the NOVEL and not the comic, I assumed it was the comic because Barnes and Noble listed it with other of those jap comics, but apparently it is actually the novel. Now I am not complaining here, I am just saying I was wrong. Anyways, it cool that I now have volume 1 of the novel in english. But I just thought that I should let you know that the version from BN is the novel and not the comic in case you would ever want a physical copy. Call me traditional or old-fashioned but I like reading actual books instead of ebooks of whatever. No offence, but I am just a book guy, anyways just wanted to let you know in case you get tired of reading it online and might want a physical copy. Let me know if you get this.</p>
<p>Hail,</p>
