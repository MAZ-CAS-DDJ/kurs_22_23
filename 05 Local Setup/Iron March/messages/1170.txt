<p>So it seems like we have similar ideological beliefs, and since I'm new to this whole thing, I was wondering if you could give me some info on Ho Chi Minh. He seems like a really interesting guy and I know the basics of his life, but Im more interested in discussing his political philosophy without having to deal with the Nationalist Capitalists.</p>
