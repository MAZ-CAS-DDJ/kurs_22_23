	Well I hate America tho Attomwaffen was stupid , if their goal was to other throw the system you don't form a group within the system , America is full of unhinged edgelords , In SIEGE James Mason said each person should be a one man army not a group with uniforms and flags , which is precisely what they did , I don't want to preserve America I want it gone.

	They wore uniforms like LARPing edgelords what did you expect from that , anything goo ? No just wackjobs looking for fellow wackjobs.Â

	Plus they didn't act like terrorists against the system more like a social club.
