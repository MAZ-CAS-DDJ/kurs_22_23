	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	I know I am do not have much rep here on IM, I primarily spend my time on the Daily Stormer BBS.  I and a couple guys are getting a bookclub/org started in Kansas.  Was wondering if you are interested or that if there is already some friendly goys we could join/work together.  I am from the Wichita area and the rest are from the KC area.  (My name on DS is JoeSchmoe if you want to look at my posts)
