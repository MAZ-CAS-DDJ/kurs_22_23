<p>lol, I wish dude, I'm not <u><em>as</em></u> imaginative as SS. I'd love to meet up and get a beer with him when he's not being thrown back in jail or being accused of being a paedophile by drunkard kosher nationalists who don't realise the age of consent is 16 here. Simon Sheppard turned me into more of a chauvinist than I already was back when I was 18, however. LOVE his heretical website. He kind of reminds me of what would happen if Charlie Manson and A.Wyatt Mann could have a baby and then that kid got raped by Boyd Rice and out comes Simon Sheppard. He just seems like a typical bloke with his own take on the world, likes to have a laugh and has an all around interesting personality but it's obvious he also has a lot of time on his hands.</p>
