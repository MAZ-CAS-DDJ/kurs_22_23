<p>That's quite an amazing story, from an atheist, to a pagan, to a Christian. That's quite the religious journey that I'm sure not many can relate to. Anyway, your links, and your intelligence has helped me so much to see the true ways of God and our Holy Bible. Congratulations on the child, and congratulations on your second. You're rather young to be a married man with children, but you seem ready for it. I can tell you're going to be a great father, and your children will be raised great Christians, take care my friend, and God bless.</p>
