	What if I went to a highschool and was shot up by a maniac I wouldn't have had a chance to even discover this type of fascism. So then just because I went to school I was a degenerate, just because I was at the wrong place at the wrong time I'm a degenerate. What if the person who got shot was already fascist and just happened to catch the bullets . This is messed up and I refuse to celebrate senseless killers.
