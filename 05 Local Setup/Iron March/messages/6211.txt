<p>Haha.. welcome to Holland... Surinamese, drugs and alcohol. You have to keep a low profile of your views in Amsterdam, it's a sewer full of left-wing activists and jews. Nowadays its full of drugsaddicts, gays, whores, feminists, non-whites, etc. That is what happens when you have a city full of left-wing activists and jews. Fucking denegeration. Amsterdam in better times: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XclUwYSirhI" rel="external nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XclUwYSirhI</a>.</p>

<p>Great till June/July, then I can take you to our memorial of SS soldiers in May. Tonight I have a meeting with some comerades, I shall mention that you are living in Amsterdam and want to meet others. Most people with our views in Holland are careful with unkown people because of recent events.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have a busy schedule till the 21th of January, but after it is possible for me to meet you.</p>
