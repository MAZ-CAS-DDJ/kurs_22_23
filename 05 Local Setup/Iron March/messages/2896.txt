<p>Thank you madam, I would not call myself a full-fledged Fascist but I follow in the great following of men like Charles Lindbergh and Henry Ford, who actually understood who is behind the control of our once beautiful democracy. I thinking of a blending of certain aspects of Fascism and Democracy being led by one man with no Parlimentary part of the government, I wish to make America a Paternal Autocrat state with a return of power to the first Americans, the people of Anglo-Saxons/Celtic origin</p>
