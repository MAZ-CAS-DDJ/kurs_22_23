<p>Well you finally changed that creepy swastika default avatar, I never liked it. I don't know what to put in avatar so I have this one for ages just so I don't get that default avatar.</p>

<p>We have a common name here for girls, Urša, from latin ursa, meaning she-bear. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> You'd probably like it. Croats don't have that name though.</p>
