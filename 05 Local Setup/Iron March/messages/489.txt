<p>Vladimir, I was wondering if you would mine telling me more about your model state.  What would qualify someone for citizenship?  What kind of forced labor would they need to perform?  What would the competencies of the elected representatives be?  What kind of electoral system would used?</p>
<p>I apologize for asking so many questions.  However, my one hang-up with fascism has been that it is too trusting of the state which as you said will, not might, become corrupted, so your posts on this topic deeply interested me.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time</p>
