	I don't really have time. Have to focus on studies. But I will visit Belgrade again sooner or later. Perhaps I can write to you and we can meet up? I'm always interested in information regarding political activism :) <br /><br />
	As for your question of NMR: they have existed for 20 years. Very marginal organization. Also there are certain things going on inside the organization that outsiders are not aware of. I can't share that with you since it was told to me by friends from NMR, but it is not good to say the least.<br /><br />
	Tbh the Finnish branch of NMR is much better than the Swedish one. I don't understand why they do not create their own organization. For too long Finnish NS-movements have been under the leadership of Swedish NS. I don't understand why... <br /><br />
	I believe that when the time is right I will start an NS-project with friends. The objective will be different from NMR though. You know the cultural, ethnic and social landscape in Sweden? This country can not be saved as a whole. We are becoming a country similar to Brazil. I think the rational thing to do is advocate for a complete halt in immigration and fight for white sovereignty in this country: attack any attempts at forced integration, communism, antifascism, liberalism, etc. Having clear objectives rather than "armed revolution" will be much more fruitful than the unrealistic idea of taking control of the national government. <br /><br />
	Last thing: You have very recognizable eyes and eyebrows. You should cover those with sunglasses if you take pictures of yourself with face-covering. Also, don't have blue curtains in the background. These things can easily be recognized in other pictures :D    <br /><br />
	Take care: Zivela Srbija!<br /><br /><br />
