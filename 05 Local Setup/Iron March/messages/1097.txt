<p>I was a Johnny come lately, the revival of the series was what kindled my love of Doctor Who. Watched a fair bit of the classic series since and I definitely prefer it.</p>
<p>It's a shame they don't do that any more, they repeat the new stuff on watch sometimes mind. My only gripe withe the classic series is the way the DVDs are released in their respective serials, in no sensible order and at a high cost. Considering that there are over 150 serials in the classic series, it makes no sense, collecting them as series would have been hard enough. Do you collect the DVDs?</p>
