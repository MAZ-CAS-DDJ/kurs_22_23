	It's more or less stagnant, except leftists and other antifa scum appearing more often on the streets in order to "fight fascism, racism, homophobia, clericalism, etc". Usually they are met with opposition from nationalists, so they won't feel too confident. One of the few current hot topics in Polish politics is the issue of abortion. The goverment wanted to introduce a total ban of abortion, but after massive protests from feminists they backed down. That's how "authoritative" and "oppresive" they are, despite the media portrayal. They still want to reintroduce the ban, though. Other than that it's ususal business of the goverment sucking USA and Israel's dicks. Our (((president))) has recently congratulated USA on bombing Syria. Fuck them all.

	Also, what pisses me off is becoming slowly more and more westernized and that means more degeneracy. It's still not as fucked as for example Germany, France or Sweden, but it's starting to be visible. Polish men are becoming more emasculated white knights, while women are becoming more masculine and career (instead motherhood) oriented. Faggotry is slowly starting to be promoted on TV programmes, including "positive" homosexual characters. The youth is caring more about dumb hedonism and meaningless relationship instead giving their life a meaning and working towards higher goal.

	On a more positive side, Catholicism is still strong in Poland. Whenever I go to Tridentine Mass, I see a lot of people, mostly older though, but a lot of families with children and younger people too. This actually brings some hope.
