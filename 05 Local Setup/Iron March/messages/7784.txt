<p>I work in tourism and I had a lot of experience with different Europeans.. I can assure you that there's a massive cultural border between North-Western Europe and ex-commie countries ie. Eastern Europe (Slavs and Hungarians + Romanians). Southern Europeans are like half/half, either they're extremely liberal or cool people. It was better there in the 80s though. Which football team do you support?</p>
