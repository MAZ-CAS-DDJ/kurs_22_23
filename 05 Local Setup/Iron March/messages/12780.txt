	the charges are serious but I have to wait 2 months to see if they charge me and they won't. It is just a pain in the arse as I have had equipment confiscated.

	8 guys is good if they all turn up. It depends what you have.

	With banners or banner drops it would only be worth your time if you had a message that will make the media, turn heads etc. Doesn't have to be too anti as the tone of the narrative is so low but nothing too cryptic or just to promote the group.

	8 ideal for leafletting in a shopping centre (depends where you are, America doesn't have a lot of packed pedestrian areas) it is more about teaching the guys ways to speak to the public in conversation. if you had a banner or flags it is something for others to do rather than stand there.

	Public speaking is good. Harassments is good - like an office for some group that will kick up a stink. best recommendation Hit the university/college - you will not recruit people directly but the exposure will be great if your message is provokative enough.

	These are purely my opinions. I don't know anything about the group and attomwaffen have experience with low numbers effective activism. Try and have back up plans or more than one activity.
