	Thanks, I will read the article (ever heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titusz_Dugovics" rel="external nofollow">Titusz Dugovics</a>?), but right now I have to give another lesson to Styr.

	Another thing. You were mentioned the cooperation between Serbian and Italian Nationalists about the territorial claims against Croatia - but what about Greater Albania, which was established by the same Italians? They even gave Kosovo to the Albans back then. I was also reading about the history of Serbian states in the Vojvodina-region, and I had to realize that you were right: it's not just the "Empire" of Jovan Nenad but also the 'Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar', which was a part of the Habsburg Empire between 1849 and 1860. Cooperating Imperial Serb = best Serb.

	Btw the guys from HVIM haven't answered since, so I have to find another way to contact them.
