	Macedonia is a complex problem because communists did enormous damage down there, practically eradicating any sign of Serbian or Bulgarian presence. Bulgarians there are powerless since Macedonians don't use their linguistic system and Serbia can use the church to bring them back to the fold. What would be the best option is to give Bulgaria some south-eastern parts and the rest to be incorporated into Serbia. We don't want Greek,Bulgarian,Romanian,Slovenian,Hungarian or Croatian land. We want to unify our own lands which today are lower Dalmatia, Slavonia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, Shkoder and Vardarska Macedonia.<br />
	Lukashenko is based.
