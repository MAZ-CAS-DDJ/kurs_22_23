<p>Well the shirts I wear are pretty blatant, but most don't have anything to say and if they do I just laugh at them and say do something which results in them just walking away snarling or muttering stupid shit. I can't say I've ever gotten into a fight over the clothing I wear, except when I start it haha.</p>
