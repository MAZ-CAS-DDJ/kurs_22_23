<p>Shalom. This is a list of posts which I would like moved from the general Australian nationalism/fascism thread (<a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/2951-australian-nationalismfascism/" rel="">http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/topic/2951-australian-nationalismfascism/</a>) to their own threads in the Australia and New Zealand section so they are easier to find for new users. </p>
<p>Can you please move my post (18) to a thread titled 'Racial views around the time of Federation', and Ratbag's reply number 19. </p>
<p>Can you move Ratbag's post number 24 to a thread called 'Eric Campbell's book The Rallying Point', and also my response 25 and his reply 26. </p>
<p>Lastly, can you move post Ratbag's posts 39 and 40, and Sine Labe's reply (41) to a thread called 'A History of Saleam's National Action'. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance, I'm being an annoying cunt I know.  </p>
