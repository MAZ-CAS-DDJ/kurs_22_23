<p>"It seems to me that nothing would be more foolish than to re-establish the worship of Wotan. Our old mythology ceased to be viable when Christianity implanted itself."</p>

<p>You truly need to educate yourself from non-Jewish sources. The myth of Hitler and the rest of the NSDAP's involvement with occultist societies such as the Thule society, were rumors spread by French propaganda. As for the quotes from Hitler saying things such as :"The revival of the worship of Wotan is the key to Germany's future".</p>

<p>Those have all been either proven fakes or mis-translations. </p>

<p>Heinrich Himmler did follow a more Germanic version of Christendom known as Irminism, but it was actually more Gnostic Christian than it was pagan. He even outlawed and imprisoned numerous groups and individuals who practiced Wotanism, such as Guido Von List (who supposedly inspired the NSDAP with his theories of Wotanism being an Aryan religion. Of course this is also false). </p>
