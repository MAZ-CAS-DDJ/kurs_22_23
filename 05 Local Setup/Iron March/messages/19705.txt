	Well, I reckon ya'll already know each other, what part of Indy ya'll live in? I'm outside of Indianapolis, east of Lawrence. I'm hoping in the future as we all get to know each other here we can meet up. I am legit, ask Slavros, I've known the IM core since before IM existed if you need proof I'm not a fed or antifa. Any of you in TradWorker?
