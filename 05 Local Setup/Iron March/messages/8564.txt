<p>Latvia is basically full blown national socialist, half of the government newly elected from Raivis's party attended the Waffen SS memorial including the speaker of the house and justice minister. They have a big girl mountain there and we were all swimming in pussy. Bunch of shops sell nazi memorabliia. I attended a re-enactment and met the guy who was in that RT thing about the guys dressed in SS uniforms for 5 year olds. I met a legionairre at the march - he sung a ditty which I am told translated roughly as "We shoot the fucking jews and march on moscow" - he gave us loads of schnapps and ghurkins on the way back. Nice guy.Â <br><br>Finland was great - fucking retarded gyspies were the best part. This guy called toamas the smasher wreaked three of them and some retarded gypsy speedwwhores went into his fridge and drank his hormones (testosterone). Snorted and smoked just about eveything the country had to offer it was good, but your molly was a thousand times better and KU needs to respect that.</p>
