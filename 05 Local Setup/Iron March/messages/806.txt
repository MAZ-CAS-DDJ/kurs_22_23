<p>Thank you, you saved me a lot of trouble, altough some things are still there, but maybe I'm too cautious.</p>
<p>Well, I find it more easy to speak with russian imperialist, than a russian hypocrate. Latvia is full of them. When someone tells me he believes that Latvia should be back in Russian empire, at least he is honest and I know how to talk with them, at least in real life. Usualy those conversations are very short <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> To say to them that we have ''rights'' of self-determination is stupid, rights are made up. It's all about the will. But I won't be making any dramas here. If there were more balts, or some georgian on the forum than these kind of fights would hapen regulary.</p>
<p>Thak you about the links, I can see that there is a lot of material to work with.</p>
