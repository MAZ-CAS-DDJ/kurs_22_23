<p>And Falangism was "pretty much" Syndicalist Nazism, Fascism was Statist Nazism, the Imperial Cult was Jap Nazism, etc. etc. We can make vague comparisons all we want. I respect both Hitler and Degrelle because they were the voices of their respective nations. In Europe certainly the race is the nation and I completely support that there, but in America I don't see that working out. America has always been different, for better or worse. We must take a different route. I honestly respect your opinions regardless of disagreeing with them, is it that much to ask for the same in return? Seems like all of your posts directed at me have little content aside from "you a fag"</p>
