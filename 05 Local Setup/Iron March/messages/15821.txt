			Can you send me a link to what bible I should get? I don't want to buy one from someone who just wants to make money, I want to buy one from a true Christian. I will begin praying from today and forward.

	There are several translations of the Bible in English. So the one that I would suggest is good for new believers is the ESV (English Standard Version), it is easier to understand. I do not know about danish Bible translations.<br /><br />
	As for wanting to buy (a physical book) from a shop, there are several true Christians who have bookshops online where you can order Bibles. Do get a physical Bible, but if you are unable too, there are several Bible apps that you can download.

	For now I would suggest that it is better that you personally develop your relationship with God (by reading the Bible and praying to God everyday) and associate with true good Christians that you personally until God himself shows you which church you should go to or not.

<p>
	This is for you to decide by listening to God and asking God what he thinks of it. Once you start reading the Bible, praying and being with God regularly, God himself will show you all these details and tell you what you should/shouldn't follow or do.<br /><br />
	Don't worry friend, God is good, and I am praying everyday for you and your life.<br />
