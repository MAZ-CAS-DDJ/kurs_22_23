	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	&gt; Hey there. sorry for the delay, this is kind of a brief response. I tried sending a response a couple of days ago and I saw it didn't work
</p>

<p>
	I've been thinking about joining National Action (you're one of the leaders, correct?) and I want to ask a few questions.
</p>

<p>
	&gt; Yes, or at least I handle PR for the group. I recommend that you also contact the website (through the contact us tab) as they deal with new members and will be arranging any meet ups. They will also have a better idea of who is in your area.
</p>

<p>
	Does Midlands contain Lincolnshire/Peterborough area? If yes, how big is the membership around here ( a ball park figure if enough)
</p>

<p>
	&gt;Ball park across the whole midlands is not big - there are only 10 in regular contact, but there is 'activity', and the people we have there are 'good' and there are drivers etc. 
</p>

<p>
	&gt; Ideally we would like to arrange a meet up as soon as possible, if this can't be done then we will try and get you at a larger gathering like leafletting. 
</p>

<p>
	&gt; obviously you are in a very good position to hit various parts of the country
</p>

<p>
	Are there any requirements?
</p>

<p>
	&gt; Obvious stuff. We have started asking new people if they have a criminal history - we make a judgement call, though I imagine you don't have one. Basically don't be a rapist, career criminal, etc.
</p>

<p>
	&gt; I noticed from your introduction that you are studying here, we really try to maintain the anonymity of all new people. I recommend you use TOR for all <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> related social media, but I will get to that.
</p>

<p>
	Just making sure, is this a group for skins to smoke weed and be anti-social? I've heard otherwise but I don't want to hang around degenerates.
</p>

<p>
	&gt; Yes it is verboten, or at least looked down upon. Before demonstrations we don't even usually allow alcohol.
</p>

<p>
	&gt; I can vouch for all the guys in the midlands that they are completely solid.
</p>

<p>
	Is it fine that I'm German? Or is it a Top hatter and tea only club?
</p>

<p>
	&gt; If you check out social media you will find that there are quite a few EU nationals in the group and that we are public about this fact, I think the closest guy to you (probably who will meet you) is a Serbian from Leicester.
</p>

<p>
	Any dress codes? I would like to see if I can spot any allies in my area.
</p>

<p>
	&gt; We ask people to wear black on demonstrations, what they choose to wear is up to them
</p>

<p>
	&gt; Unless you see someone literally with an <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> insignia you won't know
</p>

<p>
	Do you have some sort of instant messager  so I can shitpost and harass you? (jk, I just like to talk with people who have some sense.
</p>

<p>
	&gt; Yes I used facebook under my own name, feel free to add me. Like I might have mentioned using tor for facebook is advisable though it  is purely for shitposting it will give you an idea of the group
</p>
