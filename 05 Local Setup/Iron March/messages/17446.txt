	We all start somewhere, I'd just recommend searching topics regarding Fascism/NS and just lurk around. There's a lot of wisdom to be offered here. Some members are better than others obviously, but there are good people on here. Never compromise on your beliefs but always remember we can all be improved in due time.

	Also, read SIEGE by James Mason if you haven't already. I cannot recommend that enough.
