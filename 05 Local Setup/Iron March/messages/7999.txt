<p>You were right about krav maga, I'm not impressed. I don't think it should even be considered a martial arts, I read a good comment about it, something like "you can't make a martial arts consisting entirely out of bitch moves". The useful moves in krav maga are common streetfighting knowledge and some other shit reminds me of that stuff that only works in movies. I'm not an MMA fanboy but in a way it confirmed which styles of fighting are the most useful: boxing, kickboxing, muay thai, BJJ, wrestling, judo and sambo, though it overrates the ground game a bit. I'm not that afraid of going down on the ground on the street because I almost always have my crew around and the rare possibility of a situation of being in a 1 on 1 fight with a BJJ specialist and without having my crew or some weapon near me is not worth devoting years of hard training to it. What I like about boxing is that it prepares you for taking punches better, even sucker punches. Someone with grappling background can be a great fighter but if he has no striking experience and if I hit him first it's game over.</p>
<p>We're thinking about training some other skill in our gym (we mostly train boxing), I suggested we focus on knife fighting, it's extremely useful and underrated if you're preparing for the street.</p>
