<p>Hey, thanks. Always glad to bring new readers to Mark Dyal. I don't agree with him 100% on everything (<em>I'm more pro-Christianity than he is, mainly</em>) but I think he's going to be one of the greatest and most influential neo-Fascist thinkers of our time.</p>
<p>And thank you for the support. It's a fun job being in the military, I definitely recommend it to any male who's able-bodied and single.</p>
