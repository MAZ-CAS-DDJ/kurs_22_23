	I'd be open to any weekend basically. Well, I got in a car wreck a while ago but should be getting a car soon. It might be a beater when I do get around to getting one, I'm not 100% sure how things will be on Saturday as far as transportation goes but it shouldn't be a problem. I would imagine I'll have something by then.

	I don't think I'll be meeting any comrades other than you. Generally I only do on special occasions, or if I'm meeting someone it usually ends up being in Michigan or something. I do have a couple of comrades in Milwaukee anD Appleton that I met through various nationalist meetings but I don't think I'll be driving that far. Especially considering I'll likely have a beater of a car when we meet up.
