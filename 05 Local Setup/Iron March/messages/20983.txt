	I live in the Northeast, so I have a tightknit crew of ex-Mil and Security I train with. We do hikes, gym sessions, live firing exercises, and we eventually plan to buy a lot of land. Can't really specify the name or details because its an inner-circle thing,Â but it will serve its purpose when the time comes. Think of it as a modern day SS.

	I got offered to do Recon/MARSOC but I've heard going straight into indoc after boot is risky. Like kids will fail and become Airwingers or get moved to some really lame pog job. I'd rather complete ITB and then try it out.
