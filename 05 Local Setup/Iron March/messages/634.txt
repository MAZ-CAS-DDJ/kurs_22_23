<p>Hi Talleyrand, how goes with your boss, Nap?</p>
<p>However, I need your help for a serious thing, and I beg you.</p>
<p>You should probably know the project for the high speed train course settled in the zone between south-eastearn France and north-western Italy; I would like to know if it is thrue that in France the work for the french part of the route  started but stopped after becasue of the delay in the italian part of the project, and if there is an opposition against the project also in your country; I ask this to you because I got confused by a ton of different versions on this issue and I would like a sincere opinion.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
