<p>Sorry I fell asleep last night. </p>

<p>Yeah thats true, but I've been redpilling people hard and the last few months with the riots and shit its just reverted back to bluepills. It's like everything I said about black on white crime or Jewish manipulation of media was forgotten within a day or they just didn't care to begin with. Its a little saddening, I even redpilled a black friend into hating the Jews and realizing that Europe is being displaced by Muslims, but now hes back to "muh oppression, gibsmedat welfare". I blame college, he's been taking classes that are mind-poison in polite terms</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm kinda cutting ties from most of my friends, I'm realizing most are lazy as shit and drag me down. Ironically the black one is the only other guy in my group with a job. </p>

<p>I'm pretty worried for Europe, Eastern Europe seems to be in a healthy state at least culturally and physically, but Western Europe is really scaring me. My ancestors, the Suebians, the Alemanni, the Anglo-Saxons, the Teutons, the Franks and Gauls, all of them built Western Europe up from mud and darkness and now their children, my distant cousins, are throwing it away. The Germans and English I have met were so effeminate and weak....it's like high schoolers that never grew up. They'll be butchered like animals if any sort of invasion came to them, as if it isnt now </p>
