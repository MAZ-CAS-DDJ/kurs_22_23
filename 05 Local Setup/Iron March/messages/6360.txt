<p>Hope you don't take this badly, but I just wanted to know how the republics worked under Yugoslavia. Like, were you being ''Serbianized'' or you had a cultural independence? Would you like to have a new Yugoslavia as a kingdom?</p>
<p>Just curiosity, I am formenting a new view to Brazil and this would be useful, Thanks.</p>
