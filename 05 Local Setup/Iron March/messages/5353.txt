<p>That's very reasonable; I think the fact that communism is utopian is the thing that can turn people off from it, I've found communism mainly appeals to intellectuals (who always end up dead under real communism, or atleast the closest thing to it - like Cambodia). Communism degenerates further 2 ways, it goes to either the extreme lengths of totalitarianism and death or to the left and becomes a hodge podge of contradictions or soemthing else entirely, anarcho-communism, "stop liking what I don't like" anarchism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The internationalism vs nationalism debate is of upmost importance. There's a huge ideological and principled difference between something like WU(FE)NS and international Jewry (Marxism).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's one of the main articles I've been reading and a popular one:</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>
<br /><p><b>Why Are We Nationalists?</b></p>
<p>We are <b>nationalists</b> because we see the <b>nation</b> as the only way to bring all the forces of the nation together to preserve and improve our existence and the conditions under which we live.</p>
<p>The <b>nation</b> is the organic union of a people to protect its life. To be national is to affirm this union <b>in word and deed</b>. To be national has nothing to do with a form of government or a symbol. It is an affirmation of <b>things,</b> not forms. Forms can change, their <b>content </b>remains. If form and content agree, then the nationalist affirms both. If they conflict, the nationalist fights <b>for the content</b> and <b>against the form.</b> One may not put the symbol above the content. If that happens, the battle is on the wrong field and one’s strength is lost in formalism. The real <b>aim of nationalism, the nation<i>, </i></b>is lost.</p>
<p>That is how things are today in <b>Germany.</b> Nationalism has turned into bourgeois patriotism and its defenders are battling windmills. One says <b>Germany</b> and means the monarchy. Another proclaims <b>freedom</b> and means <b>Black-White-Red</b> <b>[the colors of the German flag]</b>. Would our situation today be any different if we replaced the republic with a monarchy and flew the black-white-red flag? The <b>colony</b> would have different wallpaper, but its nature, its content, would stay the same. Indeed, things would be even worse, for <b>a facade that conceals the facts</b> dissipates the forces today fighting against slavery.</p>			<p><img height="383" src="http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/images/haken/haken01.jpg" width="512" alt="haken01.jpg" /></p>	<p><b></b></p><div><b>Explanation: A tied-up Nazi watches while a Jew holding the </b></div><b>
<i></i></b><div><b><i>Berliner Tageblatt,</i></b></div><b><i></i></b><div><b> which the Nazis accused of being a Jewish paper, mistreats a Germany chained to the Treaty of Versailles. The Jew is probably supposed to be a journalist, since he is smearing Gemany with his pen. A Black French colonial soldier and a policeman assist. The policeman is likely Polish (since Germany lost territory to Poland as a result of the Treaty of Versailles).</b></div><b></b>
<p></p>
<p>Bourgeois patriotism is <b>the privilege of a class.</b> It is the real reason for its decline. When 30 million are <b>for</b> something and 30 million are <b>against</b> it, <b>things balance out and nothing happens</b>. That is how things are with us. We are the world’s Pariah not because we do not have the courage to resist, but rather because out entire national energy is <b>wasted</b> in eternal and unproductive <b>squabbling between the right and the left.</b> Our way only goes downward, and today one can already predict when we will fall into the abyss.</p>
<p><b>Nationalism</b> is more wide-reaching than <b>internationalism.</b> It sees things as they are. <b>Only he who respects himself can respect others.</b> If as a <b>German </b>nationalist I affirm Germany, how can I hold it against a <b>French</b> nationalist who affirms <b>France</b>? Only when these affirmations conflict in vital ways will there be a <b>power-political</b> struggle. Internationalism cannot undo this reality. Its attempts at proof fail completely. And even when the facts seem to have some validity, <b>nature, blood, the will to life, and the struggle for existence on this hard earth</b> prove the falsity of fine theories.</p>
<p>The sin of bourgeois patriotism was to confound a certain economic form with the national. It connected two things that are entirely different. <b>Forms of the economy</b>,<b> </b>however firm they may seem, are changeable. <b>The national is eternal.</b> If I mix the eternal and the temporal, the eternal will necessarily collapse when the temporal collapses. This was the real cause for the collapse of liberal society. It was rooted <b>not in the eternal,</b> but in <b>the temporal,</b> and when the temporal declined it took the eternal down with it. Today it is only an excuse for a system that brings growing economic misery. That is the only reason why <b>international Jewry</b> organizes the battle of the proletarian forces against both powers, the economy and the nation, and defeat them.</p>
<p>From this understanding, the young nationalism draws its absolute demand. <b>The faith in the nation</b> is a matter for everyone, never a group, a class or an economic clique. The eternal must be distinguished from the temporal. Maintaining a rotten economic system has nothing to do with nationalism, which is an affirmation of the Fatherland. I can love Germany and hate capitalism. Not only <b>can </b>I, I <b>must.</b> Only <b>the annihilation of a system of exploitation carries with it the core of the rebirth of our people.</b></p>
<p><b>We are nationalists because as Germans, we love Germany.</b> Because we love Germany, we want to preserve it and fight against those who would destroy it. If a Communist shouts “Down with nationalism!”, he means the hypocritical bourgeois patriotism that sees the economy only as a <b>system of slavery.</b> If we make clear to the man of the left that nationalism and capitalism, that is the affirmation of the Fatherland and the misuse of its resources, have nothing to do with each other, indeed that they go together like fire and water, then even <b>as a socialist</b> he will come to affirm the nation, which he will want to conquer.</p>
<p>That is our real task as National Socialists. We were the first to recognize the connections, and the first to begin the struggle. <b>Because we are socialists we have felt the deepest blessings of the nation, and because we are nationalists we want to promote socialist justice in a new Germany.</b></p>
<p>A young fatherland will rise when the socialist front is firm.</p>
<p>Socialism will become reality when the Fatherland is free.</p>

<p>That's just a small excerpt from that article but it's an important one. The next important step is letting people know that Jews have perverted the meaning of SOCIALism far beyond its means, Ben Klassen gives a good run through of this idea really well in Nature's Eternal Religion but we know much more now through research and can word it even better - i.e. our own words, therefore giving personal yet concrete meaning and understanding to it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've foun like was pointed out in another NatSoc article I posted here yesterday that you can point out character "flaws" and hypocrisies about their leaders, e.g. Marx's racism, "imperialism against Mexico", bitterness towards his parents, freeloading and other stuff like that but they'll just dismiss it as "a sign of the times [...] so what? everyone was racist BACK THEN"</p>

<p>Nothing has changed concerning the tactics of real leftists. I don't know when I'll put the thread up it gets a bit busy, espc. during the weekend with the kid other stuff.</p>
