<p>Could you link me to the American Front?  After a (admittedly cursory) google search I could find nothing but information on the skinhead group.</p>
<p>Would the composition of this vanguard party be multiethnic or not?  Or would it be a confederation of ethnic parties agreeing that the system must be destroyed and the post-unrest system would entail a dissolution of the union along ethnic lines?</p>
<p>I'd also ask what kind of ethnic consciousness can we cultivate in White Americans?  The White ethos is at its most militant basically FC.  We could try to run with the David Duke Euro-American concept, but what parts of European culture do we want to claim?  I feel like the best solution would be an even further breakdown of the Union from White, Black, Brown, and Red homelands to German, English, Irish, American, etc homelands generally along the lines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Census-2000-Data-Top-US-Ancestries-by-County.svg" rel="external nofollow">this map</a>.  I understand that that is about as unrealistic a political proposition someone could make with a straight face, so I am eager to hear any alternatives you have.</p>
