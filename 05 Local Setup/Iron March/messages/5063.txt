<p>Hi, I'm Ozymandias, I live in Seattle, Washington in the United States and I was wondering what you're views on the Japanese who no longer live in Japan or any of its territories.</p>
<p>From what I have seen from those who currently live here, the youth are primarily concerned with becoming "Americanized" while much of the older generation seem to be Clinging to many of the old traditions of Japan. Some I have met still revere the Imperial Family and claim that your emperor still withholds divinity.</p>
<p>What are you're thoughts and views? </p>
