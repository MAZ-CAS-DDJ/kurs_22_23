<p>We're having another family over for dinner tonight, the couple has six or seven kids. Goals!</p>
<p>Ah, that's awesome. My godfather was drunk once, his girlfriend was staying over. I was staying there too, his daughter is my good friend. Somehow we got onto the topic of the Jews, he said they did nine eleven, that they deserved the Holocaust, that it will happen again, etc, etc. The poor woman's face was hilarious.</p>
