<p>The bulk of the militia movement believe they are fighting against fascism. Fascism in its full form is fundamentally un-American. Though in many ways the USA pioneered many aspects of fascism, a fully developed, fully articulated fascism never developed here. Only among the white nationalists -- who have a sense of community -- will any fascist/intregalist ideas make headway.</p>
<p>I do not openly proclaim that I am a fascist because it destroys my "credibility" before I have even established it. So, in that sense, I am a subversive, preferring to tear down in order to build up. That is a long and arduous process; thankless in the short-run.</p>
<p>I'd be careful about preaching these ideas to militiamen. Some of them are Glen Beckers or libertarians or paleo-conservatives who might pick up your scent.</p>
