<p>Whilst I can imagine you've probably run a mile and might even ignore this message altogether, I feel obliged to send it.</p>
<p>I cam to Iron March almost exactly like you; I hated the ridiculous amount of homophobia and bigotry and I felt like "this wasn't for me" and so on.</p>
<p>However, I've come to realise that Iron March isn't a movement, nor a homogenised group; it's just a place for third positionists of any and all flavour to come and be free of the liberal-conservative bias that pervades the mainstream media.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'd really not like to lose another moderate member (Guild Socialists and Social Conservatives tend to be scared off, and I can't blame them). So, if you'd like to stay in touch, here's my email:</p>
<p>pelagius_cromwell@outlook.com</p>
<p>Or you can tell me if there are any other forums you hang around.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Cromwell</p>
