<p>I don't travel that much lately, I used to travel a lot when I was younger. I speak Slovene, English, Croat/Serbian, Latin (well I understand it, you don't learn Latin to "speak" it), German. A bit of Spanish and Italian. Also, my ancestry is from region in eastern Slovenia which was part of kingdom of Hungary and which has a dialect that used to be considered a language of its own up until 1918. I consider it as an independent language too. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prekmurje_Slovene" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prekmurje_Slovene</a> So you might count that one too. I still speak to my father only in this language, never in Slovene. Here it's normal to speak more languages because of cultural influences, we're a small nation. In larger nations like France and Italy though, you're lucky to find someone who speaks English. </p>

<p>Croatian food.. Heh there's tons of good food. What I like most is Serbian food like Pljeskavica <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pljeskavica" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pljeskavica</a> It's popular all over Balkans and in Slovenia too, we always eat this on barbecues. I'm going to eat it right now in fact, I'm going to a Bosnian restaurant with friends </p>
