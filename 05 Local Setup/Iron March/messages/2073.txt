<p>Maxed out graphics? Max them out if you can?</p>
<p>I'd say the Samsung wins out of those two. Almost every spec is the same apart from the refresh rate. The Asus has a max refresh rate of 85hz and the Samsung has 120hz. Whether you need a  monitor that goes above 85hz depends on if you plan on playing games at above 85fps.</p>
<p>This is just my opinion - and you may feel differently - but I don't particularly like large monitors like that for PC. I like to sit up close to my computer and I don't like having to move my eyes to see something in a different part of the screen. Other people think of it like an IMAX cinema, so to each his own.</p>
