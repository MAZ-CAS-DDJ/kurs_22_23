<p>Sorry, I heard "hardcore catholic" and now all i can think about are heavy metal bands playing in churches. I envy people with faith, it's normally something you need to grow up with.</p>

<p>Wanna skype lass? I'll probably be less likely to ramble like I do here <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> Message I mean, I don't have a camera or anything like that at the moment. I'm an antisocial pleb who was only introduced to it recently but I'm assuming everybody else has it. Also rambling again.</p>
