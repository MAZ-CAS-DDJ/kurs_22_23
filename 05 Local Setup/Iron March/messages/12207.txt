<p>Yeah its cool to have a professor, all of my professors were normies or hard core liberals.I never discussed politics because its pointless. One socialist slightly nationalist director made some documentary about how our courts overreacted when some football fans accidentally killed a guy in a fight, as they blamed the "murder" on nationalism and documentary critiqued that verdict, and one of my professors really got mad at the documentary and sperged out about it on some hipster forum and making death threats and shit, and got sued and convicted for a 1 year sentence. But he still hasn't served and still teaches. I have some really shit professors in general, but I guess that's a given when one studies philosophy. Philosophy tends to be for liberal pseudointellectual faggots anyways.Â </p>
