<p>Hey, thanks for that. It's good to be noticed, better still to be <em>understood</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah, first time I've logged in in a while. I've lurked a bit in the meantime though. If only for a dose of Liberal Degeneration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not sure if this is really my scene to be honest. I don't get into all the particularisms, the various cults of personality and the inter-right feuding. So I'm pretty aloof with regards to interactions - be it here, Stormfront, New Right circles/blogopshere, Libertarian ('free speech') boards, (not that any exist anymore) VNN, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for Skype, I'm pretty anti-social to be frank. Bitter-vet syndrome maybe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Still, is there an affiliated chatroom for Ironmarch? Something more casual than a forum but less intimate than a vidcall would be preferable at this point. Could audio, but I'm not in the habit of calling strangers. Again, It's not personal.</p>

<p>I'm in Australia btw, thus my little 'Mini Free' bio line.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well met.</p>
