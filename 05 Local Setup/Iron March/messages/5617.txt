<p>Greetings comrade! </p>
<p>I recall that you had some books of Junger translated in English. Notably the "Worker". Thing is I tried to procure it and i could only find the original German version. I would like to ask if you have finished translating the text and if you could send it  to me in a pdf or something...Thanks in regard </p>
