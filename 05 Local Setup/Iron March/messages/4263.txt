<p>No I believe they should learn French or English. Just keeping their native tongue (and passing it on to their children) as well. I might not have made that clear enough.</p>
<p>Nor do I suggest that white Canadians would be able to seemlessly transition to European life. I think it's very positive that we have things like Hockey, Canadian beer, and Tim Hortons (even if that last one might be a bit consumerist it's still a source of national pride) to call our own, just as an Irishman may have his Irish football, Irish beer, and pubs. What I do mean to suggest is that by virtue of common ancestry we share the same spirit. It's in our blood. We naturally are closer to those who are biologically speaking more similar to us.</p>
<p>I don't believe you can create a 'new Canadian man' and I don't believe that you should. I believe that Canada can host multiple homogeneous cultures all a part of our heritage, and that's a good thing. A formless mass of cultureless mongrels with no ethnic pride is much easier to exploit and much less beautiful.</p>
<p>I believe strongly in the nation state idea. The nation and state should be indistinguishable from each other. Since people naturally feel loyalty to their own people, race, culture, etc. the loyalty to the state you seem keen on will be much easier to maintain under such a form of government.</p>
