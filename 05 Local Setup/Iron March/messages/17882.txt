	Ok you didnt read the intro materials, did you read the guidelines?
</p>

<p>
	Section 1.5 falls under 'Sperging'
</p>

<p>
	<strong>1.5 - </strong>Conduct. It is your responsibility to judge group relations and know what not to post and where things should be posted. When you can participate in a forum drama, promote yourself, <em>become insolent towards members,</em> etc, is something only you can judge
</p>

<p>
	When you, someone who doesn't understand fascism as well as us, tell <em>us </em>we need to learn more about fascism and NS then you have some serious problems. No one here subscribes to you basic bitch liberal view of fascism/NS. You can either a)learn or b)continue acting like a retard and we will keep treating you like one.
