<p>I'll be 51 in a couple days.  As far as intellectual side of things, I'm really</p>
<p>impressed with the American Freedom Party.  They are led by some</p>
<p>pretty smart people and Tom Sunic is connected as well.  They have a</p>
<p>potential to connect with average people as well as intellectuals.  I don't</p>
<p>think they compromise on anything I believe in when it comes to nationalism,</p>
<p>racial preservation, or the Jewish question.</p>
