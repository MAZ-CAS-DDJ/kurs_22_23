<p>Are you serious? I thought that was your work!<br /><br />Music, that's a good way. It's how I learned Swedish! And I like to sing to the babies in different languages. And good for you, it's such a good feeling to watch the language become less and less... foreign!<br /><br />And again, good for you! It's maddening what boredom will do to you, leads down all kinds of unsavory paths... That's always when my running was best, lol, when I got bored and was resisting xD<br /><br />ANd my day is lovely, really good. Yours?</p>
