<p>I know, it seem super crazy to think about. I've never asked questions when I meet them, who knows where their hearts are. I just always think of this story:</p>
<p>Haci Bektash Veli once told one of his mursid to go take a sack of grain to a near by village where an Christian priest had prayed to God for sustenance because the village's crops had done poorly that year.</p>
<p>So the mursid takes the grain and along his way sells little bits of the grain to passer-by people. "This priest isn't even a Muslim" he thought. "So why should I bother giving him the full bounty?".</p>
<p>Eventually he arrives at the church with half the amount of grain he was sent with. </p>
<p>He meets the priest who thanks him and asks him to accompany him to worship God in thankfulness for his safe travels. The priest took the mursid to the basement of the church where, in an Eastern wall, he had dug out a mihrab and placed a candle. The priest the made sujoodnand said "oh Allah, thank you for protecting this selfish devotee and providing my people with food and blessings. " . The mursid instantly felt horror and shame at his judgement of this man and how he had given away so much of the grain. But when he looked behind him at the sack of grain, it was full again. </p>
<p>When he returned back to Haci Bektash Veli and recounted his story, Veli replied "all slaves of al-Haqq are given their just due, no matter what their shackles are made of"</p>
