<p>Cheers for the videos, I had no idea the impact was so profound to the asian community that it actually made them pack their shit up, I was just in Perth overnight for a metal gig, American band named 'Sleep' and the city seems gone, every corner a squat asian, man I don't know how you stay sane working in there and healthy, to boot, they all look like bird flu carrying mongols, man I saw some harsh faces, when the time comes in Australia, the enemy won't look to far beyond the commies in that Horst Wessel movie from 30's Germany, when the time comes that revolutionary politics are needed, our enemy will be well and truly strong and filled in ranks with these red Chinese, visited freo too, tore down a few red/Marxist posters, that place would be rife for some good old NA style ambush, being a uni town, saw some bums that turned out to be uni students, notre dame too? Catholic reds? I wouldn't be surprised if there were Jesuits hidden up in there ranks.</p>
<p>I joined Australia First a couple years back my activism only spread to putting flyers in letterbox's and stickers at pubs, a nationalist party from NSW, with shoddy aesthetics in an almost all white town made up of 70% old folks, can't say it had any impact. They'll head the same way early labor did without a coherent NS worldview, shrouded in Australiana and as stalwart mentioned to me, over east there name has been slandered that much that it's probably a bit of a pox on nationalism, can't fault saleams integral nationalism essay, I plan on printing that one out as an iron marcher suggested, and spreading it about albs. Cheers for the link, I think I will grab a copy off amazon, PDF or write it out, if I think it's worthy of so, would be nice seeing an Aussie section in the fascist archive, want to do the same for Campbell's book, if I can find it. I'd like to expound on the potential in mining to recruit nationalists, majority white and patriotic but very well off, to the point that it's hard to get them to understand there is something wrong..</p>

<p>Hey mate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Might sound weird but I'm actually so used to non-whites I sort of gloss over their presence in a way- I'm always aware of how many there are around me, particularly when there's very few (you notice immediately &amp; it gives you a good feeling) or when you see some really fucking ugly ones (like abos, &amp; lots of African types), but I have to work with a few, had to study with plenty in classes - and even lived with some in share-houses- so I'd go nuts if I let their presence get to me too deeply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tbh over the years I've kind of moved towards the same views as other IMers- as a racist I know race shapes intellect, behaviour, ability, etc., but I still try &amp; treat people on an individual level, even if they are radically different or notably inferior to me. If they act decent to me I'll be decent back, even if they are stupid fuckers and/or I don't want them here, just because we're fash doesn't mean we have to be arseholes- even the Reich worked respectfully with Arabs, Japs &amp; other types. I find this harder with some groups than others (Pakis, Arabs, abos) but it's how I'm trying to deal with things for now. Some here have pointed out you can gather more natural respect if you're <em>seen</em> as a bit respectable- people will be shocked when they find out you're an unashamed fash/racist because you don't act like a stereotypical cartoon 'Nazi' who spits on their Chinese coworkers or whatever, really throws them &amp; makes them rethink things; I haven't got to this stage myself but I appreciate the logic. Do agree with you though, the Chinese presence here really worries me. Mainly the fact we're flogging off so much land &amp; assets to their state corporations &amp; simultaneously bringing so many in, that is complete national suicide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I get we're you're coming from with Australia First. I do honestly think those Old Labor ideas have potential to gather popular support (especially now disillusionment with both major parties is so deeply-felt), but not under Saleam's organisation- I respect him for his writing &amp; ideas but yeah, my impression is he has too much baggage to ever make headway as a political leader/organiser, the AF has issues. You could definitely merge Old Labor ideas with a form of NS I reckon, there's untapped potential there. I myself was actually a member of the Protectionist Party for a few months years and years ago- admit though I never did any activism, just joined because it was a cheaper way to get their magazine than a straight subscription haha. I left pretty quickly tho, they quickly turned into a cut-rate version of Family First- also they're pro-Zionist now, so fuck them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Definitely think you could recruit from miners, mate. I'm pretty middle-class myself but I tend to get along quite well with bogans (which a lot of miners are, right?), they're way more straight-up, relaxed, &amp; less-PC than us bourgeois. Also liked you ripping down posters, lol. I used to do that at uni when I was first enrolled years ago. I finished my final degree just a few months back and mate, you would be horrified at how vocal the Trots (Socialist Alternative) are on campus, they're really active. Aussie students are so apathetic tho that they almost totally ignore them, haha, they're just annoyingly vocal. If you &amp; I ever meet up maybe we could head to one of the unis &amp; systematically rip down their posters &amp; slap up IM stickers instead, would be a laugh.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyway mate I'll leave it there, I wrote you another damn essay (that's the problem with us ex-uni students, we're full of hot air haha). Btw I finally made a post giving a quick history of the ANM <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/3853-why-were-wn-so-cool-back-then/page-4" rel="">here</a>, and made a post in your Aussie nationalism thread. I'm currently gearing up to add stuff to that myself, might take me a bit of time though but it's coming. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
