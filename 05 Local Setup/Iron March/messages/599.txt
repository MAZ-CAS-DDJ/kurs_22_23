<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Before we all welcome you to the boards, please take the time to post and introduction in the suitable forum, so the older posters can get to know you better: <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/forum/11-introductions/" rel="">http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/forum/11-introductions/</a></p>
<p>It is the customary thing to do here. Thanks by advance! :-)</p>
