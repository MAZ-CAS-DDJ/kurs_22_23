			About Bratislava: It was ethnical cleansing of already cleaned area. Before Bratislava it was Prešporok/Poszony(sorry if it is written baddly)/Pressburg and before P./P./P. it was Preslava-Slavic land. When will Serbians get Kosovo back, even after 1000 years, i'm sure they will try to clean it like šiptars did before them.

	Nah. It's not the same situation m80:
</p>

<p>
	In the Middle Ages nation and people were two different concepts, and the word nation was used for the aristocracy only. Nobody gave a rat's ass about the common people, what language they spoke or what kind of blood they had in their veins was irrelevant as long as they served the aristocracy and the king. Hungarians did change the demographics of the area but it happened slowly and organically without ethnic cleansing given the fact that nobody was thinking in ethnic terms.
</p>

<p>
	Just think about it, if Hungarians would wanted to assimilate every nation within the Kingdom we could have easily done it over a 1000 years - but we didn't. You can read about a lot of Hungarian noblemen of various ethnic backgrounds, but it was natural that if you were part of the aristocracy you were part of the Hungarian nation regardless of your ancestry.
</p>

<p>
	You say it was Slavic land before, but there were Celts, Romans, Huns, Germans, Avars there, all of them before the Slavs who by the way came here <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/The_Donets_Basin_is_the_heart_of_Russia.jpg" rel="external nofollow">from the East</a> just like Hungarians. Even when Hungarians conquered Pressburg it wasn't defended by Slavs but Germans.
</p>

<p>
	The historical connection between our nations is natural, the modern hate is artificial.
</p>

<p>
	I have just found <a href="http://real.mtak.hu/19492/1/Opava_cikk_1_resz_2014_u_115711.29745.PDF" rel="external nofollow">this writing</a>, in which there is a quote from Hlinka:

			As soon as there is time and opportunity to break away from the Czechs, I leave it to Karol Sidor, who is the most competent representative of the will of the nation and myself, to negotiate with the Hungarian government about the Slovaks’ unification with Hungary bearing in mind the conditions of autonomy, which result from the programme of our party.

	What do you think? Have you heard about this before?

	Of course and that's what winners always do, but then this narrative that all they wanted is the 'free self-determination of nations' is false and they wasn't fighting against tyranny after all.

	Basically. :D Nah I'd just correct its grammar if I have the time and then send it back to you.

	Thanks for your description of Clerical Fascism, it looks like it was one of the best systems. Sadly today's Fascist movements aren't really interested in finding God's ways...

	One of the Romanian guys translated some quotes by Codreanu:
</p>

<p>
	"The people are not lead by their will: democracy. Neither by the will of one man: dictatorship. But by laws. It's not about man made laws. There are natural laws of life and death. A nation goes to it's death or life accordingly to the way it respects this laws."
</p>

<p>
	"The final goal is not life (...). This final moment of 'resurrection' is the highest and most noble purpose that can arise from a nation."
</p>

<p>
	"The nation is thus an entity that prolongs it's life beyond this earth. The nations are realities in next world also."
</p>

<p>
	"The first problem that was addressed to us was: who should answer first? Who are more guilty of the rotten times we live in: Romanians or Jews? We thus, agreed that the first and biggest of the guilty party are the traitorous Romanians, who for the Jewish silver, betrayed their kin. The Jews are our enemies and thus hate us, poison us, exterminate us. The Romanian idlers that align with them, are more then enemies: they are traitors. The first and most cruel of punishments comes first to the traitor, then the enemy."
</p>

<p>
	"The legionnaire loves death, because through his blood we will build a Legionary Romania."
</p>
