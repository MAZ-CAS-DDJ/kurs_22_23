	Pretty good thanks for asking. I'm in exam period now so I don't have much time for reading but I read that "intro to fascism" ebook, it was pretty good but not much I didn't know already tbh. Again like I stated I'm not a TRS or daily shoah guy, never was really into that other than lurking the forums for a while, but when they went through their purges I quit voluntarily. I agree TRS is faggotry but I have to admit this obnoxious virtue signalling during the "extreme vetting" process at Iron March is also pretty much faggotry. I have been reading some interesting posts on here so I definitely see that it's not all like that thank God but damn I have kind of been turned off from IM a bit given how hard people try to be fashy in the intro forums. I have to say this first impression kind of turned me off a bit though I will still check back here more thoroughly after my exam period and go through the content a bit more since there definitely are some good content and conversations to be found here, I just wish people at least tried to be more subtle in their counter signalling TRS it's almost suspicious how gay they are in their virtue signalling.
