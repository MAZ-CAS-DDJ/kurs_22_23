<p>It's got nothing to do with personality, what the fuck is the point of trying to portray my personality on a Internet forum? You really are autistic. </p>
<p>It's cool to joke around, be silly whatever you want to call it. But that post you made is the part of IM I'd like to keep out, not completely but for the most part as it really makes things look stupid.</p>
<p>I'm sure you contribute a lot since you have been here for a while now. And if you didn't start with the trolling I wouldn't have a problem with you. In fact I don't have a problem with you at all, I don't even know you lol. What's the point of fighting like this over the internet? </p>
<p>Anyways it's up to you, do whatever you wish. There's just no point since it's no sweat to me, and just raises your blood pressure.</p>
