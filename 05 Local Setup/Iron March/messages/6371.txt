If you wanna hear a personal account: his contribution was teaching the disastrously inexperienced samooborona how to make bombs, which they obviously didn't end up using (out of fear of Army retaliation), consulted with the leaders of the samooborna to attack from Institutskaya street (it was clear that the VV and Berkut were more concentrated on Hrushevskogo street, leaving a weak defence of Institutskaya - I'm sure that at least more than one SO leader observed this), and informed them about the underground tunnels which they ended up finding and standing guard for, in case any of the politicians decided to escape using them. Having grown up in the area (we still own a place on Bogomoltsa street - I'm inheriting it, which is why I'm back in Ukraine), he had a lot of insider info about the streets and especially the codes for the residential buildings which were used to house the "surprise ambush" that began the fighting (attack on police barricades) on Institutskaya, on Feb 20th (or was it the 19th? this whole thing's almost a blur now), which our guys fucked up in, since the idea was not to attack head-on, but to go in "from the sides", whatever that means.<br /><br />3. username: stan.przhegodsky<br />A little background info: Born in Kiev, 23 years old, lived in Toronto for 15 years, moved back, been living in Kiev for 3 years now, hence why I prefer to use English and can't type on a Russian keyboard.<br /><br />Yestli hochesh, ya mogu skhodit' na razvetku. Mozhet dazhe poluchitsya ot Yarosha interview dostat' - yestli u tebya yest k nim any specific voprosi.<br /><br />Anyway, Slava Ukraini, i Slava Rossiyi.<br /><br />- Stan</p>
