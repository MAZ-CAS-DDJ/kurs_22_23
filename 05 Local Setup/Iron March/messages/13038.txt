	I have thought about it to and if we do it I believe it has to be formed around a job then it can be broaden and develop from there. a power plant is the perfect one to do. not alot of competition. once we build one then we can build more and other jobs. from there we can build private cities that supply so much they would not be able to destroy us. power plants are set up to cost a lot of money more then what they should cost. of course the reason why is they can't outsource it yet. but i have the ability to create a new kind of plant that will become the standard of all future plants. we need to work together to get this done. regulations, rules, accounting, hiring process, city architecture, education for children, and healthcare. right now we need to plan it out. pen to paper.
