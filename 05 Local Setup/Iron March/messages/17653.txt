	Haha congrats Lance Coolie. Have you considered Academi (Blackwater)? I'm not too sure what they're up to these days but that's typically what most guys go for. Honestly the volatile conflicts these days seem too boring for me. I was considering Ukraine or Syria but both wars are bullshit. Nothing really worth backing over there.
