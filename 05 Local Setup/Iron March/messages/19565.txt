	We don't delete accounts because it is pointless - your posts will remain except they'll be marked "guest_wewelsburg" and anytime anyone quoted anything you said that'll still be there as well, and even if we could delete all that any cached copy of IM prior to deletion would have all that info intact, so its a stupid request.
