	God is basically Truth. You can't be a fascist without believing in God though at first glance it may seem possible to some I personally think it mostly has to do with the concept of divinity that has been presented today in modern society - as little man in sky who seems to arbitrarily dislike random things - a materialistic view which tries to measure God by human standards.

	Basically each religion is a manifestation of Truth just like National Socialism / Fascism / Legionarism are manifestations of our worldview (note that NS/Fascism were such powerful and influential manifestations that the words themselves are now most often used to refer to our worldview itself rather than the NSAPD specifically). I know this kinda begs the question of "why have both?". I'm not really sure myself but I would assume it has to do with secularism (the separation of the state and church) which killed a lot of the power of religion from a governing aspect along with the fact that religion tends to focus more on the individual's own path to transcendence (the internal struggle). It could also be related to the degeneration of religious institutions.

	It's easy to see which religions are outright falsehoods as they will go against the most basic and obvious truths that can be discerned from simple observation even by children (like race). Most of these have been born in the modern materialist world and usually include all kinds of Christian sects and cults, some pagans and other more autistic ones.

	But which religion is the best/closest manifestation of Truth? Honestly, that question is out of my league and it seems to be a subject that was debated even among the great leaders of the past and is still being debated today. Orthodoxy (and Catholicism according to other people but I don't know anything about it so I can't say) definitely seems to be close enough to not be outright dismissed as falsehood. I know Codreanu was a fascist through and through and if he felt so strongly about Orthodoxy then I am pretty sure there has to be something right about it. Of course even he was still human and could be wrong about certain aspects but I don't think you can make a case for that on this subject.

	I'm not really very knowledgeable about Theology so I can't really go too deep into religious discussions. If you need more info on Christianity I think Akhnaton<span> or <span>Florian Geyer</span> </span>could probably answer.
