	I am not an activist outside telling the people in my vicinity about my political beliefs (because even that is a stretch in today's Marxist world). I enjoy those who will fight the good cause, just not look like a bunch of idiotic skinheads who will fight the opposition when they see them. I haven't heard about the <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> enough to give you a reasonable opinion, but I admire them for their fight.
