<p>What I'm aiming for right now is a group of trustworthy responsible people, ideally if most of you agree then you can pick up the slack for each other as you'll be spread out in various timezones meaning that when someone is away another mod may be present.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Besides the people invited here I have promoted Nat and Zeiger to mods, Nat may or may not be temporary, will see.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Steph I'm promoting you to mod now. I'll wait for answers from other nominees.</p>
