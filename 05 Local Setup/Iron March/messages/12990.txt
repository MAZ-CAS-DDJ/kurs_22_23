	What ever works best, but ensure your members are all ideologically on the same page, you cannot tolerate moderates or cuckservatives. Also never capitulate to allow elements that weaken your group's image into your organisation, don't let fats or piercing covered freaks into it, because it will ruin the image of the movement. Exercise must also be a requirement, it adds group cohesion and it makes the group healthier and more effective as a whole.Â
