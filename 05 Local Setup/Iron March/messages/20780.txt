	I really appreciate that you are trying to get it all tied up and I agree that this is nonsense to a certain extent. But, yet again, we see a very worrying sense of morality: "I dont find it morally reprehensible and neither should we".

	Yes, we shouldn't dwell on the morality of every attack and flood our emotions into it, but this is moral relativism at its finest. Senseless murder, which has been seen as wrong in every age that humanity has existed, is morally wrong. Not the worst thing but that alone is a fundamental fact.

	I wouldn't have any issues if Nick was just another random user of the forum, like VeggieWolf or Bloodeagle, who have/had similar views. But he's not, he's a moderator. And his message is really affecting the newer members, which is my most important point.

	Remember when the younger members would put up stickers and carry out activism in their local area? That's all stopped now, because the hardcore (not legitimate) SIEGE pill is essentially defeatism e.g sit about and wait for the collapse and speed it up by cheering on mass shootings. We don't get any real activists from Europe now. Instead we get edgy American teenagers who create meme threads and post about Columbine.
