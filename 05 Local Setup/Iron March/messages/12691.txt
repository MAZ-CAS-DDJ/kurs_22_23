<p>Ironically I just PMed the reaction guy and he seemed alright, just a little apprehensive.  They're all in southern california.  I'm in the asshole of the state and capital of degeneracy (central california) which is ~7 hours north.  It's very shit being so far away from everything, fam.  Also, they want to communicate strictly over instagram and twitter which to me is just a waste of time.  I'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, how'd you hear that there are feds in the Wolves of Vinland?  I'm not too surprised, but I am disappointed because I was planning on going to one of their meets.  Most militias in the PNW are crawling with county and state police informants, sadly.</p>
