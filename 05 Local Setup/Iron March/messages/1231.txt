<p>If I lived in the USA I would want to move. I have been their and its a nice place <span style="text-decoration:underline;">to visit</span> but I would hate to live there. It is even more cosmopolitan then South Africa. In another 10 years I can see whites being the minority in the USA. In the past they said "by 2050 whites will be the minority." Non-white birthrates and illegal/non-white immigration is at an all time high. The USA as we know it is ruined. In the future I can see the USA being an apartheid regime in which the coloured hordes are separated from whites or would be Balkanised.</p>
<p>How is your Afrikaans? 60% of South African Whites and most pro-White Nationalists speak Afrikaans as a first language. It is my second language and I am 75% Afrikaans. I can't read it but when people speak it I understand most of what they are saying and I can pretty much speak it fluently. If you want to come here you shouyld learn Afrikaans. I would be happy to have more nationalistic socialists here. Most pro-white nationalists here fall into the reactionary crowd. Terre'Blanche(his name means white earth) can be called a reactionary but I would call him consider him a revolutionary that wanted to gain independence and overthrow the current order. He was a good man, RIP. The k4s that killed him should be put to sleep.</p>
<p>The situation here is pretty bad. But one can't really call it that much worse then what is happening in European countries. Here more whites at least have the decency to see the truth. Thousands of whites have been murdered in farm attacks. Whites are victims to black crime. You can read about the crime and atrocities the blacks commit on the internet. South Africa is the crime capital of the world. Whiter areas like the area I live in are like that of first world countries. The difference is black criminals break into peoples homes at nights from poorer areas. There are some upper-class blacks that are more similar to whites in terms of behavior. Still, I am optimistic. I am sure we will win and establish our independent state. I would recommend coming here. Not only will it benefit my nation but I am sure you will benefit as well. What does America offer you? I do not think you can say it offers you much.</p>
