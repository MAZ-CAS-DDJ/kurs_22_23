	Oh hye well I started to really like nature a few weeks ago and I bought some books about survivalism because I think it's a necessary ability that can be very useful in times of danger.I also think that it can be cool if you can go camping by yourself in the woods and experience it like a true man by making everything by yourself.What about you ?
