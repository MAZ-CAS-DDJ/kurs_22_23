			Yes, I have read that Berberism is against Islam, but for me it looks like that they don't like it because of the Arabs. That's still not a reason to reject Islam though; I have worked with Indonesians a few years ago and one of them told me they hate the Arabs but they are completely separating them from Islam. I don't really have a clear opinion regarding this question, since on one hand I see how the Arabs spread with Islam

	t's a VERY complex and hard to understandig question! The word arab , nt meaning only a people/race, but a language. When the berberist uses the word "arabs" it's not the people, the arabic race specificaly, but the arabophones, the people speaking arabe bur pure berbers. For berberist, a pure berber, even blond/blue eyes, is an arab if he speaks arab, and mostly if it's a muslim. In Algeria, the relation is very complicated, for this reason I defend an "arabo-berber and muslim" identity, against niggers, western civilization, jews AND arabs (of the middle east like kuwaitis, quataris and other bastards) , also we despise Iranian chi'ias militant because it's a false religious views in many point and Iran is a natural allies of Israel and Jews ( <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span>despite appearances) , we are alone in Algeria, alone against many peoples. and many dangers. </span></span>

			What do you think? That could be great if they wouldn't be against Islam, a great Alliance of White/Arabic North African countries led by Algeria (with the guidance of the Sufi masters of course). It looks like that Algeria is the most powerful and the largest country in the region. Maybe you could take the lead now that Libya is in ruins.

	You resumed PERFECTLY my dream and my goal, and the dream of Mohamed el Maadi, the only histolrical algerian NS leader, in his book "Afrique du Nord, terre d'histoire" (North Africa, soil of history) A north africa, without niggers, only whites arab-berber et muslim. Whith a sufi religious elite and a unique political Party (NS/Fascist inspired, of course)

			Maybe you don't have a Fascist elite yet, but the situation is not much better here with our Chauvinistic masses. I like Jobbik and Vona because he is against Chauvinism and he is a follower of the Holy Tradition. Strange situation... We have the political movements in Europe but most of us lack the Traditionalism, and you have a lot of Traditionalists but you lack the political movements. That's why it is good that you travel a lot because with this you will have the experience which is needed to start a movement.
