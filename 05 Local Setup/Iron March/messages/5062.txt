<p>I hate linking to anything by Lee Barnes because he is 100% kosher and seems to have gone 100% ass burger, but it's related to our theory that Muslims and Jews are symbiotic groups. Islam is Judaism v3, the Abrahamic religions are all the same shit, the same principles and the same fucking God, they just disagree on details but you always see them unite together at times in history.</p>
<p>I do admittedly like Nick Griffin's new tactic of separating certain sects of Islam from each other for geo-political purposes but still hating on it as a group in the UK; I think his trip to Syria and the interviews he did were really good. I think Griffin's intentions are good but I wouldn't trust him and he is playing a crude game with the Jews and it'll be the end of him when they turn on him.</p>
