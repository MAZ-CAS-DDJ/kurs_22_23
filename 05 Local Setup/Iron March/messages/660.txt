<p>Although I'm interested in the concept of radical (!) corporatism and view it as a good alternative, I put myself in the tradition of Sorelian Revolutionary-Syndicalism (thus Socialism). Ofcourse I combine this with etno-Nationalism and some Fascist ideas. So I don't indentify with the traditional National-Syndicalism of de Rivera, but with the traditional Syndicalism that arose from the labour movement. In fact my belief is that the 21st century asks for a undogmatic review of ideology and strategy - so classic ideological manifestations I see as mere inspirations instead of dogma's or worked out ideologies.</p>
<p>The Black Rat is associated with revolutionary Fascism or Nationalism - it's a sobriquet of leftwing opponents which we adapted as our own. It's traditionally used in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>
