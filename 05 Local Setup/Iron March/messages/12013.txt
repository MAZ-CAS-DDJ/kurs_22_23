<p>No , he's the victorian era british guy that everybody thought was an evil Satan demon summoning guy , but his book focuses on rituals to break the mind from its reality and to be able to receive communication with the other side.</p>

<p>His Book the one I'm reading Magick in Theory and Practice, (note he studied Agrippa and some of the stuff you have he writes in a  more contemporary easier to understand form)</p>

<p>I know Agrippa invokes the Kabbalah because it's "Jewish" because these are christian spiritual forces trying to control demonic ones, which is totally inaccurate ancient spirits cannot be thought of in a christian cosmology it is simply materialized and pseudo paganism, and it doesn't help get one closer to the truth.</p>

<p>This one is by a Finnish Assyriologist professor , he seems to have an excellent point on the kabbalah's origins being Babaylonian/ Assyrian in nature , especially the divine number system etc. </p>

<p>Also I did some of my own research on the history of the pentagram as it is often referred to , found its origins with Pythagoreas the Greek mathematician , he may have seen it well he was studying in Egypt the five pointed star, to him it represented mathematical perfection. Also the Pythagoreans used the letters in greek to spell out Hygeia which is the goddess of health, however her letters in greek spell each one of the four elements as well as the word idea for spirit or the theory of forms.</p>
