<p>the dragons and angels with flaming swords helps too! Yeah i guess youre right about that aspect of the bible. Ive read a few bits of the Apocrypha but nothing too substantial. i liked the part where jesus blows up a snake. as expected of ironmarch's very own pagan zealot ® im more familiar with pagan stuff usually, its been a while since i read biblical texts.</p>
<p>yeah im hoping trump will spark something. hes getting alot more support from the media lately, ive noticed. walks, running, cardio, different stuff. i have a treadmill and basic weight set so i usually work out at home. and yeah! skiing is one of my favorite things to do but I live in a desert lol. dont get to do it much</p>

<p>he might if things REALLY escalated but I kinda doubt it. my other uncle is pretty embarrassingly liberal which is unfortunate since hes the only one besides my grandpa who still speaks fluent german. his first wife was asian, second was mexican and current one is indian. and his main defense for the immigrants in europe is "well its like, theyre already there!"</p>
<p>US education is cancer, really needs to be obliterated and remade before it can be of any use.</p>

<p>5'5" isnt bad! good height for a girl i think. dont worry pretty much everyone is a midget next to me</p>
<p>its those teutonic genes</p>
