	No, it's not a thousand year old nation. Serbs and Croats at the time of their first states were different peoples clearly divide by linguistic element (just like slavs today). During the great assault of the Ottoman Empire into Europe, Croatian population has fled to the safer parts of the Austrian empire leaving Serbs as only slavic peoples in the lands of Slavonia and Dalmatia. The name of Croatia stuck and some few nobles of Croat origin were present, which enabled the Catholic church to begin eradication of the Serbian population in what they deemed their own sphere of influence at the time. Peak of this was in 1900 on "allcroat catholic assembly" where it was declared that all catholics in Slavonia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Bosnia and Hezegovina are Croats. And it was pretty easy from then on to assimilate all catholic Serbs, Italians and others into this new artificial body called Croats.  When Ustashe came to power they had a program in which 1/3 of the Serbian population was to be converted and it proved successful. Children and illiterate peasants were forced into this new identity and their heirs today are Croats.<br />
	The fact is that history recorded forced destruction of Serbs west of river Drina by Vatican, Ustashe and later by Communists. It is a fact that modern day Croats speak Serbian because the language of original Croats was forgotten since they have been wiped away. Their names in mass are classic Serbian names, you have historic figures who declared themselves Croats despite their ancestors were clearly Serbs. <br />
	Original Croats are somewhere in Hungary and Slovakia, local Horvats, not in Croatia.<br /><br />
	I don't really care about Carpathian Basin, there are 3 historic nations of the Balkans that are meant to rule the lands. It was clear since the days of Byzantium.
