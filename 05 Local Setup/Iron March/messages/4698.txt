<p>hey, well, i drew the symbol myself, so it has no official name, but it represents the hermetic phrase "as above, so below", universal balance, and, you could say, the opposition and unity of two forces.</p>
<p>kind of. boyd rice's interpretation of the cross of lorraine has similar meaning and shape, the swords here just add to the unity and opposition aspect.</p>
<p>cheers.</p>

<p>Does it belong to any political ideology, it seems like Your a nilhist.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>no, not political, philosophical perhaps, don't know. a world view that heavily incorporates balance and opposites as a necessary aspect of life. </p>
<p>i basically put nihilist under my ideology because i don't really belong to any ideology. and of course, it depends how you would describe nihilism. </p>
<p>for example, i believe nothing has real value, other than the one we make. i am heavily "subjectivist", i suppose. </p>
<p>anyway universal balance is the only "higher force" or "ideology" i believe in, i guess. life and death, creation and destruction, good and evil, all the same.</p>
<p>by the way, i can guess you are from Norway, and a Christian, who fights for the revival of national identity, how do you explain Christianity as a part of your national identity, and what are your thoughts on revival of Paganism (or at least pagan values and traditions) (i am not attacking, just curious of your thoughts)</p>
<p>p.s. i learned norwegian language a couple years ago, i am not as fluent as before, though, otherwise i would type to you in your own language. was in oslo too, marvelous land.</p>
