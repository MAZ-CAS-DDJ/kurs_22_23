	Lol what a weeb the album is called Pink Season , Pink Life is a track on it
</p>

<p>
	The entire album is absolute master piece and honestly I can say I remember watching Nickelodeon a while back for the hot girls. 
</p>

<p>
	I love "White is Right" of course , Hitler did nothing wrong line was the best.
</p>

<p>
	In "Flex Like David Ike" he says 6 million Jews show me Da proof Hitler never died
</p>

<p>
	I was just listening to it last night lol again its such a change from his first album "Pink Guy" which is released for free awhile back
</p>

<p>
	Oh "We fall again" that's really deep and actually one of his more serious songs he produced , since he alternates between comedy songs and his (Joji) music. If you look up Joji you can hear some of his more serious endeavors he uses the comedy to further his music career.
