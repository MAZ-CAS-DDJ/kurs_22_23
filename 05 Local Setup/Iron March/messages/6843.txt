<p>Dugin is the one-man Russian New Right and it is a fantasy of mine to cut off his beard Peter the Great style, especially so because he in all seriousness claimed at one point that the power of the Russian man is in his beard and we lost to the Chechens in the Chechen wars because they still do circle dancing and we don't.</p>

<p>His 4th political feelz is an atrocity of intellectual gibberish, an attempt to redefine philosophy without actually advancing any idea, the entire book is a bunch of statements that we ought to do things to essentially redefine philosophy but its up to YOU to help HIM do that by establishing a think tank with him for idiotic purposes such as "finding what exists between the object and the subject". I've managed to get only half-way into it and half a stack of notes on how its utter bullshit.</p>

<p>The only value that ever came from him were his translations of some of Evola's works and his earliest articles, such as "Fascism - borderless and red", however he himself practices the sort of philosophic-intellectual mindfuckery that Evola despised, I was at one point invited to work on his "Global Revolution Alliance" news project, I declined because they wanted to portray the Occupy Wallstreet movement as a great thing that has to be supported, and the project itself is done in a pretentious french noir style.</p>

<p>There is no real evidence to him being an advisor to Putin, I expect that to be a western myth about him that is born in part out of the minds of the western Putin lovers who think him to be the savior of the white race. Dugin has his own faculty in the Moscow State University, one of the top premier universities in Russia, however the place is corrupt as fuck, head of the university was friends with Luzhkov the former Moscow Mayor who's been run out for corruption, Dugin's own place in the university was pushed and secured by some asiatic Duma (parliament) member, at least so far as I know.</p>

<p>His book on geopolitics is simply a book on Russian imperialism in the marxist sense of the word and ammounts to a lot of clay grabbing and using bullshit 1984 inspired countries, seeing how his big thing was that the East i.e. Eurasia is the ultimate center of good in the world whereas the Atlantic power i.e. USA is the satanic empire. It's all a load of primitive crap. Yet at the same time he moves emphasis away from Russia as the Motherland to Eurasia being some substitute entity and says Russians must first think of themselves as Orthodox people and not Russians, which I can at most rationalize as him trying to pander to both Russians and non-Russians. Oh and he also said that he supports "blacks" and hates the white civilization as being antihumanist and not hug-boxy enough and the only thing that saves Russia from its decline is that it is not "purely white". As someone who does adhere to Evola's work and puts race and nation first I find that to be utterly disgusting.</p>

<p>If you were to ever see the sort of people he attracts you'd parallel them with yank neckbeards with a monk-ish twist and less fat, with certain exceptions. They are the sort of people who talk about restoring the Dark Ages in the literal fetishist manner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are other elements I could mention but you wouldn't know about them and giving too much background for context will take a while, the short of it is that he is the Russian New Right and as such has all the downsides of the New Right with a Russian twist, but it is still as autistic as the British or the US New Right.</p>
