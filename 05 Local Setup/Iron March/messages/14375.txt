	1. Our situation is really bad. Let's start with emmigration.About 800k Lithuanians left country from 1990 untill 2016 and are still leaving, so most active, pissed and provocative people left to search for a better life. Now we have about 2.9 million people, when we had 3.7 million.

	1.2 We don't have any patriotic or national oriented party in our parlament, all of those liers are leaning towards liberal doctrine. All those people, who people elected are destroying our nation and doing extra, unecessesary reforms to please EU, and EU doesn't care. Poland is a great example, then it stands for it's people. (Not all the times, but it stands with people not against it)

	1.3 We are seeing rise in antifa/anarchists/communists groups. They are getting new members, recruiting, acting and doing a lot of degenerative stuff.

	1.4 We had "pydar" march couple of days ago, so internet was hateing, there was no real protesting power against it. Me and our fascist group would have definetely ruined it, if we wouldn't had problems with police for our banner drop on 9th of May(VE day). I have wrote a bit about it in Fascists' news.

	1.5 We have seen a rise in political movements, who are more or less pro-putin, which makes me worry, because to repeat the annexation of Krym in Lithuania is possible if Russia decides to do that. I wonder how NATO would act. Let's say some Russian troops move in and kill one of the NATO warriors from USA or UK, that might incite world war 3, but Lithuania would fall in couple of hours if Russia moves in, the same would happen to Latvia and Estonia. So we have to choose one of less evils, and I would choose NATO.

	1.5.1 The best scenario for NATO improvement, would be to kick out America, and that would leave us with NATO with only European nations, of course we have to settle conflict with Bosnia, Kosovo, Croatia, Serbia.

	2. About discrimination of polish minority. It's highly exageratted. Let's take an example: "If Lithuanians living in Poland asks for Lithuanian letters in Polish passports, would you agree?". It's more or less a political game for a couple of Polish Politics who are Populists to rise in power through these minorities. I was shauvinist against polish people 2 years ago, while I didin't knew anything about disastrous situation in Europe. But now, I don't feel any hate for those minorities. To summarize struggle of minority: if that minority respects laws and respects rules, there is no need for hate or any other atrocious actions. But if that minority wants some change in law and the majority of population is against it's hard to see how this can end peacefully or with a result there both sides would be happy.
