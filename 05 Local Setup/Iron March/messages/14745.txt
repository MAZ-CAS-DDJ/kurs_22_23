	Seriously What are you majoring in ? I'm majoring in history and I'm in my senior year also am doing college online at Arizona States University even though I live in Georgia. I'm 22. I was thinking about dropping out when I was 20 too that's when I took a semester off and transferred from my retarded low GPA local nigger school to online university.
