	I like Søren Kirkegård. Good stuff. I can highly recommend "Either or" <br />
	The danish peoples party is the very epedemi of living bread politicians. They fester upon the frustration of the people, promising less shit skins, but, in the long run, never deliver, and continue living as plutocratic welfare dukes. <br />
