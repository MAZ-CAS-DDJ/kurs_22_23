<p>I've been preocuppied but yes now I would like to see if you had some suggestions of schools.</p>
<p>I'd prefer something in the Mid-Atlantic Region, but may have to pick something closer in New York (the State not City).</p>
<p>I've tended to do well in areas of History and Literature, Philosopy all that stuff, Military History as well but from this damned internet search engine the only school that sems to have all these things are West Point which im not qualified to enter, hence why I decided on ROTC in the first place.</p>
<p> But I understand it would be a good idea to try and become educated in some hands on skill.</p>
<p>Machine tooling seems interesting, perhaps Gunsmithing?</p>
<p>Not sure where they'd teach that though but i've seen it as an option before. </p>
<p>I'm sure I could make do with a variety of hands on skills though.</p>
