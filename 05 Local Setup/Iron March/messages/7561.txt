<p>Back then American scene was strong, same goes for Western Europe (France, Italy, Britain...). We're where they were at this moment here in Eastern Europe right now, I hope it won't die out here. The good thing here is that nationalists understand that you have to be against the system, it's the legacy of communism and in some cases this mentality goes back to Ottoman occupation where it was considered an ideal to "outsmart the Turk". Unlike in Western Europe/USA we never had even a semi-decent system in last decades and no one really trust the government and system in general. Western Europe had that welfare utopia for a while which turned a lot of people into lazy faggots living boring comfortable lives.</p>
