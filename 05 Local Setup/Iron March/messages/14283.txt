	Yeah, my high school was an "alternative" high school, which basically meant it was a repository for bad goys, garden variety special snowflake faggots, and brown people who weren't good at sports. There was a very small minority of people who were there for actual academic reasons. If you could prove that you weren't a retard, they'd pretty much let you make your own curriculum and after you learned everything they actually had to teach in the first two years, they'd waive your remaining credits and let you get a BA at the local community college for free.

	The most common course people would take there was phlebotomist training, in fact, that's pretty much the only thing the "career counselors" would recommend to people. Now, I'm<em> </em>sure it's a <em>complete coincidence</em>, but the thought of ZOG rewarding the good goyim by <em>literally teaching them how to drain blood out of people</em> makes me chuckle every time I think about it.
