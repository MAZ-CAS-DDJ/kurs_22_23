<p>I relocated to Sk again. Been doing alright here even if im balls deep in gooks and indians.</p>
<p>The idea is more of a meet and greet networking while cleaning out used book stores of marxist, feminists, liberal, etc works and having a few beers around a bonfire of seditious literature.</p>

<p>Perhaps next summer some time. as for a location I have nothing it could be anywhere that we can have a big ol fire.</p>

<p>As for fighting for Kiev I thought more about it and decided that Azov, while awesome is being used as a shield by Kiev's kosher government and will probably be spent like Donbass battalion. I wont die a good goy.</p>
