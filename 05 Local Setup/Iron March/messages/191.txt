<p>Resolved? To be honest, I didn't think I should've gotten it, but warnings work differenly I suppose. It's not a statement, it's a warning, so it can't be taken back. I don't know what can be resolved beyond that, I just don't think I did anything to deserve it is all. Of course what I said can be considered an 'insult' but that's happened plenty of times before, and not just involving myself; and no one was given a 'warning' which is really a punishment in itself. Three and you're out, right?</p>
