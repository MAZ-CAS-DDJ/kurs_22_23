	Steroids' psychological and reproductive effects are pretty bad, from what I've heard. I try not to kneejerk condemn anything I don't know much about, and I can halfway sympathize with the libertarian "any tool that gives someone an edge should be allowed" argument in their favor. But I don't think athletes who use them set a healthy example. Also most of the guys who have ridiculously huge upper bodies way out of proportion to their lower one seem to be chronic steroid users, so if they can cause that... ew.<br /><br />
	I just looked The Golden One up. Very hot body, but he looks like a tool and his hair is ridiculous. I thought mullets went out with the '80s?<br /><br />
	Overall though, I like the (not too chubby; some of them look a bit "sumo wrestler" which I'm not into) powerlifter type best. The body looks more natural, like their muscles come from something like lifting lumber for a living. And if they're willing to accept a normal body fat % instead of looking like a "ripped" Ken-doll, they can take on more muscle mass and look strong/dominant/very-masculine without as much need for steroids. As an example, Vince Urbank's body is pretty perfect.
