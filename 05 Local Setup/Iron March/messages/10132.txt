<p>Herman's Saga</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arminius the Romans called him</p>
<p>Hermann in his fathers tongue</p>
<p>Waded he through sword-storm and forests grim</p>
<p>And battle-stories worthy to be sung</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A slave he was, a thrall to Rome</p>
<p>In shame he served them faithfully</p>
<p>But under grassy knolls no one knows</p>
<p>What wights plan their demise</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Learned he their ways, the forms and tactics</p>
<p>With spirit of Wotan he learned the ways of Mars</p>
<p>Quiet and polite, he strove upwards in rank</p>
<p>Till none trusted more than him</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Balkan wars he proved himself</p>
<p>A warrior worthy of Caesar-king</p>
<p>Trade gift for gift, he gave them victory</p>
<p>Trade lie for lie, he gave them false hope</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Time ran short, the greedy wolf ate</p>
<p>Like Rome's teeth the soldier's marched onward</p>
<p>Feasting on German forests like it had in Gaul</p>
<p>Time ran short, the noble-man planned</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hawk-clever the German thought</p>
<p>His mind as swift as lightning</p>
<p>Went he in secret to his father's tribe</p>
<p>And spoke with the Earl's and Haruskozii many</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Brand kindled brand, for days the Thing lasted</p>
<p>Much mead and ale was drunk</p>
<p>His father's shrines did Hermann pray</p>
<p>For victory and glory</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From across the forests the tribes did come</p>
<p>Tiwazii, Chatti, Bructari, Hauci, Sicambri many</p>
<p>Banners many did fly, god-poles stood tall from many shrines</p>
<p>Old feuds were buried, they became one</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With lies and cleverness Hermann did lead</p>
<p>His former masters astray</p>
<p>Deep into the lake of forests, far too deep</p>
<p>Till I ween that none could pull them out</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Their sandals muddied, their horses tired</p>
<p>They stretched out, like a serpent on forest-ground</p>
<p>Slithered they into Germany</p>
<p>Knowing not what eyes did watch them</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Long their host became, thinner than snake</p>
<p>Hermann knew to strike</p>
<p>Like sword-waves they crashed upon Roman metal</p>
<p>And carved through like eagles</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For 3 days did they battle, long and bloody</p>
<p>Axes stooped, eagles screamed, Harri cried out to their gods</p>
<p>A red day, a spear day, a shield day</p>
<p>Many splinters were made, many swords shattered</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Valkyries flew across the skies, giving madness to men</p>
<p>"Freedom or death!" Cried the Suebians,</p>
<p>Chanted they praises to Thurisaz and Tiwaz</p>
<p>Wodanaz greatest of all, the hanged god gave them gladness in war</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Knew he not victory, Varus in shame</p>
<p>Flung himself upon his sword</p>
<p>Better die with honor, better die with men</p>
<p>Than go home a coward</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The all-father did give victory to Herman</p>
<p>His tribes and people were saved, I ween</p>
<p>Many skulls were nailed, much armor was hacked</p>
<p>Many men hung on sacred trees, many more buried in blessed bogs</p>
<p>The gods were pleased, gift begets gift</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Retreated the children of Mars back to Rome</p>
<p>In gladness did the Germans sing</p>
<p>Till crushed with hammer was Herman's dome</p>
<p>Too much power he wanted, to much did he cling</p>
