<p>Brother, I made a grave mistake of allowing a certain associate of mine to access it through his own computer. His own facebook was under the sway of some virus or something which used it as a proxy to like some irrelevant sites and spread the virus via nefarious private and public messages. The virus immidiately infected my account, and "liked" certain sites which could hurt my IRL reputation, so I have made the decision to close the account until I figured out a way to make it go away.</p>
<p>And I had asked that guy before, "is it safe for you to access my facebook through your own computer" and he assured me that it was perfectly safe. But obviously it was not. But it really was my fault to trust a herald of chaos such as him.</p>
