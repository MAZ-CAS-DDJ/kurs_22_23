<p>I was re-reading our Foum's Charter, and noted how it states twice that we don't support racist and racial superemist ideas and the like, and that we advise those who hold such views to take themselves elsewhere, like Stormfront.</p>
<p>I bring this up because I'm getting a bit concerned about regular forum member Ethno-Nationalist. He has made it clear that his views are inconsistant with the charter, and appears quite intnent on spreading his views throughout the forum.</p>
<p>Why is not required to keep to the the Opposition area?</p>
