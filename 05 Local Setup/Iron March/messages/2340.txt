<p>As Jutta RÃ¼diger said:</p>
<p>"National Socialism is not repeatable as a government. One can take over only the values which we espoused: comradeship, readiness to support one another, bravery, self-discipline, and not least honour and loyalty. Apart from these, each person must find their way alone."</p>
<p>It does not matter to me if a National Socialist is Corporatist or State Socialist, Revolutionary or Reactionary, but only the spirit.</p>
