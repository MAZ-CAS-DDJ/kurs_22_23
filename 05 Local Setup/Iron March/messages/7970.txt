<p>That's awesome man! I had so much trouble in power because at the time I didn't want to gain too much weight, should just gone for the squatters belly!</p>
<p>Weightlifting is really good, totally different animal of a sport. My pr snatch is 92 k (around 205lbs) and clean &amp; jerk is 112 k (246lbs).</p>

<p>I feel like weight gain really helps, especially the squat and bench seem to benefit. In powerlifting it's almost a must if you want to gain a huge amount of strength, especially if you want to do it as fast as possible.Â </p>
<p>I tried snatching 50 kg and missed it haha, could be fun to learn properly though. I tried power-cleans, but never cleaned more than 85 kg, maybe I should implement them some time. Where do you live?</p>
