<p>So my intro topic got locked for some reason, but on the subject at hand...</p>
<p>Haci Bektash Veli was of both Turkish and Iranian descent, the latter making him much more inclined toward the path of Ahlul Bayt. There are many times in his teachings where he gives lessons from the teachings of both Imam Ali (as) and Imam Jafar as-Sadiq (as). Our entire order is filled with symbolism of the Ahlul Bayt and madhab of Imam as-Sadiq (as). The order itself took on a much more Sunni style practice to escape persecution from the Ottomans. There came a time when the Ottomans were killing all followers of the Ahlul Bayt, so the order went into taqiyya in order to survive, even the Naqshbandis that were present in the area at the time started saying that their pir was Abu Bakr in order to escape death.</p>
<p>As for the Alawites, you will find that they recognize him as a saint, but not their fountain of knowledge. Alevis more so acknowledge him as their pir.</p>
<p>If you want any more information on the order, just ask, I can answer questions or at least direct you to more information in the way of sites and pdf books!</p>
