	You have cited another favorite group of mine, Golden Dawn is fantastic. I have read about their view on ecology and agriculture before, and I think that a great start. The Serbs are also doing this - with "Srbska Akcija".

	I am very young as well, 18, but anybody can get up and exercise, improve there life choices, and join the military. Every young man should serve in the Army. Its unfortunate that these activities are no longer pushed for in the most of the Western World and Europe. It should be mandatory everywhere. Computer activism is useless in my opinion. There is too much information on the internet, so a message will always get lost in the noise and be forgotten about. God made man to be strong, and to prevail through struggle. You should be asking yourself everyday: "If I was put in the situation of life and death, would I be able to defend myself?". Imagine niggers or muslims breaking into your house, or invading your country, robbing your people. What is stopping everyone on this forum from slaughtering this subhuman filth? Activism does nothing. I don't believe in Politicians, or protest. I believe in myself, and God. He gave me hands to kill his enemies.
