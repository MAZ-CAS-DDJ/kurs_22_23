<p>Hey Hadit,</p>
<p>This is Blackshirt 13 here. First, I just wanted to thank you for allowing me to add you as a friend as we have a lot in common. I am also making the assumption that you are well read. If so have you read anything by Yukio Mishima? Is he worth the read? I mean I know he had some degenerate and homo tendencies, but he seems to be a strict traditionalist otherwise. So, anyways let me know what you think. Thanks.</p>
<p>Hail,</p>

<p>PS Merry Christmas Kameraden! Oh, and also what does ATWA mean anyways?</p>
