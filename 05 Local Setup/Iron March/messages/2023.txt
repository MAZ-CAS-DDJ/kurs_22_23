<p>Cis is a term for gender roles. If you follow your biological GenderRole, you are 'cisgender' as transgender people say. We find the Transgender lifestyle to be disgusting, so we often troll them XD</p>
<p>As for your other message, I have no problem with Racism in other countries at all as I'm not a member of that country. Other types of Nationalism that wont negatively impact the USA are fine and even preferable in my book. Your opposition to the Blacks and Natives is understandable. I oppose America's Urban Black Culture myself.</p>
