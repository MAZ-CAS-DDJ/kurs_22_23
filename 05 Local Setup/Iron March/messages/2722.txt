<p>Sorry, just sold my laptop the other day, finally got my old desktop fixed yesterday.</p>
<p>Just need to format and install an OS. lol</p>
<p>I will get back to you on Skype probably tomorrow or the day after.</p>
<p>What exactly do you need done? I am decent with web design stuff. I'm not like a master at it though, as I mentioned in the Skype chat last time I was on. If it's like a blog, forum or other small community software like that I could probably just use some pre-made software, set it up and change the design for that. It would cut down on the time it would take to make it by a lot.</p>
