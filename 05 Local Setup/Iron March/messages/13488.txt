	Hello, I don't mean to be a bother so I'll try to make this as short as possible. I would like to ask you a couple of questions regarding your role in National Action.
</p>

<p>
	1st. What were the reasons that led to your involvement in National Action?
</p>

<p>
	2nd. What do you think the future holds for Europe?
</p>

<p>
	3rd. What actions should the british government take towards the ongoing migrant crisis?
</p>

<p>
	I know this might sound like some FBI shit, especially after the recents events that have happened to you. I really just want to hear your personal opinion on this matter. I am doing a project of sorts on several nationalist groups all over Europe and I'd like to hear National Action's side of the story. I would appreciate a reply but I understand if you wish not to.
