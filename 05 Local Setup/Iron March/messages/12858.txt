	I still think you don't quite get this. IronMarch is not a movement, we're a fraternity. We do help form movements but once that's done the movements are their own thing and we just offer help with materials and guidances if asked, so the Atomwaffen is its own movement founded by IM members, rather than an IM group.

	IM Chapters on the other hands are non-movement affiliation groups.

	So which is it that you aim to be, an independent movement or an IM chapter?
