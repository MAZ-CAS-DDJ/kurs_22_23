<p>I apologize for my delay getting back to you, I've had one heck of a busy weekend so far.</p>

<p>I take it your lame-o professor is a Keynesian bafoon, am I right or am I right? Some neoclassicals can be pretty libby too. The problem with the FED is that anytime the government has a monopoly on something they misuse it and when the FED does this (which it always does) it destorys the value of our currency. It does this because it has the power to print money from thin air which causes inflation. Another problem is that the FED always and forever will lower interest rates beyond what the market dictates which causes the boom and bust cycle by encouraging malinvestment which eventually needs to be cleared out of the market.</p>

And what are your thoughts on out-sourcing?</div></blockquote>
<p>Well one the one hand I have a very diviersified asset portfolio in all kinds of different industries The businesses I own outright are involved in construction and the service sector mainly.</p>

<p>Doesn't surprise me one bit. It will always take White folks to know how to run a nation because we're the only race with the brains and the know-how to do it.</p>

<p>Yes 'mam, I surely try to be -just the way my mama raised me.</p>

<p>I'm awful sorry you can't find the time to take a little vacation, but hang in there, the hard work will pay dividends in the end -or at least it should, considering we live under Obamunism, it might just mean that you and I will pay a higher income tax rate soon so the know-nothing bureaucrats can redistribute our wealth the slothful, lazy and dumb.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="312" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>It pisses me off what that beaner said to me in trivial happenings about being poor and hating the poor, I had to clear up I only hate the poor people that don't want to do anything with their lives!</div></blockquote>
<p>I hear ya! You have no idea how many times I've had that very argument with the folks on here. They just don't have the brains to understand what we mean, that's the problem. A lot of these folks are little worker bees themseleves and are just as lazy as the people we criticize.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="312" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Capitalism is meritocratic for a reason if you are smart you work your way up if you're retarded you struggle pure and simple!</div></blockquote>
<p>Amen to that.</p>

<p>No need to apologize! I get just as worked up as you do when having to debate pinkos, Reds, and all them critters who think they can run a economy better than the Capitalist Class operating in a free market.</p>

<p>Not at all, cutie pie.</p>

I need some guidance in my ideology I need to expand it do you think you could tutor me</div></blockquote>
<p>I'd be happy to help! Do you need me to post in there or just give you my 2 cents on the topic? I would be honored to tutor you <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
