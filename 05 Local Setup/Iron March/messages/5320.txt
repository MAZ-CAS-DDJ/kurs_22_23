<p>Can you link to me any information on National Syndicalism? And is there a relationship between NatSynd and Social Credit?</p>
<p>One last question, what is the link between Anarchists and Fascists? Was it syndicalism? I ask because I'm reading a book that talks about the rise of Fascism in Germany, Italy, Britian, and France and in the section on Italy it talks about Anarchists forming their squadrista, all I get out of it is that the Anarchists and Blackshirts both shared a contempt for modern comfort, it never really goes into details. </p>
<p>Help an anti-American yankee out! Especially a yank that works in a factory and is a member of the Steel Worker's Union. </p>
<p>Ciao ciao</p>
