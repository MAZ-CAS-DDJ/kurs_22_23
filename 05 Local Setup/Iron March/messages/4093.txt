<p>Hello, Vlad. First I would like to thank you for the response, and apologize for mine taking so long.</p>
<p>Several keys on my keyboard have suddenly stopped working, so unless I am at my fiancee's house, I am temporarily without of way to even log in to my account at home, unless I do it on my Nintendo Wii, which is troublesome at best.</p>
<p>Now, as far as your reply went, I would hardly consider myself new to politics. I have been politically active since a teenager, firstly as Republican, then gradually my views and opinions countinued to the extreme Right, where they lay today. I belonged to a few minor Nationalist groups, membering a dozen or so members, but it never went anywhere. They never did anything but sit around and talking shit about various minority groups, which is hardly Problem Number 1, as far as I'm concerned. I tried actually making a difference, no matter how little, but they had lazy streaks that wouldn't end. I started a small group myself, we distributed propaganda, patrolled our neighborhood at night, did community service, and became somewhat notorious in our city, making the newspaper on three occasions. Eventually however, their lack of commitment, not to mention severe ideological differences, led to our 'group' having myself as its sole member.</p>
<p>I am not attempting to brag, but I do believe I have done more for my cause than a lot of so-called Nationalists and Fascists I have come across on this forum and others.</p>
<p>That being said, since joining this site, my views have changed/improved, as I have learned much I had not already known, and have come across members that are truly note-worthy, and deserving of respect, such as yourself. I hope to get to know more of people such as yourself, and learn more, by taking advantage of the extensive archive and knowledge of committed members.</p>
<p>As far as being 'too serious' goes, I do understand what you mean, however I do not consider it to always be a bad thing.</p>
<p>I am a serious person, and that reflects in almost all areas of my life. When something is important to me, and nothing is as important to me as my ideology, I treat it gravely, and with the utmost respect.</p>
<p>As I said though, I understand your opinion on it, and I will try to loosen up a bit.</p>
<p>Again, I thank you for taking the time to respond, and I look forward to talking with you more.</p>
<p>With Honour,</p>
<p>JMG</p>
