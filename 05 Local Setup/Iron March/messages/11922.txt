When 'printing' on the dollar bills, are you really just scanning them? Also, what type and strength of tape are you using to hold the money in place? Final question; have you tried feeding them in any sort of machine, such as vending machine yet, with success?</p></div></div></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>You are not scanning them, you are printing on top of the bills themselves (overprinting is the technical term).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I use normal scotch tape to hold them in place, nothing ultra fancy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And last but not least, I have not tried to use it on a vending machine, but I will try.  Most these days use the magnetic strip test to tell, or only read the face side.  I will post results with the vending machine later.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Ok. One last question, regarding printing is what technique you use towards the placement of the images on the bills? The pictures that you posted of them seem to show insane accuracy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I ask about the tape and printing to get an idea if the bills can be undamaged enough to be read by non-human receivers, as people will get the memo to reject certain money faster than a machine would.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Right, then. Thank you.</p>
