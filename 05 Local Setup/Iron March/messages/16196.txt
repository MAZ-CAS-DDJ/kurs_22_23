	The Navy is really lenient with fuck ups, its pretty difficult to get disqualified for behaviour/performance while on course. The Army though is another story, its just as difficult as the American one afaik. In theory, we are doing the same basic training but I've seen it first hand its not the case. We will get kicked off course for 'bullying' which actually means hurting someones feelings. It was actually embarrassing and morale was constantly rock bottom because we are dragging around these 200 pound SJW women who can't do shit and the IC can't kick them off the course while we have to be nice to them to their face and help them out our we all get fucked up. It wasn't easy though, and generally I would say I had a lot of fun. We were in tents in the middle of a forest in Quebec for a few months, loved the food, we had the best instructors, etc etc.

	I never met any US sailors, the only Americans I'm in contact with is an Airborne infantry guy that is currently with a PMC in Afghanistan. I'm trying to network wherever I can though, it always comes in handy to know guys across the world.

	I am very interested in that piece actually. What is the size and what do you want for it?
