	<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial, 'sans-serif';">Boundary – There is a limit to what behaviours organisms may exhibit through conscious exertion and remain within the boundary of Natural Law. An organism that controls its behaviour and surroundings - free will is a part of the human conscious side which generates experience within finite mental and physical potential, makes possible for particular organisms to think and move away from the boundary of Natural Laws which governs reality<strong> and the dynamics of unconsciousness and consciousness of organisms, and materially manifests itself in the patterns and consequences of behaviour.</strong></span>

	<span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial, 'sans-serif';">Longevity - The greater the degree of defilement the greater the consequences are over time, which builds up to a point where it is no longer sustainable and the creature is either biologically compromised, extinct and/or environmental external circumstances changes which brought about conditions for defilement. Likewise, when Natural Laws are respected with external circumstances sufficient for life, a people or organism may last for hundreds and thousands of years by minimizing the manifestation of long-term consequences e.g. weakness, ignorance, self-destructive behaviour and degeneracy. <strong>The laws of Nature are binding on the consequences of behaviour.</strong></span>
