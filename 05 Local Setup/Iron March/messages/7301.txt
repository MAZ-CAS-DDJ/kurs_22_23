<p>like I said, I could see a lot of people changing their minds. It isn't really definitive like that.. a lot of non-Aryans could easily agree with this platform because their minds are less clouded by modernist anti-moral culture. I just wish things had done more normally and I could say my peace without these losers getting the last word. Which, if anything they will take this as their excuse to ban me. I realize some good did come of this, I did nothing wrong and only had the best intentions but they still have to ruin it.</p>
