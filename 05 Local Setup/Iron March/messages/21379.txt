	I eat enough to keep my muscle mass constant as far as I can tell. Endurance is always useful, running is often usefulÂ and the two combined will be essential during and after The Day of the Rope or any SHTF situation. At least that's my thinking, hopefully I'm not very wrong, haha.

	If you lift instead, you still burn and damage a lot of muscle tissue, but over time you become stronger and gain mass.
