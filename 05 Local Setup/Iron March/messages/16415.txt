	Ah yeah just a bit tired for various reasons. Been doing fine otherwise. Not enough time to read lately which sucks, I really miss it. I really wanna get into reading Carl Jung but it'll be difficult as most of his stuff is in German so I'd have to learn a lot of psychological vocab. Should be fun, probably do it next year. You keeping up with Italian or German studies?
