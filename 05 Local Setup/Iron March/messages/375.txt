<p>Just a ton of work and before that looking for work. Everything has steadily picked up, however I still find myself with very little spare time since I tend to be exhausted after I get off. I'm hoping it will only be temporary employment and I can later move on to something that offers a little more flexibility. In six months I'll probably start working a security job, and I still need to go to school. The pay isn't especially great where I'm at either so it makes saving money after paying off debt a bit more difficult, but next week I'll be fully out of debt.</p>
<p>I do plan on an earnest return, I just have to handle some of the stuff going on around me. I'm trying to give input on a number of subjects eright now, but see I've been beaten to the punch by a wide margin. I see a lot has been going on since I was forced into my short vacation, but I do plan on a swift return.</p>

<p>You found work? That's awesome, congrats. There have been some changes but I expect a casual skim of the forums can tell you that. Return when you can.</p>
