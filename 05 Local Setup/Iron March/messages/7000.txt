<p>These are the Catholic-fascist aesthetics I was talking about. Soldiers are from the Home Guards units, some pics are from Habsburg era, the banner with Christ on one side and "Fir das Vaterland" on the other is from the famous battle against the Turks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sisak" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sisak</a> , it was used by Carniolan cavalry which proved decisive in that battle, some cool pics of Catholic images and symbols etc. We were one of the most religious regions in Europe at the time. </p>
