<p>Hey Balder,</p>
<p>This is Blackshirt 13 here. I am writing you because I noticed that you too are a Nietzsche fan. I just wanted to ask if you would recommend Beyond Good and Evil, as I am currently considering buying it. I would really appreciate your opinion. Also, what do you think of someone who wares a shirt with Nietzsche's portrait on the front? No, I don't own such a shirt but I have seen some on ebay and can't seem to decide if it is a good idea or too damn autistic. So once again I would appreciate some feed back. Anyways, sorry to bother you, and I hope you will take the time to write me back.</p>
<p>Hail,</p>
