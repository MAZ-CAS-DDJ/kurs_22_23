	Sick would it be possible for you to organize the meetup? <br />
	I'd be happy to do it but I only just joined the community so if I go around messaging everyone I'll look suss, hence your apprehension in your first message.<br /><br />
	What sort of meetup do we want it to be? <br />
	I would suggest that we have in a public place somewhere in or around the CBD, on a weekday after work hours. We should leave around two weeks for us to plan it and invite everyone one. We should have the meetup sometime after 22/04/2016.<br /><br />
	I was also checking out 8ch.net/meadhall where there's an Australian meetup thread <a href="http://8ch.net/meadhall/res/161.html" rel="external nofollow">http://8ch.net/meadhall/res/161.html </a><br />
	where we could potentially invite some other fascists and get them on IronMarch if they aren't already. There was quite a few Melbourners in the thread.
