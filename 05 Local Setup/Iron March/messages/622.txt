<p>Thankyou for posting the reminder about the charter- ie. that this is not a WN hangout.</p>
<p>I've been a little concerned lately to see the large number of Nazi/NS members joining Iron March. One of the initial reasons I joined this forum was because it was a place I could discuss 'far-right' politics and ideology without having to listen to boneheads drone on about 'niggers'.</p>
<p>It seems that lately almost every other thread lately is either about Nazism or dominated by Nazis. This is unpleasant. I think you know me well enough to know I'm not a delicate type, or in favour of PC language, but the amount of derogatory racism being thrown about lately is also concerning- it turns the forum into a primitive sewer. It's good to see the staff are on top of this trend, or at least aware about it.</p>
<p>Thanks again, and sorry for the long message, but this has been on my mind a bit.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>Thanks for your message. Indeed, I have the feeling that things went a little bit out of control lately, and that we see NS idiocy, racialism, tinfoil ZOG conspiracies and openly racist stuff everywhere - unchallenged. Unfortunately, due to the big amount of activity we have now (which is good), it is impossible to put a Mod behind every poster, but it was time to put a stop to the phenomenon.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned the happy go merry Hitler fan-club has a place in Opposing Views only. And if I was the only one to call the shots they woudn't have a place here at all. But that's another debate.</p>
<p>Best, WiB</p>
