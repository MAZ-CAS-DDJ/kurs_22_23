	at first I thought you said "Chef". Monarchy doesn't stick with me. I do however believe in fuhrerzinship. Leadership as a whole is precious in my eyes and that only specific people should even be regarded to be fit for national leadership. For me monarchy depends too much on the monarchs to the extent that killing them would completely destroy a monarchy. Just like the tsar and his family when the bolsheviks murdered them. Just as nation doesn't die if the state dies, but if the people die.
