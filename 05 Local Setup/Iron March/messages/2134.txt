<p>Pick one.</p>
<p>So at best Mussolini didn't care enough about race to make a decided opinion on it one way or the other. You don't think it is any coincidence that the only time Italian Fascism concerned itself with race was whne it had the Nazi war machine breathing down its neck? Don't want niggers and arabs in your country? Damn, a great way to do that is to go on imperialist campaigns to expand Italy into...fucking Libya and Ethiopia. Yeah, dat pure Med race.</p>
<p>Hitler was a fucking joke and an insecure art-faggot who happened to paint some nice pictures from time to time. If he wasn't so busy sucking Wagner's dick, maybe he would have been able to pragmatically run his country and not launch Europe into the largest war in history. Ironically, one of the few remarks Mussolini made concerning race regarded the fact that Hitler, being a German, was bound to fuck up fascism. It's amazing how right he was.</p>
<p>&gt;Understands Fascist ideology</p>
<p>&gt;Separatist, de facto White nationalist, reactionary</p>
<p>Again, pick one.</p>
<p>Most of the time I am speaking with Joe and Phil, again, people who actually understand what Fascism means and aren't retards. When you all discuss actual Fascist ideology and not "HURRRR BROWN PEOPLE IN MUH COUNTRY" I'll take you seriously. Otherwise you and the overwhelming majority of people here are a joke to me.</p>

<p>Mussolini would disapprove of the current state of affairs that multiracialism has caused. Also, "Nazi war machine"? Maybe Mussolini should have made a strong army, not a shitty one that couldn't take over anywhere they went. I also speak with Joe, quite often, and he agrees with my position even though he doesn't believe in it. Separatism has been parts of Fascism for some time. "De facto White nationalist"? That's funny, as I'm not a WN, and I hate WN ideology with a passion. Reactionary? Not in the slightest, unlike Mussolini I wouldn't sell the country out to Capitalism in certain aspects like he did. You just use these words, but I don't think you know what they mean.  We also complain about "hurr brown people in muh country"? You do know "Muh" is a Racialist meme, right? I guess you never listen to any of our podcasts were we discuss nothing relating to "browns" at all, and Watcher is in on most of the calls(and he's a "brown"). Also, Virgina, nice, the south. Good going.</p>
