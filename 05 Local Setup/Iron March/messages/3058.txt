<p>Protestantism was a rebellion against Christianity, but their mistake was doing so from within it, although I do not think that they had a choice at that point in history.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about the Romans, seeing as how part of my blood hails from such areas. I liked Rome, before it betrayed its own principles. It bloomed like a strong oak, but then, it malformed into a cancer. But then that is to be expected when anything lasts for such a ridiculous number of years. I think we have to be careful to see which Rome we speak of, when addressing them, just as we speak of different Germanies.</p>

Their fear I think is mostly from a subconscious belief in hell and a belief that being anti-christian or anti-christ is something that alienates them from a vast number of Europeans who believe in Revelations.</div></blockquote>
<p>I think that you clarify the situation better than I could have.</p>
<p>Chances are that if they met a Jesus today they'd be disgusted by him.</p>
<p>The thing is that postmodernity forced them to abandon so many things that Christianity is one of the very last few things that they can cling onto. And if they leave it behind, then what? I'd be like them were I in their boots and brains. I think that the main problem is that their interpretation of Christianity is eurocentric and "contaminated" by Aryan-like beliefs, but they say that such is the true Christianity. If I were a christian myself I'd call them heretics.</p>
<p>It is really complex. We could go on like this forever. Too bad we can't do so over a few beers.</p>
<p>Either way I don't mean to tell them what they should believe in. I am the devil's advocate. I just poke at contradictions. They can be Christian or whatever else, I don't mind, but things that contradict themselves, I cannot stand. If I could, I'd just be a democrat.</p>
<p>Nietzsche cries, our next wave of revolutionaries and Ã¼bermenschen decided to carry with them their crosses.</p>
