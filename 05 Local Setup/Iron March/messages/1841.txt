<p>What would the rough percentage be of state control to private corporatised/syndicalised control? I ask because I find it interesting that direct state control would still be pursued as a means of economic planning given its decidedly mixed success in the USSR, which is why I favour the less direct market control of the corporate system.</p>

I have a large amount of respect for the Armed Forces and find it to be the organization which would be the most capable to become the State. It brings order and discipline.

<p>Well, from a perspective of moral character, I'd generally agree with you (although of course this works better when the officers have been raised in a fascist culture already and know their responsibilities). From a more practical perspective, however, the military would lack the expertise to actually run the government. Perhaps the military would serve an overseeing role and leave the details to statesmen?</p>

<p>I'm not sure this is a good idea; having a country policed entirely by soldiers and regular checkpoints on highways creates the perpetual impression of martial law and government mistrust of the populace, a practice more suited to a paranoid and oppressive totalitarian state than a proper authoritarian one.</p>

After 6 or 8 years of service, you're granted access to a higher 'class' that would simply be a citizen with political access, more privileges, etc. I'd have a separate class for those who serve, say, 15-20 years or until retirement, a 'warrior' class.</div></blockquote>
<p>I've always been a fan of this idea, but I always wonder, how would you successfully implement a plan which involves depriving the vast majority of the population of the vote? My solution at present is to keep the universal suffrage (except for severe criminals) and grant <em>additional</em> votes to people deemed exemplary, soldiers being a prime example.</p>
