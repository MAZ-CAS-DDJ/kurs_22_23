<p>I should know this as well, but I find very little information of the role of women in the BUF. I know Mosley supposedly saw them as 'equal', but I always got the feeling that it was said for novelty purposes and that women would have just taken to their natural nurturing roles anyway, much like most women today still do, although you get the odd degenerate.</p>
<p>I mainly want to know what role Mosley hought they should serve in the military, if at all (I certainly don't believe they should be on frontlines or in any combat roles, but certainly taught to defend themselves).</p>
<p>I can't find much in the friends of oswald mosley website about this topic specifically; any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
