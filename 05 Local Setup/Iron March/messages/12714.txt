<p>I would love your prayers, they mean more than anything else. Thank you so much. And let me know what i can pray for for you.</p>
<p>I didn't know you'd travelled to the US! Whereabouts? Our confession line is all the way down the aisle, it can be hours. I was annoyed by that but now I see that it's a blessing. </p>
