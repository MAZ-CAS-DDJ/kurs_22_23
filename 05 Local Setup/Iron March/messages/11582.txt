<p>A ball, blue-ish (well the whole view was blue-ish) ''fuzzy''. I saw from the view of this ball and was in a small castle of sandstone. While I was in the material world still, knowing that ''I was I'', I was somewhere else in ''the soul'' if that makes sense. Again, this was before I went to IM and before I even considered being fascist. All this came afterwards. Not going to go into too many details but it was not a pleasant experiance. This happened as I tried meditation for the first time. Was quite unsure what to make of it at first. I would not be too worried about it being satanic. Impressions from the higher would be reasonable. Perhaps disorderly and hard to understand.</p>

<p>How did you feel when it happened?</p>
