	What you said ^ this is the core of everything that needs to be carefully understood, but because of modern destruction of word's meanings, it is hard for a man to see what it is about. Now listen carefully:<br /><br />
	God is by nature good. He is perfectly good. He created man in His own image. So in the beginning, man was originally perfectly good. But in the garden of Eden, man exercised his free will and disobeyed God which made his nature to become imperfect and evil.<br /><br />
	Now we have a Good God and a bad men. God is the ruler of the entire world, he demands perfection because he himself is perfection. He cannot accept us, since we are imperfect. No matter how many good things a man does, he is still evil in the sight of the all perfect God. God has to bring perfect justice against evil.<br /><br />
	But God is also merciful and full of Love.<br /><br />
	So to fix that, God came into the Earth as a perfect man (<strong>Jesus Christ</strong>) and instead of punishing mankind, he punished himself, because <em><strong>He loved us that much and more</strong></em>.  So now God you see: God can Love us by giving himself as the way to perfect goodness and bring justice against evil by punishing himself for man's evil.<br /><br />
	Do you have any questions?<br />

	Here's one way to start your life as a Christian:<br /><br />
	For you discover more of God's love for you and how much he cares for you, spend time with him every day by praying to him and reading the Bible. You will then grow to love him back more<br />
