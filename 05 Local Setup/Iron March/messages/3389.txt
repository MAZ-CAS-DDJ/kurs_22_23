<p>Best way to deal with them is to bait them and then tip the police off a few months down the line anyway. Back in the day I used to scam a lot, this is one of the things I used to do for money, bait them over a forum or a chat room as a teenage girl and then bribe them. The police may deal with you if they have the balls to go to the police (and trust me, some of them have done it in the past) but the public wouldn't think twice about hounding him if it came out and that's where the threat  of exposure works. It's all about doing it the right way and intimidating him. If you wanted some more tips and details I'd be happy to oblige.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of fascists I'm still not opposed to using 'illegal' means to fund causes, further an ideology or just make an extra penny. The police aren't on our side, even if they want to be, their job is to protect whatever system is in place and toe that line.</p>
<p>Credit card and ID fraud is another area I'm very knowledgable in. I don't do any of this stuff myself anymore since I gained custody of my daughter and the risk of losing her over fraud is too great. The only reason I don't post it on the forum is because I doubt Alex would want illegal activities being discussed on the site, no matter how hypothetical.</p>

<p>I've done the first a couple times myself. I did one a couple months ago, didn't get any cash out of the kid, but he's no on the sex offenders list for life for wanting to fuck a 12 year old. I'm also fine with the more dirty means, we might as well exploit the system and help it fall quicker while making money to fund our other methods of making it fall.</p>
