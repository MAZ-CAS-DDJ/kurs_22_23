	If you want to work for one of the major companies that get regular contracts with the government, yeah, you gotta go union. You can go independent, but the work is largely seasonal, the pay is less, and it doesn't have medical. Or at least it didn't, I don't know how that all works out with Obongocare, probably just means that they keep less people on payroll and pay more Mexicans under the table.
