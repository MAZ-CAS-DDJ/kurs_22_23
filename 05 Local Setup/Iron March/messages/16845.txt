	<span style="font-size:11.5pt;line-height:107%;font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;background:#36393E;">jewish push for nonwhites, why nonwhites are bad, why Australia is a white country (sorry abos), false flag accusations</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:'Adobe Myungjo Std M', serif;">Wew lads.<span>  </span>We’ve been at it again. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:'Adobe Myungjo Std M', serif;">(Insert poster picture here)</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:'Adobe Myungjo Std M', serif;">As any followers of the #</span><span lang="en-us" style="font-family:'MS Gothic';" xml:lang="en-us">‎</span><span style="font-family:'Adobe Myungjo Std M', serif;">gastronomers2016 trend on Facebook would be aware</span><span style="font-family:'Adobe Myungjo Std M', serif;">, a few of our Melbourne lads have caused a bit of a ruckus yet again. A few well-placed posters have resulted in a number of shining examples of Melburnian filth taking to Facebook to exclaim their displeasure.</span></p>
<p></p>


<p align="center" style="text-align:center;">
	<br /><span style="font-family:'Adobe Myungjo Std M', serif;">(Insert Facebook posts with username blanked out)<br /><br />
	Now now.<span>  </span>For all of you newcomers to the site, I am sure you are wondering what the hell we did this for.<span>  </span>It caught the eye and offended people.<span>   </span>In an age filled with a bombardment of instant stimulation where ever you look, only the most eye catching of pieces will really cause people to stop.<br /><br />
	What better way to catch the eye of our enemies than spread something that will render them <i>literally shaking </i>at the sight of it.<span>  </span>It was crass, yes.<span>  </span>It was barbaric, yes.<span>  </span>But it did the job, did it not?<span>  </span>It caught the eye, and spread our name further than a dozen single, moderate posters would have.<br /><br />
	However,<span>  </span>that’s enough talk about that.<span>   </span>We at Antipodean Resistance have had a good laugh the past 24 hours.<span>   </span>Watching uni-students and Melburnian filth alike virtue signalling on Facebook in regards to our posters has made for great entertainment,<span>  </span>but the most interesting portions came from the comments themselves.<br /><br />
	Now, the first thing we found worth discussing was the elitist tone to many of posts and comments left in response to the poster.<span>  </span><br /><br />
	From accusations of ‘inbreeding’ to assertions that we are poor and uneducated,<span>   </span>we can see well and truly just how highly these noxious weeds view themselves. These writhing creatures of cognitive dissidence don’t care about that.<span>  </span>To paraphrase what my colleague wrote in the previous article, <i>hey, who needs a cohesive argument when you’ve got an agenda to push?”</i> These brave warriors of egalitarianism and equality deserve to think of themselves as first amongst equals, because they are fighting for the humanity of refugees and coloured minorities in this nation.<span>  </span><br /><br /><br />
	(<i>Then again,<span>   </span>if I paid tens of thousands of dollars I didn’t have in order to receive a useless qualification in feminist dance therapy, I’d want to at least feel elitist afterwards)</i><br /><br /><br /></span></p>
<p></p>


<p align="center" style="text-align:center;">
	<span style="font-family:'Adobe Myungjo Std M', serif;">Secondly, the non-white response was equally as amusing.<span>  </span>It can be best summed up as a nice combination of simulated anxiety and a few expressions of ‘not in Melbourne!?’ Overall, from the responses we saw on social media towards our little stunt, the non-white reaction can be categorised as smug.<span>  </span>They sit comfortably in their political position, and don’t believe the recent shift in political climate will have any impact on the cushy metropolitan lives, so why should they really fear it?<span>    </span>Oh, they will share it and feign their crocodile tears, knowing that whitey will virtue signal to their defence, but they have no real cause to worry.<span>  </span>Please.<span>  </span>Keep that up.<span>  </span><br /><br />
	Ultimately, the most amusing of all reactions was from our own side, or at least our retarded political cousins. The amount of false flag accusations that we came across in our searching was surprising.<span>  </span>Alt-lightists and civic-zio-patriots alike trying to pin such an obscene piece on Antifa or university socialist activists. From Reddit to Twitter to Facebook,<span>   </span>they are still unwilling to be even remotely associated with anything that doesn’t fit the nice comfortable moderate veneer that the alt-light has tried to paint itself with.<span>  </span>This mindset is a disease to the movement.<span>  </span>The fascist movement must be careful not to adopt the same way of thinking.<span>  </span>We are not populists.<span>  </span>We don’t seek to be palatable, or seek democratic representation.<span>  </span>Conforming to politically correct culture is a death wish.<br /><br />
	Within the nihilistic rave-party of modern degeneracy,<span>  </span>those who wish to be heard my speak louder than all the others.<span>  </span>To do this, we must not alter our beliefs to fit the indoctrinated mindset of the unthinking masses.<br /><br />
	All in all,<span>  </span>this was a productive test. We will use what we have learned well<br /><br />
	See you soon, Australia</span></p>
