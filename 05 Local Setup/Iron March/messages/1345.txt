<p>Even though I believe that you have a long way to go before you truly create a ideology, you have time to develop. I am against Homosexuality and the such, but Heterosexual marriage and love have been the only true couple in European countries since time immemorial. Yet you are an American, where, in our current times, Homosexuality and the such have began to be permitted. American Fascists are usually against such things and I agree with them, but instead of calling yourself a "Syncretic Nationalist", you could call yourself a Neo-American Fascist, the "neo" standing for current American values.</p>
