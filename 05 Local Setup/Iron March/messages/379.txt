<p>Dux,</p>
<p>Sure thing, I will work on getting a channel set up for us. No need to have a server of our own, we can host it on one of the bigger ones. Yeah, I have had a lot of problems with Skype before in the past but it seems to be running well for me now. But I will work on getting that set up today when I have the time.</p>
<p>I'll keep you updated.</p>
