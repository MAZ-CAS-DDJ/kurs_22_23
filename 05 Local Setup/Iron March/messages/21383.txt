	My bike is dumped at my girlfriend's grandparents' cellar, which is 5 minutes from where we live, but I'm a lazy bastard and I'm scared shitless that if I get on the bike I will kill myself within 10 minutes, lol. Downside of not learning to ride it when I was 3 and too stupid to understand danger.

	I hate heat passionately, lol. During summer I can only run or do workout early in the morning. Even at 8-9 pm it is over 25C outside, so no thx.
