	I'm interested in the IM chess club. I already have a lichess account but made another to avoid being doxxed. My new lichess account is Autokrator. I am a mediocre player given that I never read any material on chess and have learned by simply playing. I am a slightly above average atomic player with a rank in the 1800s however. My discord name is Basileus#3280. The IM chess club is a great idea and I'm disappointed I was gone for a while to miss its formation.
