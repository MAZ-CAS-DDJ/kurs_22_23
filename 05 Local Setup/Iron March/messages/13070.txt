	Hello!
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for your response. Very thought provoking. I value the welcome.
</p>

<p>
	I was registered with AFP for years and I did donate also. I still follow them online. But with young children its too much fitting that into life when I have so much to focus on at home. I tried to be politically active and ended up burnt out, stressed, not able to be the mother I wanted to be. So I do my own Nationalism. 
</p>

<p>
	I want a big family. 6+ children. Am going to be homeschooling, I buy food locally from white farmers. I try to buy Aussie made. I encourage others to do pro white things. 
</p>

<p>
	So I am not doing nothing at all. I am busy building a strong family as the basis of our race rebuilt among the ashes to be mentally and physically strong. And so far I think I am doing well. :) 
</p>

<p>
	I would support my husband in any type of pro white thing he wants to do as well even if it puts us out. But maybe when my children are older ill find a new way to do good. I am not a fan of UFP and am wary of most nationalist movements.

	Does not mean I am anti white though. I live for my race.
</p>

<p>
	Cheers

	Keirra!
