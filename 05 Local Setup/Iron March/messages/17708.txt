	Nice. I actually added those replacement meal things (that stuff you poor in milk) to my diet recently. And I also started eating snacks throughout the day since I found out recently that that is actually heather for you and helps prevent binge eating at mealtimes i.e. lunch and supper. Mostly been snacking on granola bars and apples.
