<p>I had a chance to read issues 1-4 of Reaktion, and for the most part quite liked what I saw. Especially "Manifestation of Destiny"... Who wrote that? It was fucking excellent.</p>
<p>Anyways, I don't know if you're looking for contributors to Reaktion right now, but if you are, I'm interested. I have a professional background in illustration and would gladly provide some black and white propaganda if you're interested in it, since I've been sketching up some designs I plan on making fliers to distribute around my home city. Unfortunately being forward deployed right now makes getting scans of the art difficult, so I might not be able to pitch stuff like that until I get back in June.</p>
<p>Aside from that, if there's other content you're seeking, feel free to let me know, and if it sounds like something I can provide, I'll be totally down with it.</p>
