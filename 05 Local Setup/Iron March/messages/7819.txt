<p>Oi, really lovely artwork, really dig it. But there are two things id like to change in the picture. 1st Could you change the suits color to white and ties color to green because this is the official NRM suit code. 2nd Could you change the symbols place to guy right side of the head so its shown fully and pointed up, because when the symbol is used its mostly by pointing up, nothing wrong with the current one but id like to see how it looks this way.</p>

<p>Also could you do something with this picture ? <a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/2c4f8c0f36fad108f587dcf3a27c2957/tumblr_n0s6t1Ye3U1s4ye62o1_400.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://24.media.tumblr.com/2c4f8c0f36fad108f587dcf3a27c2957/tumblr_n0s6t1Ye3U1s4ye62o1_400.jpg</a>Like if you can, change the colors to NRM colors (Green.white) and replace the symbol with NRM logo. </p>
