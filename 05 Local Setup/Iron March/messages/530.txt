<p>I looked for that quote and through some research I have only found the Nuremberg speech in which Hitler says to the youth he wants a society without ranks or classes. I believe the site has a misquote. </p>
<p>No worries though, glad to see it was corrected. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
