<p>Thanks. I've made a note of your threads, and I'm reading through your work. Looks impressive so far.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And cheers for the Protonmail rec. We've been using Hushmail and Safe-mail so far. We knew they were flawed, but were stumped for a superior alternative.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I do like the simplicity of CryptoCat. Also the fact that it links up with facebook, and let's you chat anonymously through that. Just one step removed from what the average person is doing already.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, in one thread you mentioned your desire to help the Nordic Resistance Movement. Well NA has links with the Finnish branch of the NRM; so we <em>might</em> be able to put you in touch with them <em>if it's deemed appropriate</em>. But just get to know <em>us</em> first. And on that note, I was thinking: I could connect you up with your local - Leeds-based - organiser, like I said. Or <em>I</em> could meet you in Manchester. It's up to you mate.</p>

<p>Chris.</p>
