<p>Peoples reactions towards GD social welfare actions (blood donating for Greeks, food and clothing sheltering) are mixed. Many people see us as a true vanguard defending their rights and helping them and libtards see us as malevolent crooks using nice-appealing strategies, so to "enslave" people, and as criminals substituting the State and the "democratic institutions". There was a big issue about the blood donation, with libtards whining about how evil and unethical that action was, and how it promoted....the evil idea of "racial purity"!!!</p>
