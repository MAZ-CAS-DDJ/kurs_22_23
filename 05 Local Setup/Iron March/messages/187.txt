<p>The topic was about getting to know me, and because I am new, I thought it fitted in quite well, especially as my last 'introduction' got split into a Traditionalist and a WWII thread. I haven't explored the full depths of this group as I have been a member for just two and a half days, surely such junior members cannot face the same penalty as an established and somewhat esteemed member.</p>
<p>I am not arguing with you Rux, but would you point out exactly what I have said that breaks community guidelines? Just for future reference of course, so I do not make the same 'mistakes' again. As far as I can see I have not used any vulgar language, and only insulted Vladimir after he crudely insulted me, even then I kept explicit and offensive language to a minimum.</p>
