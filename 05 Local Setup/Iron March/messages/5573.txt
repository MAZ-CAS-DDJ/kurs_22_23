<p>I wasn't mad about that, that's not even his real name(and I've known it since he told Ben a day after we thought it was that). I just thought the penis joke on the forum was a bit stupid, the whole thing was and I even said Alex was too then. I sent Alex a message asking him to remove it. We just wanted to share the things. Honestly, it's not all that bad. Everyone has family that gets DUIs all the time, a lot of mine does. Honestly I was just most amused by the child picture of you, ask Ben. That's what I loved the most. The Jamal kid's bitch beating you was just a bit funny for like 3 minutes then it was dull.</p>
