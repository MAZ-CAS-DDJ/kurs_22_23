<p>Do you watch Tommy Sotomayor? </p>
<p>If you do not know who he is... Go on YouTube, and enjoy. </p>
<p>He is an atheist, and I have heard him time to time be vaguely sympathetic with homosexuals (though usually he does make fun of them and question them), but really... </p>
<p>I have never heard a black man talk about the failures of black culture that candidly, nor have I ever heard someone come up with better possible solutions, and a more realistic view of the situation. </p>
<p>I am interested in your opinon.</p>
