<p>Succesfull becouse the crisis the greeks have not developed the "national idea" like other nations they lived with some dreams of East Roman Empire who was geate and developed and migthy and shits like that but they dont made an account that they DONT BUILD IT the Romans build it. . Why do you think they have such strong "left wing" organizations ? Do you be in Greece ? They are not homogenic people, those of them who live in the isles have verry diferent features than those in mainlend and have bad opinion on them some of them dont even call them "Greek" not Helenics wich is insult when one Greek told it to another  . We watch them close also here in BG  but the reason is diferent. Otherwise even if they win the elections how do you think they will battle the crisis. There is no way that will happen in next 30 years in now condition in Greece  the true is that they were fucked by their allies who 60 years who "Tap" money that the Greece can succesfully opose the "Eastern Block" but now when there is no "Eastern Block" and the jews  star to fuck and rob them like everyone else...</p>
<p>So dont expect they will create something great Fascist State that will be an example for others becouse they wont.</p>
<p>Well i maybe not unprejudiced at all but dont expect more from someone who invent "Faggotry and Pedophilia" <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
