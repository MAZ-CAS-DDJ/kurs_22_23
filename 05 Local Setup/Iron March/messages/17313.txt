	Not entirely leftist, but what does it matter if the it is not leftist dominated? They will just sneak right back in, jewish interests are carried by leftists of which thrive in democracies. The fact is that the traditional thought of democracy is dead, and there are literally no countries in the world who even practise TRADITIONAL democratic processes due to how inferior the nation would be compared to lets say an autocracy(what leftists and moderates call a dictatorship) The fact is that a fascist state can't be a democracy, and can't have tolerance for private interest based ideologies and political interests within our nations. The structure of the government doesn't have to be a hitler or mussolini like system but must adhere to truth and natural law and order. That is fascism. However i personally think a more hitler or autocratic leadership would be favorable in pursuit of the national leadership serving a greater and higher purpose. Leadership is precious.

	Even though he has a Jewish daughter who "converted" along with countless other jewish politicians within the back scenes. I do give the man credit, but ultimately he is no friend of fascism when it comes to the policies and spirit of the nation. The fact he is idealized by the autist right scares me.

Democracy leaves power to the majority while epistocracy allocates power to the knowledgeable. Jones did not imply that democracy should be eliminated, but lessened by 10% for the sake of long term economic growth.</span> . From what i have looked at epistocracy just seems like intellectualized democracy with an intelligent based leadership. Sounds like a shit system. Unless we wipe off the autism the alt right brings, them getting success will not bring fascism to our nations. I am a bit cynical when it comes to the alt right and such.

	It's surely better than defeatism, but I honestly believe a true victory is with nothing other than fascism. there is no hope for the world without it, and we will fight for it because it is true and right.
