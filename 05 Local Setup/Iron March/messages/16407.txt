	Do Iron March members still gather to talk on Skype? My email is skl92@tutanota.com and my name is Stephen Lawrence. Is that all the information you need to find me on Skype? By the way, are there more Iron March Skype podcasts? I ask because I have listened to all the podcasts on Ironskype. I thought all were enlightening.
