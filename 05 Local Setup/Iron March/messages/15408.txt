	My mom is from Poland and my dad is Irish-American. I know a very decent amount of Polish because I was raised mostly by my mother, and my Babunia i Dziadzio. I also attended Polish mass as a child and was baptized at a Polish church.

	Besides my own personal history, I'd like to discuss laws in Poland, Religion, Militancy, and general politics if that's ok with you. I actually plan to move to Poland after I serve in the Marine Corp. I am interested in Paramilitary and survivalism, as well as training my fellow Polish brothers.
