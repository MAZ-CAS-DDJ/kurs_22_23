<p>Dobro jutro, and sorry for the late reply, they keep me on a short chain around here. I used to speak Spanish at home with my father, and I studied it for 2 years in school, so now that shall come in useful! I'm agreed, language is absolutely integral to culture. And since it takes a while it's often the last place a person is inclined to start. I am always joking with my family that I will stop speaking English entirely and push them to become multi-lingual <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> Oh, Slav fights! Heh, I look forward to it!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And what? Of course I know Thompson! he's a good one. I have a couple old memories with drunk uncles singing Bojna Čavoglave around a campfire, heh heh.</p>
<p>Oh, the Pacific Northwest! Well, it is up to the neck in faggotry. My state, Washington, just legalized 'gay marriage' last year and it's gotten worse since then. A real disgusting experience. But I will not bore you with that, the land is beautiful. <img height="213" src="<___base_url___>/index.php?ui=2&amp;ik=d7bd714ded&amp;view=fimg&amp;th=141912ed5f0a34d7&amp;attid=0.0&amp;disp=inline&amp;safe=1&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ89tkR2R9uPcRgV2rP8vj29Lbl7nurLsY3vFy8clk7tPU0FJUe4uyqR9SziwsXqXLOLcagc-x1C6NXkBW7vxIKF5Ldl-rloRyJUJx0zO1BUVnMHMhB8p6EQXls&amp;ats=1401720460332&amp;rm=141912ed5f0a34d7&amp;zw&amp;sz=w707-h213" width="284" alt="index.php?ui=2&amp;ik=d7bd714ded&amp;view=fimg&amp;t" />That is the view from the seawall in my town. A walk through the forest and you come to the shore, with big trees hanging over the water and a view of the mountains. Do you hike much?<br /><br />I would love to visit Croatia! I do plan to visit, not just hop on a one-way plane <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> I've family in Zagorje/Podravina. That beach is beautiful. I used to think all the photos with blue water were photo-shopped because the sea is black here. Ever go fishing?<br /> </p>
