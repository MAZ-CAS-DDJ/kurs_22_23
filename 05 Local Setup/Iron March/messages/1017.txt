<p>I think I caused a lot of strife in the anti-intelectualism thread. It seems to be seen as me calling people out. As an unbiased observer, is that how it looks? </p>
<p>I was nearly trying to suggest that those people who advocate fascism, an inherently action oriented philosophy, should simply check themselves from time to time, asking what they do to push fascism forward. Apparently, that is a firebrand question.</p>
<p>That was also sent to a friend on here. I sincerely don't mean to call members out, as I feel there is nothing to call out on, or call to. If I have enraged the adminship, feel free to delete my posts, or censure me if deemed appropriate. This isn't a demacracy after all. I was trying to help, that's all.</p>
