<p>Yeah I don't have the build to pull that one off(yet). I just usually wear band shirts and the like.  I can't go blatant cause I can get kicked out of college or fired from my job.  But I wore this in class and talked about Rockwell. Nobody caught onto anything. I'm either really subtle or they are just all very dumb. </p>
