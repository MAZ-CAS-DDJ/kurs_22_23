<p>Ah, well, thank you! I'm just thankful to be able to find work. On the boat docks, I unload luggage and supplies. Picking things up and putting them down, makes good use of my talents xD And the youth come up from the State Conservation Corps, we just teach them about the forest, the different plants you can eat, how to cut down trees, things like that. It's a nice job, and when they don't have kids up in the woods, my job is to cut the dead woods out of the trees, which is not bad either.<br /><br />Your work is a receptionist now, if I am correct?</p>
