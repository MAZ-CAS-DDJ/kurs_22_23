<p>Yeah, don't worry about. I'll be slightly busy this week, anyways. Homework and the projects are intensifying, because summer break is almost here.<br /><br />Yeah, a lot of the former communists here were anarchists and non-Trotskyite Marxist-Leninists. The owner of this website when I used to talk to him loved the shit out of Stalin. Dig through his posting history, because he goes over Russian history pretty thoroughly even if it's ideologically biased.<br /><br />I'm close friends with some of the people on here, so I can introduce you to some cool people on Skype. They're nice people for the most part, but some are on the crazy side (at least for my own sake).<br />Â </p>
<p>If you don't mind me asking you, how old are you?</p>
