	For me it depends on where I run. There is a track near the city Zoo, partially forested, pretty neat considering where I live. It's pretty good, but it's only 1,8km long and it would indeed get boring for very long runs. Yesterday about 13km was in the forest near and behind the Zoo, the rest were from the city to the Zoo and back. No headphones though, wouldn't want to get attacked by dogs or gypsies and not even notice before it's too late.

	I'd go to the gym too but the cheapest one is quite far, the closest one is still time consuming to get to, it's expensive and always full of sweaty, smelly people. Wasting an hour jut to go to the gym and back is too much for me, I just train at home, which sadly isn't enough to build huge muscles. I have the same objectives, become a bit bigger (though I have to fight my genes to do that), and lose those 2-3 kgs of proto-bellyfat lol! Good thing you reminded me of rope jumping, I have one but haven't used it for months... it was too hot outside, but maybe I'll start jumping in the mornings before work (it is too cold and dark now to go running at 5am sadly). I have a bike but I can barely ride it, most 5 year-olds are way better at it lol. I suck at sports... trying to at least partially fix it after 20 wasted years.
