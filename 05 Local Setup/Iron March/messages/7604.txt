<p>Hey mate.<br /><br />Cheers for pointing me to the drug thread. Kicking myself I missed that back in the day.<br /><br />Wanna post more on this when I become active, but I'm glad there's awareness here now that we should be making use of psychedelics in the same ways the left/hippy counterculture did in the 60s. Jerry Rubin used to call the Yippies "psychedelic Bolsheviks"- I wanted to coin the term "psychedelic Blackshirts", but looks like you guys beat me to it. The fash shouldn't be a bunch of uptight squares.</p>
