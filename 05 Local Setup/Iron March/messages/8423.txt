<p>I had some questions about these matters. First off, I looked into Agrippa after you mentioned him in the law of silence thread. He wrote a book about the superiority of women and also (from what I read on Wikipedia) believed in the Christian God (which I personally don't care about, but it seems like some of the things he was saying would directly oppose that, like the use of magic, which Christianity classifies as a sin). Therefore I wanted to ask, is he a valid source or someone you think just has salvageable elements. And further more, seeing as how you claim to have done such extensive research, and waded through shit to find the gold, what would you personally recommend for someone who's looking to make the same pursuit, reading materials or just advice in general, and also what materials should be avoided? Thanks for your time, hope to hear back soon. </p>
