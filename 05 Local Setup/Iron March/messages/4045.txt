<p>I can't say I'm a big supporter of monarchy, especially in the midwestern united states so I can't imagine me working with them. I am a strict Republican Fascist/NS.</p>
<p>I do understand, as I go through this process of political depression all the time.  We will always be a minority, so we need to find a vehicle where that can work to our benefit, most of all, us like minded Americans need to work together and set goals for one another to get something, anything, started.  You do have Reaktion and that's a start.</p>
