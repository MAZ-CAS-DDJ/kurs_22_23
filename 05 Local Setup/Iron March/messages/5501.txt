<p>Thanks for thinking this over.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Will keep the same, at least for the time being.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now we need to invite people to join.  I imagine you have name &amp; ink reference to some of the 50 odd who like your American Blackshirts fb page: can you invite them to join - or simply add them to the closed page members and see if they accept the invite.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A glance at your personal fb page suggests you also have several fascist supporters some who might welcome a closed page to discuss the subject and with luck take it further (with or without some prodding).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please let me know. </p>
