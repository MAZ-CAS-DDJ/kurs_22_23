<p>Rockwell's definitely clarifying it for me in a way I haven't ever encountered before. I came to this side of politics as a disillusioned leftist, via Mosley. BUF material resonates with ex-leftists I think because it's heavily focused on socialistic economics, but that's problematic too. Been a long time since I've read any BUF stuff but I remember it having a strong slant on policies, programs, the structure of the corporate state- not stuff that really distills the worldview in a way that's completely accessible for newcomers. Which is why for me I think I originally got sidetracked into thinking of fascism as another artificial political/economic system, rather than a kind of all-encompassing natural philosophy that's just manifested itself &amp; been applied in different forms in different nations. Though that mistake is ultimately down to me rather than Mosley, who was a great man.</p>

<p>Embarassing too that I thought fascism could be divorced from racism, when racism is a totally integral aspect of it. Coming back to racism has been a big thing for me- I'm an Aussie, from a nationalist-leaning family, and grew up in a small rural city that was 100% white during my childhood apart from the abos, who weren't really part of the community anyway. Realising that racism was an integral part of the culture I was raised in, is a biological fact of nature rather than some artificial expression of 'blind hate', <em>and that none of this is a bad thing</em>, has been awesome for me, like coming back to reality. This is actually my third time attempt at reading Mein Kampf, and this time it's coming far more naturally- which partly reflects what you've said. Once you have a more solid handle on the context, you don't immediately reject it out of hand or flat out fail to understand it. Still a challenging book on many levels though. I'm sure a reread once I've become politically active will put it in a whole new light yet again.</p>

<p>Finally, tbh that fact about Hitler doesn't surprise me at all, all you have to do is compare the success/influence of the radically active National Action with the efforts of someone like Robert Edwards and his one-man newspaper-publishing operation to see what closed clubbiness and moderation accomplishes (sweet fuck all for the pointless European Socialist Action). Hitler clearly knew the score and it showed in the way he transformed Drexler's DAP. Anyway, that's me. Know this was a big read, bits'll probably get repurposed for my eventual reintro thread, but I've been mulling over all this for a long time. Feel free to shoot me any other suggestions when you like, I grabbed a whole heap of shit from the Fascists Archive but direction is always helpful.</p>
