	I have also heard that gun laws are becoming less stricter? I know a guy in Warszawa who just bought a 9mm. He said by taking lessons he was able to obtain it. I might have problems though as I still need to get my Polish citizenship after my military service. I just want to make it as easy as possible before applying for things like guns or land ownership.
