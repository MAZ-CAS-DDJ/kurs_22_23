<p>Greetings from Greece brother.</p>
<p>I see you are Romanian and I would like to ask you something as i'm making a research about the Iron Guard. I witnessed some Greek surnames on the names list of the Iron Guard. They are most possibly Vlachs, but I was wondering if there was a strain of sympathizers among the Greek community towards the Iron Guard. Not members but sympathizers netherless. For instance I know that an Iron Guard delegation was sent in a meeting with the northern-greece based greek nationalist organization, the National Union of Greece. Anyway, if you have any relevant or something to refute this estimation i would be happy to hear it.</p>

<p>The 'Greek' surnames are Aromanian surnames. As I'm sure you know, the Aromanian community was(and is) divided mostly between pro-Hellenists and pro-Romanians. Those of a pro-Romanian persuasion were vocal nationalists and a good chunk of them joined the Iron Guard.</p>

<p>From ''For My Legionaires'':</p>
<p>''As a consequence of these two warnings my relationship with Mr. Vaida was ended. Mr. Vaida became angry with me, but I could not proceed otherwise than as my conscience dictated. Summoned again before the same judge, I was arrested. So there I was again in the Black Maria headed for the Vacaresti prison, There were seven other youths in the same van, to whom I introduced myself: Papanace, Caranica, Pihu, Mamali, Anton Ciumeti, Ficata and Ghetea. They issued a declaration of soIidarity with Beza, I walked again under the same gates as seven years earlier with my old comrades, and by coincidence I was placed in the same cell I occupied then. I entered the church the next day to view St. Michael's icon from which we started but children seven years before.</p>
<div>There in prison I got to know well these Aromanians who came from the mountains of Pind. They exhibited a high culture, sound moral health, were good patriots, built to be fighters and heroes and willing to sacrifice. There I came to know better the great tragedy of the Macedo-Romanians, this Romanian branch which for thousands of years, alone and isolated in its mountains, has defended-weapons in hand-its language, nationality and freedom.</div>
<div>It was then that I met Sterie Ciumeti* whom God has chosen for his good soul, pure as dew, to become through his tragic torture and death, the greatest martyr of the legionary movement, of legionary Romania.</div>
<div>There, our thought and hearts united forever. Henceforth we would fight together for our whole people from Pind to beyond the Dniester.''</div>
