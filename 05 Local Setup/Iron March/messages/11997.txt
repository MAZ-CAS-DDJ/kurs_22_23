<p>Alright, so you don't hold my past against me? And you believe that I am a Fascist? I was always afraid that the far-right would deny me because of my past. Also, truth be told I am more into strategy and rpg games too. Also, I wont even touch a World War 2 game if I can't play as the Germans.Â </p>
