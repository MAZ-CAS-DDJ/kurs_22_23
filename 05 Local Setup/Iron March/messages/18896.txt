	Yeah and the Mexicans with their kids playing in the Church while the women look like prostitutes and the men look like gangbangers didn't help either, by me the Mexicans dress in suits and take the mass seriously but god damn I didn't know it was that bad with liberal Catholicism. Yeah Easter is literally a consumer holiday like everything else, I bet if they could commercialize Lent more than just a sandwich (Filet o Fish) than they would do it. Americanized Western "Christianity" is literally just another add on to the world's largest mall that is the United States.
