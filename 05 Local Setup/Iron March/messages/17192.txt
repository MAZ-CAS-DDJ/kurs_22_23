			So? We will commit genocide if need be, for it to be ours again. We liberated our lands once, we will do it again. The land is marked as Serbian by our graves and our sanctities.  Soked with our blood.

	Yes, and it will be soaked by theirs after the genocide against them, thus creating the same claim you are referring to now. There was an old Szekler saying on the Romanian colonization after Trianon: "those who can show me the grave of their grandfather here, can stay" - but this applies to recolonization too. You won't find much land soaked by only Serbian blood - also remember that most of the blood always comes from lemmings. This kind of legitimacy is weak and a lot of people said back in the XIX. century that the only thing nation states can give us in Eastern Europe is destabilization since local peoples were constantly migrated between different areas thus leaving us without clear ethnic borders. We can only have Justice through a common authority and its hierarchical order of the historical/ethnic/geographical/etc. perspectives of ours. Without this our region will be a fucking playground of outer powers for the upcoming centuries.

<p>
	True, but doesn't the same applies to Hungary as well? I mean, ethnic and national perspectives aren't that old. Before the XIX. century every soul would count as a Hungarian who lived in the territory of the Kingdom. We should make a detailed comparison between our history sometime.

	Could you elaborate on this? Sounds more interesting and fundamental than the ethnic viewpoint.
