	Haha, yeah I hear that. I am just starting to think though that if I leave it completely up to fate, I'll just die alone because so far so fate has really screwed meÂ in that area. Almost 23 and have never had a girlfriend. So, I figure I got to make some changes and be more outgoing, of course it also doesn't help that 90% of the time people have no idea what I am talking about. Eh, you probably think I am pathetic don't you? So, I figure it might be worth a shot to pray to Freya, if only to hold out hope.
