<p>No, I'm not autistic, everyone has a position on the autistic spectrum. My point why I loved Hitler was ideological ones (especially eugenics) as explained before, Britain declared war on Germany, not the other way around, so of course he would attack back. It's like me admiring Napoleon because of his military skill, but then you say I shouldn't as he was an enemy of Britain.</p>
