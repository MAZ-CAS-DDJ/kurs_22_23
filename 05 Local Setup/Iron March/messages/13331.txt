	I redacted the post on Judas Watch, because googling Judas Watch would directly bring up this forum.
</p>

<p>
	The site is intended for a "normie audience" so this is counter productive.
</p>

<p>
	It also destroys the entire plausible deniabilityÂ / satire angle of the project,
</p>

<p>
	because it makes the true intent quite clear.
</p>

<p>
	It might be helpful to clearly label the subforums that are public as being public?
</p>

<p>
	You are absolutely right in that nothing should be stated here that I wouldn't state publicly.
</p>

<p>
	I'm mainly concered about the "trail" that my project (Judas Watch) leaves behind,
</p>

<p>
	as I want it to appear neutral and unrelated to any WN etc. cause... if that makes sense.
</p>

<p>
	I re-read my intro post just now and I think it can remain as it is.
</p>

<p>
	Was just getting a little paranoid seeing all that google spits out when I search my username...
</p>

<p>
	Thanks mate!
