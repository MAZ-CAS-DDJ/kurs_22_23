	I don't know much about those, but since our Traditionalists are always talking about the importance of understanding at least the basics of those teachings I would say yes. Mind that this is just my crude simplification but I see it as God is the only one who truly exists (or rather, He is pure existence; while we are only 'constantly becoming' He just is), and our personalities are illusions separating us from Him by creating false identities. Until the Unio Mystica after death we are part of the falsehoods we are fighting against. Egoism and Solipsism as people are using this word today means the belief that this false identity is the highest being, but true Solipsism tries to get rid of it to transcend towards God - so it's incompatible with Atheism.
