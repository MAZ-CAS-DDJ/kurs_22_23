<p>funny enough the liberals in my country almost never mention gays being killed in the middle east. they dont give a flying shit because it doesnt fit in with their liberal narrative. they put more effort into harrassing baking shops because they wouldnt bake a wedding cake for a fag marriage. its a wonder leftism hasnt eaten itself alive already</p>

<p>sweet fuck theyre like niggers, jews and arabs all formed into one entity. those old men up on the balconies look like vultures searching for prey. </p>

<p>yeah shits getting weird in this country, and the worst thing is that no one cares. oooooh we get to change our facebook picture to fag rainbows, so shiny and tolerant!!!1</p>
<p>rome is burning down to an ember and I don't fucking care anymore, the barbarians can come crashing down already, it would be a nice change of events. </p>

<p>I think the point where I realized that America was completely lost was that shirt bullshit. right after we started putting troops next to the russian border and passed new trade laws, this thing on facebook blew up for a week about a picture of a shirt. and people were debating whether it was blue and white or gold and black. it was the top news story FOR A WEEK on every website you could find. every fucking facebook post was about it. there were articles explaining the science behind why no one agrees what color it is. </p>
<p>I wish I could fucking make something like that up, 20 years ago that would have been a great skit on Saturday Night Live </p>
<p> </p>
<p>these fucking fools deserve everything coming to them, I live in a country where people would rather debate what color the sky is than why our economy is failing and why multiculturalism is failing. </p>
