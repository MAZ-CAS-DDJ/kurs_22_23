	Funny. The only time I've ever been to a prison was to tour an ACI Facility with a friend who worked there. We just walked by the cells and laughed at the niggers. I guess the two of us are on the opposite ends of society in a sense. I assume you don't like cops. My record is clean as a whistle and I'm friends with the police. Most of my revenue goes into equipment for myself and my group. The more money I make, the better. I'm not the type of person to show up at rallies or brawls. I don't need the attention. I don't see things that way. But if the instance in where we have a RaHoWa or some shit, I'm going to be a niggers worst nightmare.
