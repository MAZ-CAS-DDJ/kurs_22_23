<p>Hey, I saw this sticker in a local city and was wondering if you could translate for me? It's in North Scotland so I thought it was pretty cool that we have Russian fascists here. (The scraped off part was a sunwheel originally but I never had a camera the first time I passed it)</p>
<p>Thanks. </p>
