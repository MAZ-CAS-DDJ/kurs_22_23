<p>I noticed you describe yourself now as a National Anarcho-Syndicalist. Setting aside the interesting debates this is going to cause, exactly what sort of governmental structure would this imply?</p>

<p>Yes, I realized the need to stop identifying as a "Strasserite" due to the fact that I am an American and not only are such ideas virtually unknown to 90% of European-Americans but I don't think National Socialism the way Strasser explained it would work exactly the way it was supposed to here (even though a great deal of my inspiration still comes from Otto Strasser). </p>
<p>So, I naturally redefined myself as a National-Anarcho-Syndicalist. I would imagine this would combine the best aspects of Strasserite National Socialism as well as Else Christensen's National-Anarcho-Syndicalism. If you are not familiar with Else Christensen she was one of the most important people in the revival of the folkish religion Odinism (which I practice). She was also heavily involved in the Syndicalist labor movement and advocated a very decentralized form of National Syndicalism, in which syndicates, unions, cooperatives, etc etc (all just different names for the same things) manage businesses on a local level. I'd imagine it working like Strasser's factory fellowship only, and I have hinted at this before, the numbers would be a little different. </p>
<p>As for Government, I believe it would also look like a return to an estates system and natural democracy, rather than parliamentarism, as advocated by many conservative revolutionaries as well as Otto Strasser. Instead of federalized, it would be a confederation and much less centralized in order to meet the racial, cultural, and geographic diversity here in the USA. People would be encouraged to organize themselves in their own communities based on ethnic interests or otherwise. All communities within the confederacy would be respectful of each other's self determination and cooperate. I think a constitution would be necessary in this respect. It is anarchist in the sense that, it isn't centralized and people aren't forced to make decisions they would otherwise not want to. If one does not wish to abide by the rules of a certain folk community, they are free to leave, but they must respect the laws of the community while residing there. </p>
<p>Again, it would all be democratic but at the same time still maintain the natural organic hierarchy that is essential to the human condition and it would also be totally against any sort of political parties and parleamentarism which seek only to divide and sunder the community into factions.</p>
