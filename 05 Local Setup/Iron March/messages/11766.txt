<p>maybe i should start doing that. I live in a crappy desert though, I guess I can be a desert hermit. Its good enough for jesus</p>

<p>Ive collected almost all the spiritual books I need, I think when I have every book I need to study Im going to just live in a shack in the woods until the race war</p>
