<p>I was wondering if you had any recommendations for reading material specifically on the subject of the SS as I find it particularly fascinating as an organization. I'd be most interested in documents discussing spiritual teachings, codes of conduct, ethics, propaganda, etc. as opposed to just military tactics and procedures. I particularly enjoyed your post on Himmler's speech about homosexuality.</p>

<p>Any pdfs you can send me or whatever would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Also is Miguel Serrano's stuff worth it? I tried to make it through Nos, Book of the Resurrection and I got bored like two chapters in. Seemed to focus a lot more on seeming occult and mysterious than actually teaching anything worthwhile (although maybe that's a hasty judgement because I haven't actually finished it).</p>
