<p>Pardon me for responding a tad late, I was on holidays.</p>
<p>I use the Ingsoc flag for several reasons:</p>
<p>1. In an ironical way, portraying my anti-marxism, since 1984 was written by a marxist.</p>
<p>2. Because the flag symbolizes unity between state and people, and I, as a non-marxist socialist, believe that the state and the people should always work in close cooperation.</p>
<p>3. And last, it's just a fancy flag, in my opinion <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
