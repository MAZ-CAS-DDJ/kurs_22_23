	hell yeah mange ,
</p>

<p>
	Some days if I'm busy I don't get to it but I try for every day or if my muscles are just worn out and tired I rest them a day.
</p>

<p>
	100 push ups , 100 Bench Presses , 30 to 50 bicep curls , 50 bench dips , 20 deltoid swings variation of bicep curl for shoulders, 
</p>

<p>
	I'm going to start integrating pull ups and maybe crunches to work the abs even more.
</p>

<p>
	I also walk around for a good hour or more to relax and keep my legs and heart healthy.
