	I will very soon undergo an extensive background screen for a job. It is probably a good idea to appear neutral (I have no doubt they will eventually find what I've written here). If its possible, I was wondering if you could please delete my account and all the posts/threads I have made?
</p>

<p>
	I also want to thank you again for allowing me the opportunity to stay and learn more about Fascism even though I was causing trouble.

<p>
	Very respectfully,
</p>

<p>
