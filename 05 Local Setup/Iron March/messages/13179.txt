	And happy Easter to you! I've been good, working hard, job hunting.<br /><br />
	I love the mummies of the Incan Empire, the Mayans too, i certainly have no complaints that their religion of human sacrifice was wiped out but it;s interesting nontheless. What about you?

	Yes, actually, nearby there was a man during the early days who was scorned by his family and went to live in the woods. When he came back to try and work things out with the brother, that brother humiliated him terribly, killed his beloved dog, and the man went mad and killed him, dragging his body off into the woods. The man fled back into the woods and was largely forgotten. After a some months, seven men diappeared one after the other. One night the man was seen creeping through the town and they followed him into the woods, found his encampment, and returned to town. They knew something was wrong os a band of men all went. They found him in the woods, he'd gutted the men including his brother and had skinned and quartered them like animals. Of course the local men killed him, but as he lay dying he laughed and told them they'd now never find his fortune, he had 5,000 dollars hidden away in a strongbox. It was confirmed by others that the box did exist and was hidden, it's still out there to this day.<br />
