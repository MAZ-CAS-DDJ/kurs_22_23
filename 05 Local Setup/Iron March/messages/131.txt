<p>Sorry to hear about the loss of power I hope all is alright, where do you live at? Here in Indy we get some pretty storms as well, last February we had an ice storm that put half the state on a standstill for two-weeks, my town alone got 7 inches of ice. Twas' brutal. </p>
<p>The thing about writing is it takes practice. I've probably gotten a bit rusty myself for not doing it for a couple of months BUT start writing and the rust will start to break off. I want to encourage you to write because right now the most activism we can all do together is churn out the propaganda. </p>
<p>Also, I can edit your work and ghost-write it a bit and still give you all the credit! </p>
<p>Pick any old topic that has to do with American Fascism/Nationalism whatevs, the next issue is going to be intensely American and that being said I don't really want any articles on Mussolini or Mosely. This issue is going to be different since I'm trying to get more writers on board. Don't box yourself in, you can do something on current events, the policies of a super Nationalist President (Teddy Roosevelt for example,) film or music reviews, poetry, etc. You can also do graphics. Check out the other issues of Reaktion! </p>
<p>I'm trying to get Mierce to post the finished version of Issue 1, it has a decent writers guide that may help. </p>
