<p>The topic was about getting to know me, and because I am new, I thought it fitted in quite well, especially as my last 'introduction' got split into a Traditionalist and a WWII thread. I haven't explored the full depths of this group as I have been a member for just two and a half days, surely such junior members cannot face the same penalty as an established and somewhat esteemed member.</p>
<p>I am not arguing with you Dux, but would you point out exactly what I have said that breaks community guidelines? Just for future reference of course, so I do not make the same 'mistakes' again. As far as I can see I have not used any vulgar language, and only insulted Vladimir after he crudely insulted me, even then I kept explicit and offensive language to a minimum.</p>

<p>First, your thread did not belong in Introductions. You still have an separate introduction topic there, so there was no need to have another one. Second, it doesn't matter at all how long you've been a member here. You broke the rules. You got punished. There is no scale here; all get the same treatment. Your offenses were your continued insults directed at Vladimir. It does not matter that "he hit you first" because you still broke the rules. You'll note that Vladimir was also punished. Follow the rules and be civil, that is all we ask.</p>
