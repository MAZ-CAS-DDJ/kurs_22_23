<p>"pretty much every rocket attack on northern Israeli towns by Hezbollah." Dude i find video article but is in Bulgarian i continue to search for the video of some guy who contact the "US judeo cristian solidarity" organizations who spread the news that hundreds of people are wounded or died every day in rocket attacks and after that the news "half mouth" confession of IDF chief of staff who  admited that there were no large scale every day rocket atacks.... So you will see its not "someone" imagination or something <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
