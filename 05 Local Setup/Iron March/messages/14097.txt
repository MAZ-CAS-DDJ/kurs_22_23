	We already concluded that there is Just Fascism... Hitler, Mussolini, Codreanu, Mosley, etc, each of them give us their scope of Truth, each of them had they glasses who see what constitute Natural Order, in the scope of those leaders there are parts of truth and parts of falsehood. So, most Fascism leaders where manifestation of Truth, and they have it the right glasses, but no one of them have said the Last Word on the Worldview, we jusy have to take what is True and Just on all of those views and eliminate what is false.

	 Being pro-Hitler and pro-Strasser can be seeing contradictory but is not, what diferentiate Hitler from Strassers bros is mostly a tactical aproach (Hitler were more moderate inside revolution and Strassers bros just want a Fast total change) and, of course, personal problems and dislikes that they had in the course of their political relation, but fundamentally they are not too much different, they are in the same Worldview, they boot come to almost identical conclusions, Hitler from Volkisch-Darwinistic Scientific Racism, and Strasser from Spenglerian Historiosophy. Also, my admiration of Hitler is because i see he is too fucking great, one of the greastests man of Humanity, i'm not too much on that Mein Kampf stuff, but most of Hitler ideas exposed on that book are damn RIGHT.

	 In conclusion, Fascism is a Worldview that integrate ANYTHING even the most (apparentely) contradictory ideas have a place inside our Worldview but only if they are true, inside Fascism you can give life to you're Leftwing inquetude, hell, even if you like some anarchy and chaos, here is the Place, even if you have some Wild instincts, here you can canalize that for something Higher. Also, dont get botter too much on contradiction, because contradiction is how the mind works and how she reach for the most fundamental conclusions (is what the greeks called, dialetics) i like contradiction and contradictory shits.
