	Usually there's not such a warm welcome, most people get hazed, but a lot of the people who join are random people from /pol/ or something and don't really fit in here. It seems recently like a lot of new users try to haze everyone but end up just looking autistic because they shun off everyone who shows up regardless. It also seems like they begin to think of the site as a fascist "safe space" instead of one of the uses of the site that is literally mentioned in the charter &amp; mission statement, which is that it is here for others to learn, and, to organize with others like you're doing.

	For the most part, just don't make two or more posts in a row in the same thread, instead use the edit button. Don't be autistic and try not to shitpost too much, and you'll be fine. You'll learn your way around
