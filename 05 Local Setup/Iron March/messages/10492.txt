<p>I did know about Iran being Sunni mostly at the time. I actually have a lot of love for Ismail I though, not because of his Shia persuasion, just his leanings towards the batin.</p>
<p>Either one of us could be right about whether or not Veli was an actual "Shia", but I honestly think he wouldnt have claimed to be of either sect because his direct works are focused on much larger issues, but today, the vast majority of people in the order are undoubtedly Shia, although we have no stipulation whatsoever on Sunnis being in the order, I even know Christians and Ismailis in the order.Â </p>
<p>Mawlana was most certainly Sunni. But he, much like you, revered the Ahlul Bayt, he references Imam Hussain and his martyrdom in a couples of poems actually. I think that we tend to read people like Mawlana and Veli with the poltical valance of todays Islam, whereas back then, a Sunni could have a lot of love for Ali, Fatima, Hassan, and Hussain (as) and not be considered a Shia, but today youre hard pressed to find their names mentioned in a Sunni masjid, or the names of Abu Bakr (ra) and Umar (ra) in a Shia masjid.</p>
<p>On the Naqshbandi thing, there are three chains in that order, and only one says it attaches itself to Abu Bakr, and that chain happens to be the one centered in Turkey in the Ottoman period. But who knows. Allahu alim.</p>
<p>As for the sahaba, my opinion is that of the Imams of Ahlul Bayt and the living marja today that dedicate their lives to our fiqh. Some became Muslim due to social isolation and desperation rather than faith, and became hypocrites and undoubtedly did things against the prophet's wishes. BUT, the vast majority were in fact good loyal mumin whose opinions can be trusted.</p>
<p>Can I ask which madhab you are?</p>
