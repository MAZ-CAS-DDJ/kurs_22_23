	I feel that now I am self-disciplined and will be able to improve my life without falling into degeneracy again. I isolated myself for a month from close friends and the wider Fascist community so that I can reflect on more important things, but I still used the forum to educate both myself and give my opinions on certain things. I reached dietary and fitness goals that will be put me back on track. Because of my improvement in self-discipline. I was able to finish most of my personal projects and goals and have embarked on a large project, that I can't speak of, but it will take years (2 to 3) until completion and will contribute to the Fascist Revolutionary struggle in the future.

	I feel ready to communicate again with the members of the EH discord, could I be invited back?
