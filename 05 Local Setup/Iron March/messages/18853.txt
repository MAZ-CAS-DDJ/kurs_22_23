	Cześć. Just a few questions for your perspective of Catholicism. How do most Poles cope with the subversion of the new Church? Me and my close friends have been struggling with accepting its modern concepts and compromise. I do not seek to break Communion with the Church, but it is difficult coping with the Clergy's liberal agenda. Most of my family in Poland practices Catholicism, but remains skeptical of its modern narrative. What is your stance on the decline of our once Traditional beloved Church?
