<p>I can share these thoughts:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First, South Koreans (the majority of them having a great sense of ethnic nationalism) feel a sense of inferiority compared not only to the West but also to the Chinese and Japanese. Much of their modern nationalist sentiment is an attempt to reconcile these feelings and justify their historical perspectives. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For instance, the entire Samhan period (early Korean history, like 1st century AD to 6th or 7th century AD) and much of the history previous to it is, at best, a very fabricated point full of conjecture meant to make them seem like more than a collection of barbarous peoples. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this regard: Korea is in a struggle for deeper national identity as it corresponds to the Japanese and the Chinese more than it is with the West as a whole. There is far more animosity and resentment towards the Japanese than any other group as they are viewed as the lucky ones who industrialized first and then oppressed the Koreans. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I think what is most relevant to the Koreans is the Japanese. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nationalists resent Western cooperation with the Japanese and view it as shortsighted and hypocritical to the human rights that were espoused by the West, e.g. 'we believe all men are created equal but we are going to sign in the Treaty of Versailles that the Japanese get Korea,' etc. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nationalists resent that they were overlooked by the West but appreciate being liberated from Communism. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oddly, a lot of Western decadence as it pertains to movies and pop culture does not enter here as they have now cultivated a very strong domestic entertainment industry that is far more conservative. They simply ignore Western decadence. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Second, the resentment towards the West from the Left is predictable: the West is a colonialist and racist force. They follow some pretty Marxist lite ideas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is pretty typical stuff....</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope this helps a little. </p>
