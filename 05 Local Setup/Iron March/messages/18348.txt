	Kinda hard to say what's technically "new" after months, but overall everything is going well on all fronts. 
</p>

<p>
	AW have gotten into making pretty good videos for their group, going with a grungy 80s VHS recording style that suits them.
</p>

<p>
	Antipodean Resistance group in Australia has been triggering antifa and normies with their nazi stickers (antifa ripped them down, flushed them down the toilet but then FISHED THEM OUT because they were afraid of clogging the pipes).
</p>

<p>
	Some guys in Canada have been doing stickerings of their own but don't know who's doing that and they hadn't formed a proper group yet, so waiting to see what will surface.
</p>

<p>
	As a result of all that activism we've had a slight increase in new user registrations, a lot of autists came on board through that and are currently crying about how much they get bullied.
</p>

<p>
	We've released an IM edition of This Time the World for Rockwell's Birthday anniversary.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of shit was happening about youtube celebrities who either meme nazi stuff to such an extent that the media tries to call them literal nazis; or they literally have come out to talk about their political views which aren't nazi but anti-sjw, so they get branded as nazis regardless, so all of that produced some interesting content and memes. Like so:

	That's about all that comes to mind immediately.

	BTW saw on twitter at some point that you were contacted by (and met up with?) some journalist, he had also asked the IM twitter to put him in contact with Ben from National Action, how'd that go? And what have you lot been up to in general besides the last march you held/participated in?
