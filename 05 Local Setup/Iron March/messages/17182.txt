	I did not know them, except for Darkspace. I will download them in Soulseek and give them a listen soon.

	I know it pretty well, as I was kinda raised in it in my grandparent's (father side) house. I lived there for some years when I was little, then as a young kid and teenager. It's very weird, and Allan Kardec was shunned from the academia in his days. I agree with him. I have read almost all of his works, and other Kardecist/Spiritualist works. They appeal to a kind of Gnostic side that can be approximated to Scientology.

	Yeah, we have many weird manifestations of religion, as a result of centuries of mixing European, Asian, African and Native American spirituality and culture. I have heard and read about Santa Muerte, but I do not know or have contacted anyone who follows her as a main deity.

	I'm not too proud about the Integralists, more now than ever as the 'new' movement is very ridiculous, but it was the main form of Fascism we had here, but it was not tailored after the many folks and cultures we have here in Brazil - instead, it celebrated an inexistent "Brazilian" culture. But they did have many great people there, specially Gustavo Barroso, who wrote extensively about the Jew question. We also had, mainly here down South, NSDAP charters. A city near my hometown, where I lived for almost two years because of University, has many building with Nazi bricks (as the locals call them) and most of the houses had stashes of Nazi memorabilia and treasure. Also we had many officers and soldiers that escaped here.

	Still, the Integralist were the only chance we had, but unfortunately they lost power too quickly. The Estado Novo proposed by our leader Getulio Vargas was also a 'fascist dictatorship' (autocratic paternalist), but he had to ban Nazism and Fascism here, as the USA faked an attack that swung South America into the Allies instead of the Axis (most countries were going that way). Also, there is a local belief that Hitler himself fled here and lived a peaceful life - something that I don't believe, as Argentina and Chile were the most prominent choices he had.<img src="https://tokdehistoria.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/243975-970x600-1.jpeg" alt="243975-970x600-1.jpeg" /></p>
