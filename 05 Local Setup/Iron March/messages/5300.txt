<p>I have been pouring over your fascinating post on AH's personality.  The post is akin to a decade's worth of birthday presents: alluring yet substantive simultaneously; brimming with insight; chocked with tidbits. So full of points and personal opinions, I have not yet thought my comments through fully but, I felt, you deserve at least an initial reply which may engender message exchanges.</p>

<p>Churchill was a kike!  The priceless pile of shit is so revered in Britain as to make me projectile vomit. He did however, as with Hitler, master the art of communication and later in his life, polish his personality for British consumption: had he learned something from Hitler during the mid '30's? In my opinion, certainly. Churchill, I feel, worked furiously, as part of his personal agenda, to dis-credit Chamberlin's attempts at negotiating with Hitler and, as we know, directly or otherwise, that Churchillian objective was met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I wrote my introduction, I described the approach to the Jews as Hitler's Achilles Heel to broad-brush stroke what was, in my view, a way to describe what modern history has placed at the pinnacle of AH's failings as a neat pigeon-hole to vilify the man and the Nazi movement. I feel that a solution to the Jewish problem was necessary and, in my opinion, the western Allies prove that with the creation of Israel. The invasion of the Soviet Union was the greatest military error Hitler made, followed by his inability to invade the British Isles (bar The Channel Islands); his inability to compromise in<em> real-politik</em> with regards to certain races/nations for the short-term is another; his false respect of Churchill I also agree with (and personally wonder what role Edward VIII/Duke of Windsor might have played in creating this illusion as Churchill greatly admired Edward).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyway, I shall digest your smorgasbord of a post and revert once I feel sated and able to unless, of course, you wish to take up a reply beforehand.  </p>
