<p>Pretty well. Instead of leaving, I decided I was going to show that I wasn't going to stand for shit and I was going to be feared if respected at low level. Good decision on my part, I singled each one of them out for a private discussion, found whatever dirt I could on them, found out how to manipulate the shit out of them, and then blackmailed. If they got aggressive I merely beat their shit. They might have the advantage of weight but I had the advantage of height and training. For the most part I won't be dealing with any of them but nobody's giving me anymore shit. I'm not wearing uniforms, I'm not going to PT, I am not doing anything I am not contractually obligated to do.Â <br /><br />The tradeoff is that nobody fucks with me and with a snap of my fingers I can make trouble for anyone else.</p>
