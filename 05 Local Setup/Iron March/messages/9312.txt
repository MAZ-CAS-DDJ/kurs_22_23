<p>Yeats is lovely, I was introduced to him in my literature class two years ago with "Lake Isle of Innisfree." I am a Pound aficionado naturally, T.S. Eliot and Carl Sandburg (for that proletarian aesthetic) are my other favorites. My mother loves Neruda but I have never gotten around to reading his work.</p>
<p>How did you get interested in poetry? Do you write any?</p>

<p>I also read almost everything on PDF. This is my personal archive:</p>

<p>(I should probably add some of these things to the AGwiki)</p>

<p>I read For My Legionaires recently (and made a cover for it); it was what finally made me a true antisemite. Before I was just opposed to Jewish political aims, now I'm much more hardcore than that. What a brilliant man, Codreanu.</p>

<p>My mother is also staunchly antifascist. I mention anything about it and she's like "but teh jooz!" She made me take down my celtic cross flag when she found out what it was.</p>
