<p>I posted them to give Slavros some inspiration for his symbols.</p>
<p>Some of them are good inventions from political games. (atleast its a good source for flags^^)</p>

<p>The first one is from a game called victoria 2.</p>
<p>The idea behind this was first a flag for nazi-germany.</p>
<p>But the swastika was forbidden, so they used a german eagle from the third reich with the flag of the former german empire.</p>
<p>This should be the russian version (for a fascist russia in the game). Its a little bit different, since red and white are exchanged.</p>
<p>The star on this flag is an old slavic symbol.</p>
<p>Called: <strong>Сварогов Квадрат/Звезда Руси - </strong>Svarog Square/Star of Rus.</p>
<p>It has several meanings:</p>
<p>In slavic paganism:</p>
<p>The square should symbolize a furnace of Svarogs (Svarog/Сварог is a god from the slavic/nordic mythology) forge, from the furnace break out tongues of fire.</p>
<p>It means: Freedom, independence, resilience and steadfastness of Rus and Native Faith.</p>
<p>In orthodox:</p>
<p>Its called the <strong>Вифлеемская/Star of Bethlehem</strong> (The advent of christ).</p>
<p>Its symbolize a lady which is the patron of russia. (Sometimes its used to symbolize russia)</p>
<p>You will find more information in Slavros's book.</p>
<p>Background information:</p>
<p>Rus = Русь was the old name of Russia = Россия.</p>
<p>The joke is, a lot of ukrainians tell that they are a different country and that russia occupied them.</p>
<p>The capital of Rus was Kiev, now the capital Ukraine.</p>
<p>Its a long story to keep it short, the mongols destroyed the powerful capital and Moscow became more powerful.</p>
<p>Россия = Russia is the greek word for Русь = Rus.</p>

<p>I think this isnt a real flag, just a fanmade copy. But I like it.</p>
<p>The eagle symbolize the inheritance of the roman empire.</p>
<p>The blazon in the middle is the blazon of moscow.</p>
<p>There is an interesting story about the blazon.</p>
<p>Allegedly it symbolize a slavic rider, who kills a chinese dragon. (Should mean, there was a big war between the slavic and chinese people and the slavic won and the blazon was made rigth after the war. In other words: This blazon symbolize allegedly the victory about the chinese in an ancient war. But thats only a rumor)</p>

<p>I know nothing about this one. Only that the cross in the middle is called the maltese cross.</p>
<p>Maybe a bad choise for an russian flag.</p>

<p>One of many russian fascists flags, which are used today. I dont know what the form exactly means, but I think its related which religion.</p>
<p>The cross in the middle is a celtic cross.They use it because its present in Novgorod and Jerusalem. In other words it symbolize Christianity.</p>
<p>The colors yellow-black-white are the colors of the russian empire. Specifically the colors of the Romanov dynasty.</p>
<p>They symbolize something with "The legitimation of the Tsar abow the country" (Specifically yellow. Thats the most important color!)</p>
<p><img src="http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/ru-ncic.gif" alt="ru-ncic.gif" /></p>
<p>This is again a flag of the game victoria 2. Again an invention of an russian fascist state flag.</p>
<p>Black and white are slavic colors. Red isnt there (except the blazon, that does not count) because it should be different from the soviet flag.</p>
<p>(No red should be used)</p>
<p>Prussian flag:</p>
<p><img src="http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090915093505/althistory/images/f/f5/Prussian_flag.png" alt="Prussian_flag.png" /></p>
<p>This is a prussian flag. I showed it, because I like the black/white contrast. Looks very pure and beautiful.</p>
<p>But I like this style more: <a href="http://www.flaggen-versand24.de/media/images/kaiserliche-marine_big.jpg" rel="external nofollow"><strong>Flagge der kaiserlichen Marine</strong></a></p>
<p>I hope I could help you.</p>
