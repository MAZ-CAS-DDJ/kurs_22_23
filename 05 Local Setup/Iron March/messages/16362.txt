	The reason I messaged you was for a proposition. I'm in the midst of creating my own Nationalist group and Paramilitary with Polish-American Diaspora and Polish Military. The thing is, everyone is going to be required to have served in a nations military, whether US, UK, or Poland. This group is strictly for those with Polish blood. I have a few veterans in my group. My friend who was a 19K on an M1 Abrams just got out of the Army today. We're on the East Coast and Poland, but we're looking to branch out. Was wondering if you would be interested in something like this.
