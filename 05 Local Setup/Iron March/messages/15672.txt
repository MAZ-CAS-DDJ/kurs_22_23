	Hoho, University is a good place for a Fascist, I am sure you will have a lot of good memories from there once you finish it. It is also possible to meet some great people there, since you know, there is always more then one Fascist in a University. I am not a madman, I can completely understand that you can't finish your IronMarch homework if you are going to University on the next week. The new appointment to our interrogation will be the 1st of October. It is possible that I will ask you to watch other movies as well, since that's an easy thing to do.

	Thanks for the information, I have found the video. It's amazing. :)

	I have google-translated some articles from Renacer Europeo, it seems the writers are a little paranoid about the Russians. Though I don't call myself a Eurasianist, I like a lot of things they say. I looked up Hogar Social Madrid and Alternatív Európa as well, but for me it looks like that while the Spanish group is active with a lot of supporters, Alternatív Európa is just a facebook-thing with more Spanish supporters than Hungarians. :D If you want to find a greater Hungarian ally, I would recommend HVIM (though they are somewhat hostile to Serbs, Slovaks and Romanians, but I hope I will be able to change that). If Hogar Social Madrid is interested, I can give you contacts from HVIM, but I think the best group you could learn from is CasaPound Italia.

	Good luck with your own group, I will do my best to help your cause (but I have to learn a lot about the Spanish situation for that).

	And lastly, if you have something more to add, don't create a new message, but edit the old one. Cheers!
