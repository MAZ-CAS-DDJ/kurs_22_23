	Heil bro,
</p>

<p>
	I'm in charge of reaching out to potential recruits here on IM. We saw your intro post and noticed you were in Florida. We have a large chapter of guys down there and wanted to see if you were interested in meeting up and participating in real world activism. 
</p>

<p>
	Check out our stickercausts and trolling of a vigil for the Orlando shooting. All articles about our activities can be found online, notably on DailyStormer. You can also find mainstream source articles as well. 
</p>

<p>
	Hope to hear back from you soon. Keep up the good fight.
