	I'm so happy in the University. There are people with different ideologies but there also fascist or patriot boys, or at least boys that could be fascists in the future. Maybe I talk with them to convince them to join our movement.

	I'm glad that you like Hogar Social. In my opinion the worst thing f the group is the leader (is a girl, what I can't understand, but that is not the worst thing, the worst is that she looks south american, she doesn't look like spanish). There are strong boys that can lead us much better than her, and also give better impression of us.

	The movie was so good, but I had to watch it twice to understand it totally.
