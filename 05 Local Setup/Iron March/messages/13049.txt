	I don't knowmuch of anything about atomwaffen, because there aren't any where I live, or, where most people live. I don't know, there is no English language website to explain what they are.

But if you mean white nationalists, no, were nothing like white nationalists, because you can't be an american fascist and a white nationalist at the same time. You either identify with america, or white folk, Â but the two are not the same. APB is racially inclusive, but exclusive where it concerns immigration.
