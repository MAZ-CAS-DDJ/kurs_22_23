<p>Hmmmm.....maybe my tendencies are not quite so NS.  I'd have economics and race jostling for first position in priorities. I actually feel that the future economics cannot be solved race until the position on is clarified and implemented alongside.  As an example, for labor and wage, until immigration, illegal and much of the legal is stopped, wages cannot truly rise (even if legislated it would be incremental) and unemployment brought down. My view would be deportation for all in the given country illegally and a distinct message to those legally here what the future holds and, if you do not agree, we'll help with your repatriation. That is but touching on the subject.</p>

<p>Seeing what you have done in ABL...thank you.  I have thrown in a few comments and opinions.  I am thinking though the battle over in the UK has got everyone's attention right now.</p>
