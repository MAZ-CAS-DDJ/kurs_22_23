<p>So you don't have to spend all your time reading the thing below, I just want to ask that if you see this account bring accessed from anything other than my usual IP (which should be 75.163.170.224), delete this account immediately. I'm pretty sure the police are watching. I'll explain below if you want to read it all</p>
<p>I don't know if you saw, I think that whole fsb thing was going on when this happened, but if you didn't then I'll fill you in. To put it short, a friend and I, lets call him frank, were dicking about on the school website. We got into an old account on there that was registered as an administrator and we didn't know. He posted hitler stuff everywhere and said kill niggers and whatever. I got into a shit ton of trouble because I logged into it and it was my school, from my school issue laptop. Anyway I ended up being expelled and they confiscated my laptop and searched it. Found just about every IM poster and redpilling image you could imagine. I got a restraining order from district property for 359 days. In the little hearing I went to, one of my other friends who is known to associate with me was brought up and so he was also searched. On his school laptop they found a video of us wearing masks and burning ADL stuff. The administration said we looked like ISIS, so they turned it into the police and said it was being reviewed by homeland security officials.</p>
<p>So he got kicked out too.</p>
<p>He just signed on to steam for the first time since his laptop was confiscated, and it says its been accessed by unkown computers in Colorado springs, Denver, and Pennsylvania, 12 times. Steam license agreement says that a government official can log into a steam account without user permission if necessary and he never was asked for permission, so there's that. So he's definitely being checked in on.</p>
<p>Another thing is I pulled out an old laptop I had hidden and remembered stories of people being watched through webcams. I opened my webcam to see if anything happened and it said another application was using it.. And it hadn't been turned on for at least three months. I opened up manycam to see if it would work and it said another user on the computer had the webcam open but I was the only user on the computer. Totally not suspicious huh?</p>
<p>Anyway I'm concerned they're checking everything we've got so I think some extra steps would be helpful.</p>
