<p>Agreed on the women, I've always said not to waste time on the 6/10s who are always hit on by men because they think they'll have a better chance with her; these girls are used to getting hit on and their self-worth and ego is inflated, they think they're hotter than they actually are. Whereas a genuinely hotter girl (you know the type men will look back over their shoulder at but never approach) is more receptacle to being approached and nicer to have a conversation with because she's actually NOT used to being hit on. Looks and money aren't worth shit when it comes to winning the heart of a woman. Agree with you on the pathetic-ness of LTRs as well, although I;ve had many I've always made it clear that the door is always open for either myself or her to fuck off - I've never put myself into a situation of one-itis, I've always had a back up or continued to be "friendly" with other women and there've been times I've seen whores before coming home from work just because I fancied a change.</p>
<p>There's a taboo argument that adultery in the bible originally meant to "dilute" or mongrelize i.e. mixing. This isn't too out of the ordinary considering the entire context of the bible. If you read an every day dictionary this is the actual definition of the word "adulterate" and it had nothing to do with "cheating" or a sanction against polygamy. "Cheating" is a modern concept and the devious culture around it is what's "degenerate" more than anything.</p>
<p>It is what it is with my girlfriends, I respect them for as long as I do and I'll respect them so long as they're worthy of it but I'm not goo-goo ga ga over them and I don't put up with their shit.</p>
<p>There was a good book put out by a Reverend Lawrence Shannon called The predatory Female; an extremely Politically Incorrect book on the nature of women, it's certainly entertaining. I think you can get it for free online.</p>
<p>I still back the hooligan scene. It's not as popular in Venezuela as it is Brazil, where I'm planning to visit next.</p>
