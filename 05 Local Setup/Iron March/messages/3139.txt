<p>Hello Benjamin.</p>
<p>I don't use Skype. I use Paltalk, I run my own chatroom over there for a few White Nationalists.</p>
<p>It's called "Nationalist Alliance". I would love to see some IronMarch comrades over there, Alex has already been in once or twice.</p>
<p>Regarding this forum I fully intend on sticking around, I mean it would of been pretty weird for me to make an introduction if I was never going to post.</p>
<p>I'll be around, I just like to lurk <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
