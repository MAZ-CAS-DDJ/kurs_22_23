			And this can be seen in all forms of art, and you can also notice that the more "medieval" (in attitude) something gets, the closer it becomes to this ideal of divine beauty (and I don't just mean in medieval Europe, but for instance you can the same principle in great Hindu temples too).

<p>
	The medieval attitude is also just another gate with another path behind it, not an end goal. The reason why I am talking about it is because we can still understand that from the perspective of our age; it is characterized by Christianity and religiosity in general which we still have a connection to. If I would live in the Middle Ages, I would propagate the Antique ideals, if I would live in Antiquity I would propagate the Mythical ideas and so on, always in opposition with the Involution, always in the search for the ultimate source above religions and always propagating its closest representative in time - simply because most people can see only one step ahead.
</p>

<p>
	Present is always fighting on two fronts; it is winning against Past and losing against Future. It is almost impossible for the Past to win a battle, but it is possible to manifest the essence of its values in the Future. We have to be wise when dealing with these revolutions against the Present though, whether they are cultural, political, social or other; because the tendencies which we would like to use against Involution can be turned against us instead - think of the Renaissance which meant to be the spiritual revival of Antiquity but became the precursor of Modernity.

			This also reminds me of the image of a medieval village that would build their church as the House of God, so they'd put their heart and soul into it so much that their hard work would be above all logic and reason, and thus everyone who goes into it would be able to see that this church is a "gap in reality" and they'd be certain that this is indeed a House of God.

	I have heard about statues found by archaeologists with some of their parts built inside the walls of the church - and even those parts were sculpted perfectly, despite of the fact that no man could see them, since the sculptors knew that God sees everything.

	About Epicurus, our perception of him is being distorted by our modern mindset. He wasn't the greatest philosopher, but I am sure that he was much more noble than what they are trying to portray him. Studying Christianity made me humble, so I won't say that I know what he thought (I should learn ancient Greek for that), but if we take into account the milieu of his era, we will have different conclusions:
</p>

<p>
	<u>"He taught that pleasure and pain are measures of what is good and evil"</u>
</p>

<p>
	<s>(In other words: seek pleasure like a degenerate and avoid pain like a coward, and never inflict pain on others.)</s>
</p>

<p>
	Seek Ataraxia (which comes from good deeds), avoid pain like remorse (which comes from bad deeds).
</p>

<p>
	<u>"death is the end of both body and soul and should therefore not be feared"</u>
</p>

<p>
	<s>(In other words: enjoying this life is more important than making sacrifices for the future.)</s>
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGS4SVMWKW8" rel="external nofollow">Death will free our Spirit from the shackles of our souls and bodies.</a> (There is a confusion about this trinity, and thanks to the Involution of the language it has degraded into a duality of soul and body. Remember though that Fascists were always embracing Death, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Guard_death_squads" rel="external nofollow">Codreanu and the Iron Guard</a> are the best examples of that.)
</p>

<p>
	<u>"the gods neither reward nor punish humans"</u>
</p>

<p>
	<s>(I mean, that's no different from John Lennon's bullshit. "No heaven above us, no hell below us, blah blah.")</s>
</p>

<p>
	You don't deserve anything, you have no right for anything, thus you have to fight for what you want to have. (The Christians are often saying that it is not God who tosses us into Hell, but ourselves. He gives us the freedom, and we are committing sins even if we know that we shouldn't, thus we will know that we are guilty even before His Judgement.)
</p>

<p>
	<u>"the universe is infinite and eternal"</u>
</p>

<p>
	<s>(In other words: "dude, we're totally just like tiny specks on a pale blue dot flying in space, yo.")</s>
</p>

<p>
	The universe is infinite and eternal and we are in the center of it. (See Traditional Cosmology.)
</p>

<p>
	<u>"and events in the world are ultimately based on the motions and interactions of atoms moving in empty space."</u>
</p>

<p>
	<s>(In other words: nothing matters, we're all just space dust.)</s>
</p>

<p>
	Every happening comes from actions inside a nexus. (There is a similar Buddhist teaching about God.)
</p>

<p>
	Involution on one hand makes the bad intentions unnecessary, on the other hand it amplifies them. When a theologian says that "God is not a being" vulgar Atheists are thinking that this means "there is no God", but that's false: God is beyond the category of beings since He is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zMf_8hkCdc" rel="external nofollow">existence itself</a>. (It looks like that this is the most shared video by me here; I hope it will help you to make clear one or two things. Bishop Barron is wrong about the Pagan Gods of course.) As you surely noticed, we are constantly dancing on the line between the speakable and the unspeakable here. Metaphysics is the most difficult topic, and you will realize that in the end the only important thing will be the meaning what you can uncover from/give to the worldly things.
</p>

	There is only a few writings in English by our Traditionalists, but I was able to find some of these:

<p>
	I hope this will do it for now. The last one will provide you with additional authors.
</p>

<p>
	Only a few members of Jobbik are interested in Traditionalism, the others are following <a href="http://hercolano2.blogspot.hu/2010/03/julius-evola-two-faces-of-nationalism.html" rel="external nofollow">the degenerate face of Nationalism</a> (what I usually call Chauvinism). I support the party because its leader, Gábor Vona is a good man, and he asked Tibor Imre Baranyi (one of the authors above) <a href="http://magyarforum.hu/upload/314.jpg" rel="external nofollow">to be his advisor</a>. Our monthly Traditionalist magazine also publishes articles written by Vona, so I think we can call him a Traditionalist too. You know, I think the situation is similar to that of Evola and the Fascists: while the Traditionalists are constantly criticizing Jobbik because of its lack of Elitism, the party tries to get more and more voters. (Months ago there was even an attempt from the Chauvinist faction of the party to overthrow Vona, and although he was able to stop them, he couldn't remove them from Jobbik because of their influence.) Even with this, Jobbik is a natural ally of the Traditionalists, just as the Fascists were a natural ally of Evola despite of their disagreements. I wrote about Jobbik <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/946-jobbik/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=165942" rel="">before</a>, but right now I am not so sure what to think about them. Anyway, Vona does the same I would do in his situation, he tries both to stay loyal to his ideas and to become more powerful within the system.

	This can also be seen as a manifestation of strength. Christianity has its own sacred language, it's Latin for the Catholics and Church Slavonic for the Orthodoxes, yet it was still unable to unite these people (not even the Slavs!), because it was never a goal to replace the language of the entire population of these nations. Islam was prepared for this situation too (it's strange that it wasn't able to resist Sectarianism though). What is your stance on the modern phenomenon of language reforms by the way?

	One good friend of mine just sent me a chapter from <em>'The Path of Cinnabar'</em> by Evola. I managed to find <a href="http://www.juliusevola.net/excerpts/Difference_between_Higher_%26_Lower_Views_on_Racism_however_Meaningless_to_Discuss_Today.html" rel="external nofollow">the English version of it</a> and some <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2013/10/aspects-of-racial-doctrine/" rel="external nofollow">addition</a> too. I urge you to read these in order to get the most adequate perspectives for this topic.
</p>

<p>
	These texts will also make it clear that we have to avoid the demonization of our enemies on the higher levels (if we are talking about the masses, we can use demonization as a tactic to boost their morale of course): the Arabs, or the Turks are not your ultimate enemy (that's something I have to remind our Serbian comrades constantly). From the <strong><u>modern</u></strong> standpoint of national states they are occupying much more land than what they <em>'should'</em>, but you have to see that even if an independent Kurdistan would have been established the first thing it should do is to ally with Turkey, with Iran, with Syria etc. because it is the historical mission of the Kurds to be there, to have those neighbors and to fulfill their role with this circumstances in the Cosmic Order. I don't believe in the Pacifist hippie bullshit, but just as there is a time for war there is a time for forming alliances too, and this is needed more than ever (The German Empire has fallen because of the lack of it). What do you think about the concept of a "<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/SadheeSYRIA.jpg" rel="external nofollow">Greater Syria</a>", not as a Syrian "national state", but as a federation of different state subjects?
</p>

<p>
	The Balkans is fucked up because of similar reasons, outer powers always supported relatively smaller communities in order to weaken the stronger ones - thus we have ended up with artificial nations which owe their existence to the tactical decisions of some faraway people. Look at <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Montenegro_territory_expanded_%281830-1944%29.png" rel="external nofollow">how fast</a> Crna Gora (Montenegro) became an independent "nation" thanks to the forces which wanted to destabilize Serbia. Same thing with the Ukrainians who are bitching about losing a <a href="http://russia-insider.com/sites/insider/files/styles/1200xauto/public/a03bcf928ff8811cdc5085bb9edaf835_1.jpg?itok=PHMG-1Mu" rel="external nofollow">territory</a> which was given to them 62 years ago as a present by a Communist fool. Don't misunderstand me, I accept that there is a unique people called Ukrainians, but they are an integral part of the Russian nation. The Middle East and Africa are full with artificial states like these which has to become organic entities if their people don't want to serve Jewish interests in their whole life, but that's something what Chauvinism won't solve. If you are interested, I can show you the downfall of Hungary what was caused by the exact same problems.

<p>
	I meant the latter. It is possible that there will be a "zombie apocalypse" in which the masses will lose their rationality completely and will become animal-like creatures led only by their instincts, though I think that scenario is still more bearable than my vision in which people are just losing their motivation and will literally die because they will be no longer interested in living (Nihilism is the harbinger of this tendency). Those who will be still able to believe in something will unite because by then every form of idealism will lose its meaning. There will be no more society, economy, etc. to maintain. Only one idea will stay, the idea of "there is something beyond".

	Something similar happened here when one of the most notorious Socialists in Hungary came up with the idea to rename his party to "Hungarian <em>National</em> Socialist Party". :D He is one of the most fucked up mongrels in Hungarian politics, a big supporter of the so-called 'Western values', gay rights, globalization and so on, so I am sure about his position on that, but about the Kurdish guy; who knows? There are a couple of transitional ideas between Fascism and Communism (Strasserism, National Bolshevism, etc.) maybe it is possible to somehow 'reform' these Communistic aspirations in the Kurdish society. I remember reading a Traditionalist writing in which the author stated that the name of the NSDAP is quite disagreeable from a Traditionalist viewpoint, and he is right...
