	I think Hitler's story matches many mythological archetypes and epic plotlines used for thousands of years, If we look at it in the context of the anrrative of the epic like George Lucas. We see a boy whose mother told him he was special , non loving abusive father, he leaves home after his parents die to seek out greater adventure , (Luke in episode 4) Â , He becomes disillusioned by it as a homeless man, joins the war etc ....... all these plots and such make him a modern mythological figure
