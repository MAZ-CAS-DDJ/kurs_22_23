<p>Well when I first looked at the site, browsed through all the old threads, it looked to me to just be "classical" fascists - kind of evola-faggy. Of course at the time I was ignorant to such, and I myself was a PC semi-nationalist who basically was just spurred by anti-islam (but not racist) sentiment - since I was still grappling with the old liberal mechanisms that cripple right-wing politics. I'd say that I've been redpilled on race mainly by you, Vlad, /new/ and maybe /pol/ - the atmosphere that's generated as in the confidence and 100% non-wool-wrapped words - that tends to be the case which is vital, the social factor as well as the actual content of sentiment. You could be another PC David Duke, as Ben said in the propaganda thread, and give the info and present it in a delicately put way; but it would not at all compare to the alternative option of being straight to the point, blunt and conflicting/offensive. Those two options also create very different "nationalists", the whiny stormfags who still cow-toe to the liberal agenda (e.g crying about the plight of the white race, boo hoo :-( ), and unrepentant open and sentimentally strong nationalists who don't fall prey to kike tactics. </p>

<p>"Gas the kikes, race war now!" is still a joke, yeah, but compared to 2 years ago it is far closer to the modern Ironmarcher now - another good route for the redpill, comedy and lack of ultra assburger delivery; adding a site-humour that doesn't take itself seriously, but manages to ingrain in your head. Lol, even that Cromwell dude is beginning to dislike fags, and he's got some family who're afflicted - without Ironmarch, he wouldn't even be close. </p>
