<p>If you want my opinion you are generally right but I think it is about being laid back generally, not any political concessions. Taking a leaf out of the Russians; Tesak, wotanjugend, white rex, etc they all these 'hipsters' that were attracted by a popular interpretation of national socialism which is very cool and casual. They make no pretensions that their ideology isn't ruthless and extreme - and are Self aware of this, they are not doing it to be edgy. National socialists stake their claim, and the artists or whatever will fall into orbit - this is different to trying to be hipsters ourselves.</p>

<p>Freedom or whatever you want to call it will come from how accessible the ideology is - it being 'chic' that is what attracts hipsters, and that is all people need, they accommodate themselves, they don't have to fit the mould - the force if the mould presses them into shape.</p>

<p>Having libertarian attitudes will not ultimately affect things one way or the other.</p>
