<p>1st part. Heavy Nihilism. Anti-Modern, opposed to Liberal Humanism, Basically just seeks to tear down everything about the society we live in.</p>
<p>2nd part. More of a focus on Futurism and Actual Idealism. Some Fight-Clubesque rhetoric. Instill the belief in building a better future rather than being sentimental about the past.</p>
<p>3rd part. Fascism without using the term. Nowhere do I touch race or religion, as neither is a notion I care about whatsoever. I may say that while the Right says "Race War Now! Gas the kykes!" the Left often espouses "Class War Now! Shoot the Whites!" and point out how it is a ruinous cycle that is a bar to unity.</p>
<p>The concept is literally 2 weeks old and I've already got an interview from a Professor of Philosophy at Rice and a maybe from a Romanian Professor who travels to Houston on ocassion. WhaT i need are more interviews though, ad stock footage of things like dilapidated buildings, Occupiers, etc.</p>
