	Berberism is a political product of french occupation of Algeria for divided the algerian people, I m an ancient berberist in my young period... but I discover all the pro-zionism tendencies -Berberism is a weird mixing between a leftist friench ideas- identitarian-ethnical ideas-and zionism ideas. Very anti-islam movement.

	Azawad is different. I m pro-Azawad because it's a good thing, like a giant wall, protect us from the niggers waves. Tuareg is a warrior people, sadly mixed, but not dangerous for racial stabilty of algerians (esspecially whites of us) because this people don' t mix with others.

	In Algeria, we have many courageous men in our army, and some good people in the politics, but it's few, we need an organisation of elite, we don't have a fascist elite like you in Hungary r other european country. You have a BIG chance to have a different fascist movement (mozgalom) in your nation.
