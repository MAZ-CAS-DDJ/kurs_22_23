	Hi Alex,
</p>

<p>
	it's sad to write to you with such a subject, but me and other guys got raided last week by police or Lithuanian CIA, can't be sure, because of our last banner drop and our video "Skydas ruins VE day". We are facing court(probably). From 5 people our law enforcement confiscated 12 PC's so it's kind a hard to act now as a whole. If it is possible, please keep this information for yourself, later in future we will definitely going to create an article or just an action report about our troubles. But for the time being I can't create that red-pill video with Mason, which is really sad on my behalf. We are probably going to announce some kind of "prisoners of war" donation campaign, because we will need lawyers. You can be sure, that we are not retreating or anything, just staying silent for the time being. If you have any tips or suggestions, it would be welcome.Â <br /><br />
	P.s. Things are really different in other parts of world than Lithuania.
