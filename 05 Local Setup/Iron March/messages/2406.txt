<p>Personally I think early on it was a "Nationalist" movement like Ho Chi Minh (albeit very anti-Japanese) under Kim Il Sung but I think it has degenerated into a farcical parody of high Stalinism... "Communism" can be used as a means to an end, like with Ho Chi Minh, but I don't think it should be used as its own end for the pursuit of nationalisms...</p>
