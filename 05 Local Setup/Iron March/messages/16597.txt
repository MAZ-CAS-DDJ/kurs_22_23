	Hello there.
</p>

<p>
	I still have to study the subject, but if we want to see clearly, first we have to research the historical sources and secondly, we have to understand the origins of these theories you mentioned. The idea of the Daco-Romanian continuity was born in the XIX. century, the age of Chauvinism, and back then the main goal of the Romanians (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_points_of_the_Hungarian_Revolutionaries_of_1848" rel="external nofollow">Hungarians</a>) was to conquer Transylvania. This fact won't confute the theory by itself, but there are other arguments against it as well. We don't know nothing about the Dacian language for example, and the main support of the continuity is the unknown origin of a few non-latin words present in the Romanian language - those supposed to be Dacian, but the territory of Dacia was under Roman occupation for only 150 years, and that period of time is simply not enough to completely replace the language of an indigenous culture. Also take into account that parts of today's Romania were under Germanic control for roughly 300 years, under Turkic (Avar, Bulgar, Pecheneg, Oghuz, Cuman) control for 800 years (+ the Ottoman era), and under Hungarian control for 1000 years; yet the Hungarian and Turkic influence is minimal and we can't even talk about a Germanic one. The Romanian language has however a linguistic relative - the Albanian; and the other branches of the Romanian language (Aromanian &amp; Megleno-Romanian) are all located in the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/South-Balkan-Romance-languages.png" rel="external nofollow">south of the Balkans</a> - with one exception, and that is the Istro-Romanian. I have already mentioned that I am not a professional, but in my opinion the ancestors of the Romanians were Romanized Illyrians, who were first migrated South, to Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa, and later some of them moved North-East, through Serbia and Bulgaria (that's why the Second Bulgarian Empire was called "Bulgarian–Wallachian Empire") to the territory of present-day Romania (see the Diploma Andreanum, in which Andrew II of Hungary calls the territory of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Tara_Rumaneasca_map.png" rel="external nofollow">Făgăraș</a> 'Terra Blacorum', or see the term '<a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungro-Vlahia" rel="external nofollow">Ungro-Vlahia</a>'). This is of course doesn't mean that the Dacians has nothing to do with Romanians, but they are not as influential as the theory of the Daco-Romanian continuity states.

	These things are although not as important as you may think. Hungarians are genetically 99% Europeans, yet we still keep our ancient Eurasian heritage. I wouldn't care if the Romanians were mostly a Balkan mix with a purely Dacian Volksgeist - but that's not the case, since the whole theory was established only to justify the territorial claims for Transylvania. The real Romanian Volksgeist was formed by the Roman Imperialist idea, by Orthodox Christianity, by the connection with the land and yes, by the nations surrounding Romania. Whatever they do, Romanians will always have more in common with Hungarians and Bulgarians than with the French or the Italians.

	The same applies to you. You have chosen your Romanian heritage even if you have more British blood - but if this has been settled and you are serious, you have to learn the language and return to home.
