<p>You're very wise not to intervene in the shenanigans going on between Torren and his old lady. When shit like that happened to my friends and girlfriends there would be times when I'd be asked to intervene and it just caused a whole lot of shit. It always back fires. Americans are weird, they do that shit to each other and get clingy and can't part from each other until it gets very bad.... if they're lucky. There is nothing in this country that actually holds people together except perhaps a concept of "family" you'll find a lot of Americans who aren't even related will consider each other family. Best thing to do is literally block it out. It will get to you, I promise you that. If it does excuse yourself and go outside and fuck around. Americans are all actually very neurotic and bipolar.<br /><br />Whatever you tell me about Torren will stay between us. I've honestly no idea why despite the contradictions me and him have I am (between us) always worried about him and privately-emotionally invested in him despite the fact we really don't talk often. WHy does he trust me so much?</p>
<p>Also, what all have you done in America besides shoot guns? Have you tried any drugs with Torren? I'd probably get high with him if I had the chance, but only once.<br /> </p>
<p>Also, have you had your baptism of fire? It's a complicated issue for me and is probably rooted in deep psychological shit as well as insecurities I've been having since I came back North from Tennessee some months ago during the StormFront conference. I'd like to explain to you all of it but it'd basically be me internet crying/confiding on your shoulder. If I have your permission to do so, I'd like to talk to you about some personal shit of my own. We've been in this together more or less for 5 years and I need the advice only your English logic and level headness has to offer.<br /><br /><br /> </p>
