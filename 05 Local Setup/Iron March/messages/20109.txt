	I am not moving to Europe but taking an "extended vacation" to see my motherland and to clear my mind. I will be in peace to read and find myself.  6 months is not very long and I will be back soon.

	I've definitely been mind blown and I only just started reading. I know it sounds autistic but it's as if these books were tailored to my longing. I've been holding back my beliefs from the start, but I am worried this is some honeypot. It just doesn't make sense why the police haven't tapped into this yet.
