<p>Well before several years our state was 1/1 to Ukraine "ruled by criminals, the economic situation is as bad as it can be and politics are a soap opera" then we entered EUSSR and at first the things were basicly the same just the prices jump high. Now 5 years after : The prime minister are one of the mafia bosses and kill or arrested all others, interior, finance and exterior ministers are confirmed CIA agents,, The country is functioning on magic the treаsury  is emtpy our money are spend to build "European highways" but still pay tax to use them.. Police dont do any of their jobs (Аrmy is disbandet NATO requirement ) especially when came to gypos. The police dont bother to arrest them but if it happend to be arrestet the judge free them. But in the opposite is savage. Rulling class are afraid that we may take justice in our own hands and so they judge us severe..  Country go to civil war and in 10 years maybe will be split in at least 2 (Kosovo model).. The things are pretty bad.</p>
<p>As for the gypos now there is new breed of them

Now these are different story.<p>We will survive and win but first some terrible thing must happen that the majority of Bulgarians to wake up from its naive dream about "How the EUSSR employees is spending all day and night of thinking our prosperrity" "How the democracy give us freedom and how the ellections are fair" stupid fucks half of them will run away when the war is come, shame to our nation. But we see the light at the end after civil war when our country is destroyed and most of dumbasses are left we will be free to rebuild it again and this time will make no mistakes <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>Our nations don't have a future as long as we are sold and bought by east and west like cheap whores. Arguably, the countries of eastern and southeastern Europe are more in need of a national revolution than anyone else. In Ukraine, the problem is: there is no really competent nationalist movement here. There is an endless mass of bigger and smaller organizations, but no unity and some of them do not even follow a consistent ideology. Building a proper Ukrainian nationalist movement is a difficult task itself. But it has to be done if we ever want to regain our national dignity.</p>
