<p>I'm not in the Klan.  I knew a few members years ago, but they were full of self-destruction and seemed to be going nowhere.  I chose that avatar because it's the only one I got to fit.  I wanted the one with the baby dressed like Hitler with the caption "I believe the children are the future".  I've been leaning toward a third position party here in the States.  </p>
