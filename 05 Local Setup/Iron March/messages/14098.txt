	Two is no problem mate. I know right now we are pretty small and are focusing on recruiting people to take leadership positions and build it from the ground up. In Brisbane Were focusing on getting a small loyal group who can act as the leaders or at least be the first dedicated members. Im hitting up the Brisbane Chapter President right now and hes gonna ask the higher ups about having any lads in Tassie. Also, do you reckon the lad you said you met,Unity, would be interested? If so and your both willing, if there isnt a Tassie chapter we could work on setting one up
