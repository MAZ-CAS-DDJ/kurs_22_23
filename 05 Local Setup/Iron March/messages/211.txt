<p>I'd be interested in contributing something to Reaktion, particularly an article on far-right movements in my own country. If you're okay with the idea perhaps you could link me to some of the old issues, or provide me with a scan or two so I can see what kind of publication it is and what might be expected of an article?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
