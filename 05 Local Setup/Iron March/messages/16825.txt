	I see. You make very good points in those two paragraphs. The "Jedem das seine" part especially opened my eyes to the bigger picture that you've been referring to here. We pretty much agree on everything there now.

<p>
	True, but you probably know that Islam has its own emerging version of sola scriptura as well: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quranism" rel="external nofollow">Quranism</a>. The wikipedia article is not that detailed because Quranism hasn't had a Martin Luther of its own, but the sentiments behind Quranism are actually very popular in the Middle East. I see it endlessly in the Middle East, where Muslims constantly express that exact same sentiment that the Protestants do, though this is not an exact movement yet.
</p>

<p>
	Besides, it's not like Islam isn't also full of elements that could turn into humanistic and individualistic germs. One of the first chapters in the Quran interprets the Cain and Abel story like "anyone who kills a single human being, except if it's for corruption, would do as if he just killed the entire world." Another famous Quran verse goes like "I have my religion, you have your religion," which is nowadays always interpreted as "A multicultural and secular society where every religion in the world mingles together is the best." Mohammad also liked to go on and on about human equality (I kid you not) in his speeches, and in fact his very last speech (and his most famous one) contains something almost explicit about equality, to the effect of, "No person is superior to any other person, no white person is superior to a black person, no Arab is superior to a non-Arab, we're all the same." Now, you can argue that these words have esoteric meanings behind them (like Jesus' "love your enemies" as you mentioned), but Islam definitely contains this germ of equality and democracy too. Hell, I actually remember being told as a kid that "Mohammad invented democracy" in one of the mandatory Islam classes I had to take in elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KAPKYKhTp8U?t=34" rel="external nofollow">Watch this</a> from 0:34 to 1:06, and you'll see what I mean: the guy literally establishes a link between modern democracy and Islamic councils held during that time, as if those things are natural continuations of one another.
</p>

<p>
	Regarding the ruthless slave mentality, you have to remember that Sunni Islam has never had unified churches with hierarchical clergy like Christianity or Shi'ite Islam does, but rather it was always under the wing of the various Muslim empires, who acted as the religion's clergy. Now, the last Sunni Caliph was the Turkish Ottoman sultan, and he was deposed by his own country after WWI. So the Sunni Muslim world hasn't had anything even resembling a leader for over a century. Imagine if Catholics didn't have any popes (not just antipopes or conflicting or sedevacante popes, but just no popes at all) for over a century, or if the Orthodox didn't have a Patriarch of Constantinople (or Moscow) for a century, and all you had was just the rabid masses fighting over the religion against a backdrop of foreign imperialism. That's the main reason behind the current mentality of the Sunnis. But even then, they're not unified in this behavior of a uniform horde of primitive warriors either, but in fact they're split in half: one half consists of the ruthless slaves you mention, while the other half consists of degenerate slaves who masturbate to American porn while bragging about their Givenchy bags and Mercedes cars. You have to go to the Middle East to see for yourself: the masses are far more degenerate than you think (though not as openly degenerate as Europeans, since they still feel a bit more shame about it, but they're definitely getting there too).
</p>

<p>
	Nevertheless, you're absolutely right about ISIS, and I definitely agree with you now about the fact that they're not a true return to Tradition. That point you made about unity (hierarchical order) vs uniformity (a primitive horde) is what really connected the dots for me. That is the difference between a group like ISIS compared to something like the SS. In fact, now that I think about it, this is also just like comparing the SS to the Bolshevik hordes that they were fighting against during their own time. (Except now there is no SS to be found anywhere in the world [maybe us fascist Kurds will end up creating it, lol]). But yeah, I see it clearly now. And it really makes you appreciate that we truly are fighting for Order and Beauty and Truth, whereas all the other enemies (communists, capitalists, salafists, faggots, you name it) are the forces of decay and degeneration.

	Very good points all over there too, especially about the primacy within the hierarchy (which I should have noticed myself now that I think about it). Honestly, you're like a fountain of knowledge. :)

			Now that's the opposite of Humanism because Humanism focuses on our personalities, on those things which separates us from God.  It is also the opposite of equality, because the Christian knows that for him and his people the Sufi path would be impassable - that's why he lets the dividing substance intact, because it is essential for those at the foot of the mountain.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I see now. You put it perfectly here. So then, metaphorically speaking, the reason why this is different from humanism is because we're talking about those who are already striving to reach the top of the mountain; we're not talking about those who are stuck at the bottom. Humanism is what happens when those at the foot of the mountain put their personalities over God, and that's where you get multicultural degeneracy. But for those at the top, they've already put God over themselves, which is how they'd understand why the different paths are there. And that's where we reach what you've always mentioned: the unity of quality at the top, compared to the uniformity of quantity at the bottom. Hmm, I see what you mean now, although I still have some reservations about this whole issue. Namely, my main reservation is this: you should never tell the masses about any of that, because that would really endanger the religion with far greater possibilities of the perversions that you mentioned earlier. Because if you tell the masses that there are different paths to Truth (or if you give them any indication even close to that idea), then they'll inevitably misunderstand it and think that it means that all religions are equal and that secularism and equality are good. But if you tell them that only our religion is right and all others are false, then the masses will continue the religious practice as they normally do; and meanwhile, the spiritual elite will naturally rise up above this small-scale thinking and understand the truth of the issue the more they reached God. Wouldn't this be the correct solution to this issue?
</p>

<p>
	This actually reminds me of Savitri Devi's A Son of God, where she talks about something similar at the beginning of the book. I've only read the beginning, and it was quite a while ago, so I don't exactly remember… but if you know about it, do you think that this is what Akhenaten was trying to do with his Sun cult? Was he actually trying to teach the full Esoteric Truth to the masses? Perhaps that's why he failed…

<p>
	Nah, I'm not. My ancestry is Kurdish all the way down. Otherwise, I would have had a choice to go with either my Kurdish half or the other half, and I would have probably chosen the other half since it would have been a much easier path to take. (No offense to you guys, of course, if you know what I mean.) :D
</p>

<p>
	And regarding the maps, those were certainly made with a linguistic perspective. It's true that the Kurdish language is closer to other Indo-European languages like English and German, compared to something like Hungarian (fun facts: "new" in Kurdish is "nû", "thanks" is "spas" similarly to the Russian "spasibo", and "iron" is "asin" similarly to the German "eisen"). But racially speaking, those maps are definitely false. Most Kurds look Iranic (e.g. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/FXVIf2D.jpg" rel="external nofollow">like this</a> or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3NOqAoC.jpg" rel="external nofollow">this</a>), and only a small minority (about 20% or so) have European features. (By the way, do you happen to have any information on where those few Nordic-looking segments of the Iranian ethnicities came from, despite being native to our regions for thousands of years? I don't buy the Mein Kampf argument that they're leftover descendants of the ancient Aryans. But at the same time, obviously they had to have come from somewhere.)

<p>
	Haha, I just remembered that. This whole Slavros affair really surprised me when I first found out about it. After reading A Squire's Trial and other stuff written by him, where I've seen him fawn over "blond haired and blue eyed" Nazis so many times, I used to think: "Man, this Slavros guy must be a Nordic<a href="http://orig11.deviantart.net/059b/f/2016/118/1/8/young_bismarck_by_arminius1871-da0jor3.png" rel="external nofollow"> prince of the purest blood</a>." But then when I first saw what he looked like after I googled him, I couldn't stop laughing. I was like, "This is the founder of Iron March? Everyone in my family is whiter than that," lol. It was definitely a shock, especially considering how he's apparently half-Russian, and yet his Asiatic features are so predominant that I would have honestly mistook him for an Indian if I didn't know. Strange world.
</p>

<p>
	And by the way, just between you and me, I honestly think Slavros probably has some really deep-seated self-hatred due to his mixed race background. I don't want to get all Freudian, but I can imagine a kid growing up in a Russian school while the Chechen Wars were going on, and meanwhile he'd be bullied because he looked like he came straight out of the Caucusus region. Then he internalized all of this, but instead of becoming a Muslim fanatic, he went the opposite way and became a fascist with a love for Germanic Sonnenrads. Again, it's just really weird how he ended up like this. Makes you wonder about his internal psychological make-up. :P
