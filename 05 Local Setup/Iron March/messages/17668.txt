			On February 11 at 5:50 PM., Karl Pfeffer-Wildenbruch (commander of the defense base in Budapest) made the following announcement on his radio:
		</p>

		<p>
			1. We have exhausted our rations and loaded our final cartridges. We, the defenders of Budapest, may choose between capitulation and massacre. The remaining combat-ready fragments of the German army, the Honvédség (national defense force of Hungary) and the Arrow Cross will together launch an offensive action in order to secure a new base of operations.
		</p>

		<p>
			2. At sunset on two-eleven I'm breaking out. I request rendezvous in the vicinity of Szomor-Máriahalom.
		</p>

		<p>
			3. Signal: twice green equals friendly forces.
		</p>

		<p>
			4. Effective strength: 23,900 Germans of whom 9,600 are wounded; 20,000 Hungarians of whom 2,000 are wounded; and 80,000-100,000 civilians.
