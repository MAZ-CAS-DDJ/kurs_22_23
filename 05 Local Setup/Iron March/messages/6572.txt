<p>   As for Aryan religion and Christianity, basically all higher religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity) descend from a common source that lies in the extreme past, which was the religion of ancient Aryan people. Atlantis, Hyperborea, that whole bit. Christianity shares plenty in common with all these other religions, as well having common ground with neoplatonism, since many of the Church Fathers were involved in that Philosophy.</p>
<p>I assume you may think all this esoteric shit is garbage (you just seem to be that kind of dude from your posts) so I'll just leave it at that. Need sleep anyways.</p>
