Based on the rest of your views, I would rather see you as a firm supporter of State Socialism. Though you could also perceive State Socialism as the apex of economical evolution which first requires a certain mindset inoculated within the citizens before enforced.</div></blockquote>
<p>I see syndicalism as the end of "economic history " so to speak. It cannot be achieved without first establishing a society that is ready for it. If the traditional view is capitalism leads to socialism, which in turn  leads to communism than my view (and that or most fascists of the classical sort) would be capitalism leads to corporatism which leads to syndicalism. I have quite a lot of respect for State Socialism, however I see it as a means to an end, not the actual goal. Economics is something I have just recently really studied but I realizit was an important ideological piece I waw missing.</p>
