<p>Was raised in shit ghetto neighborhoods, learned the values of tribalism and being surrounded by your own people from a young age. I didn't really get into National Socialist thought until 9th grade though when I started learning about Germanic Paganism. I learned about both at kinda the same time so at least for me they're meshed together and compliment one another. </p>

<p>I wasn't really raised with any sort of culture, my mom didn't take my to church and I never learned anything from my parents beyond some practical stuff from my dad. So I guess that made me a blank slate and made me want to seek out the culture of my forefathers and revive it. When I realized that this is exactly what the ebbul Nazis were trying to do in Germany on a bigger scale, I saw who the true good guys were</p>
