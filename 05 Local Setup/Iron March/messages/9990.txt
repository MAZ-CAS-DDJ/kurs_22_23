<p>Yeah colleges are poison especially American ones. If I were you I would never to America and never have a class here. They dont even hide their Marxist bullshit anymore, if you havent seen the pic I showed in the College thread you should go and look. They openly promote Marxism and tell us to read our books "with Marxist critical analysis". What a fucking joke. </p>

<p>Whats really sad is they teach us NOTHING useful, these kids are all going to think they're chanigng the world because they read the Communist Manifesto but in reality they will be useless fucking NEET's with no jobs within 5 years. </p>
<p>I'm probably going to drop college soon and go into trade school. Might even just say fuck it and go innawoods and live off farming for a while. </p>

<p>I want to help Europe badly. I have many friends in Germany and I hate to think of what's going to happen to them. If I could I would move to Germany right now; I want to be there to help my kinsmen when the struggle begins. Hell I'm more fucking German than most of the Germans I've met, I know more about their ancient culture and history than most of them seem to. </p>
<p>We must revive global pride in white cultures </p>
