<p>Well, I know about the book, but never had the chance to read it before.</p>
<p>As for the Han Chinese and the nomads, I think I can understand why the author can appreciate the free-spirit of the nomads, but we do not revere the wolf merely for its ferocity and strength. We believe the wolf to be sacred due to the fact that both us Turks and Mongols believe that the Sky God Tengri, has come to the world in the shape of a wolf, and mated with man, and gave birth to our people. We believe that the wolf is our direct ancestor, and therefore we have claimed it as our totem animal, and the representation of our national soul.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Han Chinese too, had worshipped heaven, as they considered their emperors to be the sons of heaven. Their sedentary and sheepish livestyles also merit some credit. Whereas we have dispersed our kind across a large area, the Han Chinese have managed to maintain a definite presence in a single area, and although they were a lot less expansionistic, they had a lot more time to develop their civilisation, whereas we required "templates" in order to build one.</p>
<p>As you see, both worldviews have their respective advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>Indeed, there are merits to both systems. In truth, much of the expansion of China relative to its current limits was done under the rule of the Qing (Manchu) Dynasty. The Manchu people were also originally nomads, and they had a tradition of equestrianism and archery. They segregated themselves from the Han, yet it seems they fell into decadence, and to the detriment of all peoples in the Middle Kingdom, were unable to effectively lead its defense against the encroachment of Western and Tsarist imperialism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is to the credit of the Ottoman Turks that they adapted and fended against such encroachments as best as they could, while other Turkic peoples were being gradually subjugated by Tsarist forces. I respect Atatürk greatly as I see his accomplishments as nothing short of miraculous. My father told me about the Göktürks, and he considered Turks to be a 'great people' precisely for having been a thorn in the side of China (the romantic tale of Kursat and his 40 warriors comes to mind), as well as the emergence of distinct Turkic states in modern times.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Turks in America are known for being well mannered and educated, indeed they do lobby on behalf of the Turkish Republic from time to time, but it is understandable given the present internationalist stance of America and the existence of very influential Greek and Armenian lobbies. Armenians on the other hand, are despised here for cheating the system, using welfare and food stamps while driving leased luxury cars, and generally being dishonest, unhygienic, and bigoted. This surprised me as Armenians are well received in Europe, perhaps Bolshevism influenced the most recent Armenian immigrants to America.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I find Nihal Atsız to be a very interesting character, and it is a pity that his works have not been translated into english, and at the present, are limited to a few academics here. I am aware of his opinions of the Chinese and other peoples, but I wonder why he mentioned Japan as a potential enemy of Turkey in his letter to his son (perhaps Atsız didn't like Japan's expansionism in Korea?). From what little I do know about Atsız's life, he was consistent and stuck to his views in spite of all the inconveniences it caused him, which merits respect.</p>

<p>The Manchus fared a lot better than the Mongyol and the Shato Turks, Khitans and Jurchens(whom they descended from), as they did what the previous invaders didn't do. They ruled China with utmost tyranny at first, forcing the Chinese to adopt Manchu customs, ways of dress and hairstyle, all the while re-organizing the state to fit their purposes. However as you had said, they fell into decadence, and they were unable to defend China against the imperialistic schemes of others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Ottomans held out as long as they did because they spent a lot of time to actually try and force Turks to settle down. A number of Turkish rebellions broke out just because of this, as the unruly Turkomans would not submit to central authority. They wanted things to be as they were during the time of the Seljuks, where the Sultan would dance according to their tune. The Ottomans were able to destroy the tribal influence on the state by employing non-Turks in their service, with no tribal associations, and the Turks gradually became the "military caste" of the Ottoman empire.</p>
<p>But this was precisely the reason why the Ottoman empire finally shrinked to the size where its only supporters were the Turks in the Anatolian heartland of the Empire, and there, Atatürk used this to his advantage. He knew that a nation needed more than just warriors, so after the foundation of the state, he instated a number of reforms to transform a caste of warriors to perform the tasks of a modern nation state.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By the way, its remarkable, you know a lot about this...About Kurshad and his 40 warriors, about Nihal Atsız. He wrote these as a testament to our pre-Islamic glory, and well, many great Turkish nationalists can list the death of the Gray Wolves and its sequel as inspiration, as do I.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for Armenians, I think that they are if anything, untrustworthy. As for being well-received in Europe, even Kurds are well-received in Europe, but not us. Not that I really care, but the fact that the supposedly "liberal" Europe chooses its friends via Indo-European based bias is beyond me.</p>
<p>I don't think it carries a religious undertone, I think its just the typical liberal approach to any minorities that claim to have been persecuted, as long as they are not Turks, of course <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for Nihal Atsız' opinions on Japan, well, as far as I'm concerned, he put them under the "future enemies", probably due to them being a strong-willed nation of a character that he probably envied, and saw them as our true rivals in that regard. I do not think he harbored any real animosity towards them.</p>
<p>He was constantly persecuted for his outspoken stance. Perhaps you know about the 3rd of May, which we Turkish nationalists celebrate as "Türkçülük günü", or "Turkism day", which was all about a response from the Turkish youth to an unfair accusation and trials that related to him and his friends.</p>
<p>Aside from being uncompromising, he knew the meaning of sacrifice, and he spoke of it as the highest of virtues.</p>
