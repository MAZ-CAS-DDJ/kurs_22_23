	It's a shame, it's like any other serbian organisation besides C18, they all let "nationalists" join them even though most of them would be considered qlt alt-right, and then they claim that they're fighters for the cause. Lol. Â It ain't true fight until you start doing something besides sticking stickers on lampposts.
