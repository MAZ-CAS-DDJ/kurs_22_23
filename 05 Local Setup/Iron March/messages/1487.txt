<p><span style="font-size:14px;">"</span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;"><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I thought Anton LaVey was a genius, but most of the people who rally around him have been dodgy to say the least. "</span></span></span></p>

She's really intelligent, but she just can't follow through those ideas. She knows them backwards and forwards but can't apply them to her own life; she has to resent somebody for the fact that she's an utter failure, so who better to blame than her father? </span></span></span></p>

But being a spokesman for the Church has become something of a distraction for me in recent years. I no longer have the patience to explain it, or argue it, or ever discuss it.</span></span></span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;"><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"</span></span></span></p>
