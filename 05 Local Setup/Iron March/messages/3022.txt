<p>Thank you, it's a subject close to my heart truth be told. Thousands died to prop up the myth that any Pro-European religious leanings were due to Satanic influence and I it is horrible to see that people are still persecuted, though now it is for expressing any Pro-European belief and opposition to Marxism. Thankfully we live in more civilised times, if they were to kill any of us openly, they would find themselves engulfed in a storm that they would be unable to weather.</p>
