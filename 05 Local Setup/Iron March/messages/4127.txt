<p>Hey man, I had an evening to kill and took the time to read over that big "The possibility of American Integralism" thread you contributed a lot to. I definitely liked a lot of what I saw in there. You did mention that you were (at least at the time?) writing a manifesto of sorts. Did you ever end up posting that anywhere? If so I'd be interested to know more.</p>
