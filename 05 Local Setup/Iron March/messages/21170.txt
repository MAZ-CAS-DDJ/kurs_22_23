	I'm not enjoying Lightning in the Sun one bit, it's boring and the translation is terrible. But I'm enjoying Miguel Serrano greatly. What he says is true to the word. The whole Astral world is really drawing me to it, since my family and I have had experiences in the astral world. He's also really piecing everything together about Hyperborea and the Aryan race for me. But do I need to read Hindu Religious books before I can fully understand EH?
