<p>I had written some stuff for the English version of Skinhead Magazine. It was a French zine, been a few years since I spoke to the eic so I'm not sure what the status of the zine is but they were always looking for help. I'll have to dig up the guys email. We also have our own zine here, Noose, I've been waiting to write for....cough cough</p>
<p>Well?</p>
