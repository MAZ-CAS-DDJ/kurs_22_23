<p>Me and you are definitely going to get a long brilliantly. Egypt has a very racialist outlook and spirit, it has done historically since the ancient times and that sentiment is still present from what I know, that goes well in Egypt's favour. Its fine traditions, spirituality and culture and history is without a doubt something to cherish, promote and preserve.</p>
<p>I'd love to see more information and input from your part of the world on this forum because as I can't stress enough, I have a great admiration for Egypt and it would be a shame to see it waste away to materialism, much like the western world slowly is also.</p>
