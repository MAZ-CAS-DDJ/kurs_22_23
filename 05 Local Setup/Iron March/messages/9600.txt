<p>I am indeed pursuing citizenship, it is a tough process. I qualify under my great-grandfather being a citizen of the Kingdom of Italy and never naturalized in the United States. I have to prove his birth to the citizenship authority, this is more difficult than it sounds because records in Napoli are spotty to say the best. If he was, say, Venetian it would be a piece of cake. If they can't find the records (I wrote to them recently, still awaiting a reply) then I have to get a lawyer (probably not happening) and have a facsimile produced. Then 300 euros and a million documents later and I get my passport. I'm really hoping for the best.</p>

<p>All my life I have felt something like the pulse of my ancestors within me, and to unite that feeling with the living, to achieve unity with other individuals, only seems like transcendence.</p>
<p>Blood is my honor and my duty and my destiny. Without it we are mere atoms floating and unguided, moved by any force and separated by the will of others.</p>
<p>Beyond taking our lives, they can never take our blood and heritage away from us. Even if we were lobotomized and rendered deaf and dumb, we would still have our blood, because it is everything.</p>

<p>And to hold your own child is the most simple, purest, and greatest pleasure. What the people of the modern world thew away to desperately grasp a little "youth."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We see this alike in so many ways. I still hardly believe it.</p>
