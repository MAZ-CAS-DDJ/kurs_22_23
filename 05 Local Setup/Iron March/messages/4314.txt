<p>we were just starting to see grass then fucking 6 inches overnight. Some of the farmers are worried that they may not be able to get a crop in. But farmers are crazy and probably will do it even it the field is under a foot of water...... might recomend they grow some wild rice this year if thats the case.</p>
