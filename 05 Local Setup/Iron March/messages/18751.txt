	I'm currently working on making a DIY Weapon for Race War preparation, but I think the concept of it can help you out <em>a lot</em> in your attack.
</p>

<p>
	Get a big tree branch that's some 20" long or more, three to five grooved &gt;3" nails, and duct tape. Pick a part of the branch to use for the nails; hammer the nails just far enough from each other so wood-splitting isn't an issue, and you can duct-tape the splits.
</p>

<p>
	The only issue I've had in this is regular nails being beaten out of their holes after some tests on milk gallons filled with water, so be careful if you're using regular nails; you'll probably need something else to make sure they stay and stay firmly within their holes.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a hardware shop nearby, and a big forest too, this should be easy to make. My guess is that it should take less than two hours to make if you the right set-up and equipment for it before-hand.
</p>

<p>
	Should come out looking like this:

			Set-up for hammering in the nails, cinderblocks and a board of wood(or anything to bring it to your level) is all that's needed:

			The reason I warn against regular nails (disregard it seeming to be broken in half, this is after I sawed the branch so as to reuse the other end this weekend):

	Hope it all goes well, m8.
