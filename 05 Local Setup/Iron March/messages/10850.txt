<p>I'm trying to make sure any evidence of what happened with me isn't on ironmarch or isn't clear as day. This is because if someone knows me in real life and knows what happened with me over the past week, they can identify me on the site and id be in deep shit.</p>
<p>My mother also decided it would be a grand idea to schedule me to meet a fucking rabbi to talk about the holocaust, and if he knows about ironmarch and saw all this he'd probably oy vey so violently that the synagogue would cave in</p>
