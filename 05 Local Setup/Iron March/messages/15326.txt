	Hey Xav, do you know of any books or other resources that really get in dept on how to pray to the Gods and rituals to the Gods? I am just not feeling a connection. Maybe if I were to do a ritual or something. Any books or resources at all really would be helpful, even if it evolves <em>some </em>of the faggotry (but seriously not a lot though) we know is in the neopaganism nowadays.
