	I'm currently contracting in Afghanistan and served as in infantrymen in both Afghainstan and Iraq. I'm always open to networking with people and all the better with fascist. If you are proposing actually starting a PMC than I'm not sure as an American how much involvement I can have because I assume you guys will be European based and I'm not sure how all these legal issues work. In any case if you feel comfortable telling me more I would certainly be interested in hearing what you guys have going on.
