<p>I fail to see the logical basis in a teenager suddenly claiming 'to know how the world works'; this is an ignorant, judgmental view that you have cultivated despite the fact you yourself have not even visited the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Neo-nazis are scumbags and are NOT ideological; the fact you see these men as equatable to the NSDAP, NFP, Falangists, etc. of old is absolutely laughable. It reveals a sharp misunderstanding of proper history.</p>
<p>Before you make the typical Marxian notion and argument that we make the same claim - we do not; we are not imperialists..and if you think we are, you're a moron. Fascism is not imperialism by default and this was Italo Balbo's very criticism of Mussolini (who, by the way, is NOT the theorician of Italian fascism. Giovanni Gentile is.) due to the fact it ran his State into the ground. </p>
<p>We merely claim to understand ourselves, and our own cultures; unlike you - who claims to understand the WHOLE FUCKING WORLD, while only having visited likely less than 5% of it. </p>
<p>Enjoy. I anticipate your response, Marxoid. I, by the way, am a national socialist - of the real, ideological breed, born in Deutschland.</p>
