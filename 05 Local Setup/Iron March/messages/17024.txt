	I still plan to, personally i see our only path to a rise to power being a slow and steady overton window shift leading to education on our stances and legit elections until we are a majority and can eliminate other parties. Militant take over of the USA will never happen, so i find other reading should take priority. Long game politics probably wont even be our path tbh. I'v been talking to some friends about going the local's about going the Golden Dawn route. DO charity, fund raise, stand up for morals in our local community and attack immoral things, help at every food bank that lets us in the door ect ect. Being leaders in the community willÂ inevitably lead to the community making you a leader. On a small scale its great for the hometown and id done in mass and then we network we can render the state useless without actually doing away with it and then (((they))) can get laughed at when they try to tell the people who hold you in the highest regard that you are the bad guy
