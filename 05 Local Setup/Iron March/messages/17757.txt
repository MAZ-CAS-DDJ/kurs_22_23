	Why the fuck did you quote all of that if you aren't going to respond to anything? Not as obnoxious as double posting. The constitution is a piece of paper, you can't uphold it even with a federal govt &amp; w/o one the most basic lies repeated frequently are worthless. A Fascist US would occur by becoming organic states ie we lift ourselves up and the racial hierarchy forms by natural law, because there wouldn't be any more funds to keep the status quo going. Seceding (like segregation) is a political method which I haven't even mentioned. I asked you how you'd accomplish it democratically. Its polite to answer someone when they pose you question, you wouldn't avoid that IRL would you? It would make you look dickless. Online has the advantage of much preparation time. Appropriating symbols for no good reason doesn't help matters either.
