<p>Same shit here, In 2005 i think that the traitor democratic regime is over and there will be true nationalist opposition. And there was a major slap. Now there is indications for strong union between 3 most mass organizations here. But is too early to have some development... Btw how is the weapon issues in Ukraine. Here must have a serious connections to have some gun license but even with (self defence ) gun if you use it you are pretty screwed...</p>
