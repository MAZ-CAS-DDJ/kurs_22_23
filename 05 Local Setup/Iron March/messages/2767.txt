<p>That's a fair accusation. Yes, I'm aware now that I look through my posts that pretty much everybody here believes I am a troll, hoping to accomplish nothing. The truth is that I have never exposed myself to actual pro-fascists. They are very hard to come by, mainly because it seems that nobody besides the internet even knows what fascism is.... Which is quite an unfortunate statement. I'm not sure what you mean by emotionalism though? Do you mean my attempt to incite strong emotions in people with my symbols and speech? Well, you would be correct, I am definitely trying to incite emotional responses and point out the obvious fallacies of fascism and how it is a threat to the human race as a whole. Also, I don't like the way everyone throws around the word "liberal" here. What on earth are you peoples' definition of liberal??</p>
