<p>Do you have skype? If so you should definitely add me, my name is Blood and Iron on there, same avatar as on here.</p>
<p>I would like to visit Portland and even Northern Cali so we should discuss that, if possible. It would have to wait until 2014 though.</p>

<p>I don't have Skype because, until now, I didn't know anyone who used it.  I work nights, so I'm about to go to bed.  Probably tomorrow or Saturday morning I'll sign up and download whatever is necessary.  I'll let you know what my username ends up being.</p>
