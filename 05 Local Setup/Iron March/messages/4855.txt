<p>Mate, a friendly word of advice is to chill your tits. people who take themselves too seriously don't come out so great. I am not sure where you are supposed to 'come from' but emulating Danny Dyer is usually a way to get people in stitches anywhere. It is just my recommendation that you brush off some of these conversations, though you are free do do as you want here. </p>
<p>Just don't take what people say here seriously, it is just how we usually sort through the numpties. </p>
