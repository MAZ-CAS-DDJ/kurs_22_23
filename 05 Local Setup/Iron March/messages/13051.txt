	Okay breh it's working now. <br />
	Sorry for the late reply, I kept trying to send a message but it was redirecting me to some blank webpage.<br /><br />
	Yeah basically I wanted to get a meetup going since I want to get more active in the movement, irl that is. It's the IronMarch year of action after all. therightstuff.biz only runs their 'standard pool parties' once a month and they are more libertarians that care about white genocide than actual fascists.<br /><br />
	Meeting up with others in a public place during the day is pretty low risk unless you've done some dumb shit online. Smh when you send an anti-Semitic tweet to an MP and get 3 years jail.<br /><br />
	Anyway if you actually want to meet up, it can be on your terms if you want. Just keep in mind that I'm 17 so I can't drink or do anything you have to be 18 years old to do. Only family friendly fascist fun for this goy. I've got some friends that can come along as well but I'm not sure if they'd want to. I can convince maybe 2-3 to come along with me. <br /><br />
	Cheers.
