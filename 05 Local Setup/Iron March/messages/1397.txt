<p>Nope. They literally thought I was advocating for this at the current time under the current circumstances, despite myself prefacing the thread about how it was all idealism and unattainable in almost all instances. I had to reiterate that in almost every subsequent post and no one latched on. I drew comparison to The Republic, citing some of the more outlandish claims of Plato. Again, no one got it. Hell, being asthmatic and having ADD would have kept me out of my own ideal society, another point I raised and again, no one got it. Notice a trend?</p>
