	Yes it was good, and no worries man. I was pretty tired myself actually, I didn't sleep the best the night before. But it went good and looking forward to the big meet up mid-April. Im going to be bringing out another fresh face we met recently to it as well. Things are picking up pretty good here I'd say.Â

	Rob and Shawn said they think you both were good stuff too. So we would definitely be interested in having you check out more about what we are and all that!
