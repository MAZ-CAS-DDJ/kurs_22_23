<p>Hello, comrade. I am curious, as a 'Radical Traditionalist', what exactly are your ideals and beliefs? I consider myself a bit of a traditionalist, and plenty consider my beliefs and actions to be radical. I always enjoy discussing viewpoints and ideologies with such minded individuals. </p>
<p>With honours,</p>
