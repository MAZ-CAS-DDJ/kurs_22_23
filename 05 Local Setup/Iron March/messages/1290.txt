<p>I figured I'd PM you so I can have this discussion with someone who doesn't coil in fear at talking with an unashamed anti-semite.</p>
<p>As far as anti-semitism goes it's a matter of cleanliness. <a href="http://www.toqonline.com/blog/evolas-anti-semitism/" rel="external nofollow">I take Evola's stance on anti-semitism</a>; it's obviously not every kike that's a conspiring bastard, but most jews go along with it and decry people as bigots without really asking why people feel that way and in fact fuel hatred and are being passive towards these parasitical actions in the Jew community and it comes off as a collective mentality. Let's put it this way, I would never trust a Jew who identified with the Jewish people and acted like a jew. It's just a matter of ethnocentrism; they've historically been a subversive element wherever they've been, they're vastly different in character, spirituality and even biology.</p>
<p>There's truth to the protocols as well. Most dismiss it as conspiracy nonsense, but looking at the history of it supposedly being proven as a fraud is on par with the Nuremberg trials... dismissed when there really isn't any actual evidence there at all.</p>

<p>I think that kind of anti-semitic literature along with the rest of banjo_billy's stuff is exactly the kind of stuff that will turn people. I was certainly transfixed when I read his stuff.</p>
<p>The fact is Jews are overrepresented in all that is wrong in the world and let us not forget that it was a Jew who conceived communism. I believe communism to be the embodiment of Jewishness and the victim culture. Marxist-Leninism deviates a little bit from Trotskyism (theoretical/cultural Marxism) but it isn't that much better. Jews are always looking to blame someone else but themselves. As I've said though, Jews can transcend their Jewishness. Hitler's Jewish soldiers is proof of that as well. He gave some jews a pass if they converted to catholic. Granted they mainly only had 1/8th or 1/16th Jewish ancestry.</p>
