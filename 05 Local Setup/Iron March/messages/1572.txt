<p>Hey, I noticed you've said you are on the Primal Diet, how are you liking it so far? I was on it for a long time and went from 300lbs down to 220lbs. The amount of weight I dropped compared to the effort involved was insane. I recommend it to everyone. Right now I am 215 but with 20-22% body fat so I meet Army requirements. I'd still be on the diet if some life events hadn't happened making fresh food and the amount needed nearly impossible to obtain. </p>
<p>I'm actually starting the "Warrior Diet" tomorrow which looks pretty interesting. Not sure if you are familiar with it. Regardless just want to show my support for a fellow proponent of the primal lifestyle.</p>
