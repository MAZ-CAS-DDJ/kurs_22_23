But a specifically youth wing of the movement will have to exist as such, because young people much prefer to hang out with other young people, doing the kinds of things young people like to do (of the non-degenerate variety in this case.)</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">Anyway, re: GI it’s important to remember that we don’t have to copy any one aspect of their approach, because after all we shouldn’t be trying to imitate anyway – we should be trying to go one better. That’s how you know a movement is alive: when its constituents aren’t content to be also-rans but are actively seeking to be its most superior version. The moment they’re happy to be just another… the movement’s dead. I want to do better than the GIs on the continent, and have them copy us.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">And if you’re referring to the New Right’s adoption of left-wing strategy then that’s fine with me (I’m currently reading Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals, as it happens…)</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">I just started a private chat with The Fool on Lumine Boreali, the other day, about getting the New Right to spread out a bit across the British Isles OR us ourselves making that happen. I’ll add you to the conversation.</span></span></span></p>
