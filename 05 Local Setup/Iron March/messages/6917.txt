<p>In America race is almost irrelevant, we have no real ethnic heritage, we can trace our roots back accross the world. The majority of the population trace their heritage either to Europe or Africa. Blacks have been an integral part of American history since its creation, they are just as American, if not more american than the WNs here. They bear the brunt of what the current system has to offer--if fascism is to have any success it must gain support not just from people of European Ancestry, but also with those of African ancestry. I think race--at least here in the US-- is irrelevant. We have no "american race", we are peoples from all around the world, our nationalism cannot be based on ethnicity, as we have no common ethnicity.</p>
