<p>Thanks mang, it'd be good to have a thread up about this (if there isn't already one), it could be intriguing to see what reactions follow - also could turn to a dumping ground of evidence, counter arguments and so forth. It's a shame that the older racialist posters are either banned or gone (ethnonationalist, etc) no doubt they'd be able to contribute.</p>
