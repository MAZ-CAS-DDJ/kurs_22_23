<p>I like listening to metal, and luckily that scene is less retarded than the mainstream pop culture, with some cool people in it. Most of my friends prefer going to a pub rather than to a club, so that's great too. I'd rather sit over a glass of beer and talk about stuff than dance in a club. Next time I visit Sofia I'm probably going to check out this place: <a href="http://rocknrolla.bg/" rel="external nofollow">http://rocknrolla.bg/</a></p>
<p>Rock music club with a bar section where you can just sit down and chill, sounds like a pretty cool place and reminds me of one not-too-shitty place in my city in Germany.</p>

<p>Drugged people on parties are the worst, yeah. A great majority of the people on my uni smoke weed occasionally, and on parties some people take those fucking pills so they can "dance longer" or somesuch reason. Ultimate degeneracy, at least I read that the Bulgarian law is very harsh on owning and consuming drugs. The worst thing among modern youth is the "YOLO"-culture that is all about doing retarded things because you only live once, so you should try out every degeneracy you can. I hope that's just a temporary teenage fad that goes away in a few years.</p>
