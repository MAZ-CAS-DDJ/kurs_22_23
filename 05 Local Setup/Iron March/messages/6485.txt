<p>I don't have a denomination - because like you I don't know of anywhere that agrees with the doctrines/worldview I do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was raised a Jehovah's Witness believe it or not, and their issues go far beyond politics and war. I'd sooner become a branch davidian than revert to the Jehovah's Witnesses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But yeah, rejecting the trinity is good. Great in fact. I shouldn't bad mouth the Witnesses too much because if I'd been raised a Catholic or whatever, I'd probably believe in the trinity to this very day. It's a sinister doctrine that uses subtle word tricks, and 1600 years of accumulated deception and indoctrination to make a ridiculous idea somehow seem plausible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arianism however, isn't correct. I actually believed it myself until relatively recently but it has some major flaws and I've come to see it as trinitarianism-lite. Now you liked a video I posted before by the trinity delusion - the guy is great, he has so many great videos and pages on his website that just grind the trinity into the dust. Some of them also disprove Arianism, however, and I think you should take a look.</p>
