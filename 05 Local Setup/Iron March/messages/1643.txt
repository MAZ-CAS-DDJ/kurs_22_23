<p>That is because after the liberation 1878 was created a "San-Stepfano Bulgaria" wich include most of the Bulgarian ethnic territories. But 3 mounts after that the peace treaty between Russia and Ottoman Empire was revised in "Berlinian Congress" where the great powers divide Bulgaria brutally. From various reasons. The British fear that Russia as liberator will have strong influence and get a way to the Middeterranian and even if that didnt happen strong indipendent Bulgaria in center of Balkans will be a major treat to British interests in Greece who were British puppil So they insist Aegean and Eastern Thrace to be return to Turkey. The Austria-Hungary  see in Bulgarian a treat to their  own  interests in region via their puppils the Serbs insist Vardar and Aegean Macedonia also return to Turkey who was weak to defend them and via that the English and Austria-Hungary make some kind of "gift" to Serbia and Greece. Other part wich is central Trace was also bring in Turkey but in form of Autonomy so called "Eastern Romelia" and finaly Principality of Bulgaria who must be monarchy but his king must be apointed by "the Great Powers" The most famous phrase of that congress was from Otto Von Bismarck who stated "Gentleman's we gathered here to secure peace of Europe not the joy of Bulgarians"  ..... And shit like that who lead to 6 wars and that is how in every family there is someone who fight in the front....</p>
