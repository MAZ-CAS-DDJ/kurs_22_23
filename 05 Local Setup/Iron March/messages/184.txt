<p>While I can see where you're coming from, I have to disagree. The black community suffers mainly from a 'ghetto' effect. Namely the effect of innate economic disadvantages coupled with still-existing discrimination working against upward mobility. We also need to disperse the ghetto population to destroy the subculture and encourage greater assimilation whilst keeping the Southern and American traditions and heritage alive. It all comes down to environment.</p>
