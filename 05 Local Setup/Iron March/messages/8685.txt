<p>No not yet, I hope to though, Make something of a Pilgramage across Europe at some point, visit the lands of my Ancestors, the Graves of Martyrs, Jose Antonios' and Benito Mussolinis' come to mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As well as just taking in the landscape and less poltical sites, Vienna always seemed like a gorgeous City to visit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Would also be cool to meet up with the Euros on this site.</p>
