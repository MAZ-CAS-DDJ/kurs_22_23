<p>I will layout my beliefs on aliens before I watched the video. I believe that there are two alien races in a constant war with each other and that a third race acts as slaves to both but mainly one of them.</p>
<p>I believe the first race and the ones who created us to be the 'Nordic aliens' tall white humanoids of Germanic appearance, of great strength, intelligence, benevolence and psychic ability. I believe they created most of humanity with White people being the favoured.</p>
<p>I believe their adversaries to be Reptilian, similar to what David Icke describes, I believe them to have created or influenced a small sect of the Semitic people. I believe the purpose of these to be to destroy the human race and the seed of which, this cult has passed on to Ashkenazi Jews and to white leaders through bloodline and indoctrination.</p>
<p>The third race are the grey aliens, mere slaves, scientists and such.</p>
<p>I believed we were engineered to survive here, to secure this rock or to develop to be of service to the gods.</p>
<p>The video was greatly interesting. The idea that we were bred with the apes is an interesting idea, the idea that the gods returned to breed with beautiful human females may explain why the blacks are so primitive (they have less of the annunaki/aesir/olympian etc.) blood in them.</p>
<p>You seem to know more than me even. I'm slowly learning that to National Socialists, this stuff is standard.</p>
