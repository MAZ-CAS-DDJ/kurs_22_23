<p>Yea. I don't feel I could ever be a white nationalist. I don't feel more superior to my nephew or the majority of my friends at school, reading Strasser makes me consider nationalism more seriously from when I was a communist not too long ago. I don't think I'll ever publicly call myself a national socialist because of the negative sentiment with the term. </p>
