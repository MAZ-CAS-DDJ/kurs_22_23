	Yeah, they are gradually weening me off the pills. I have been on some form of anxiety/ocd medication since middle school, so they can't take me off cold turkey. My meds have already been cut back, with plans to cut them back more and then cut them off totally. If all goes well in 2-3 months I should be off of them. I am just done relying on some pills to make me happy. I am going to make my own happiness.
