	It's definitely a dream of mine. I saw them on social media long before I joined here, and after I lurked IM I've found them to be the best thing happening right now in the states. At this point I wouldn't even consider joining any other group. Right now I'm working on a little 3 year plan for myself but the first year might not be an entire year. Year one: join IM, lurk and learn as much as I can. Second year join AD and year three form my own chapter where I live unless there already is one that I'm not aware of. Do you know if there's a chapter in Indianapolis?
