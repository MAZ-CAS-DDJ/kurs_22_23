<p>Fascist since 6th grade? Damn, son. That's fuckin' young. I got into politics around that time, but I was sperging with lolbertarianism and anarchism. Over the years I flip-flopped between left and right, but when I re-joined this site after my hiatus I came to the revelation that fascism was something more than ideology. It wasn't just a party program, but it was something much bigger. It was a worldview, and I realized that I've always seen the world in such a way.</p>
