<p>They are somewhat well read. Internationalism is not bad if it means empire building, like revolutionary syndicalists that made Italian Fascism advocating social nationalism, and conquering countries like Libya, Ethiopia... Bringing back the Roman Empire. Which would essentially mean multiculturalism.</p>
<p>I think most of them are scared to abandon Christianity even though Jesus would disagree with them if alive today--assuming they did not call him a kike and despise him. Their fear I think is mostly from a subconscious belief in hell and a belief that being anti-christian or anti-christ is something that alienates them from a vast number of Europeans who believe in Revelations.</p>
<p>It would be a bad Public Relations move for too many Fascists to be anti-Christian, because then it would support some right-wing claims that "Hitler was an anti-christ" and such. Alienating whites. Especially ones that would see such a behavior as a fulfillment of Christian prophecy.</p>

<p>Anyway, I agree with you. Protestantism had a point when it opposed Jews and the Catholic Church. It did not want outside control. However, it was a failure (or at least inconsistent with the doctrine of Jesus) because maintaining Christianity and hating Catholics and Jews is a contradiction.</p>
<p>A truly free Northern people would not be Christian or Jewish or Hindu or Muslim or anything else that originated anywhere except along the Oder or Donau rivers. Or something that can claim truly spiritual, non-political (the main failure of Rosenberg NS), but Aryan origins. But something that emphasizes morality and ethics in addition to national/racial solidarity.</p>
<p>They don't really believe in white independence though. And when I say white I am not including nations under the Alps.</p>
<p>Reconciling Romans--as the people who went north and forcibly converted and slaughtered whites--with the sons of Vikings and good non-Marxist people who worshiped nature and life is silly.</p>
