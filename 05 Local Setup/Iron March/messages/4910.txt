<p>lol too right; repetition is the key, people will disagree at first but when they start to see for themselves it begins to register. It works the other way though like Hitler said about the big lie; if it's repeated often enough people begin to believe it. I'm just glad woman in black is gone and hopefully Irisher goes soon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my cousin thinks he's a fag but I don't let him live it down, I stand firm on my principles. He's never done anything mind you because he's a fat virgin who only ever leaves the house to go to work, it doesn't make a bit of difference to me though I always tease him and make fun of him for it when I see him. It's school yard style, I make it obvious I find it disgusting and wrong but I'm not all like "hurrr kill the fags ... why you such a fag, fag" because it makes them just think you're ignorant. I just make fun of him and say he'd have a prolapsed rectum and have to wear huggies by the time he's 30 and just say "that's so gross, dude, how's that normal". When he goes on about "love" I just bring up the paedo argument and liken it to that or say "what would you know about love, you're a virgin". It serves the point much better. Once he stops being so weird I'm gonna take him to the local massage parlour and straighten him out. There're some stunners there.</p>

<p>That's what I loved about Nazi Germany, they weren't too anal on drug use, they had brothels all over the country and even in the concentration camps, guns were allowed unless you were a kike or a criminal, they weren't prudes; they were just fun loving normal people who loved their own. I've never been an anti-Nazi even when bombarded with the propaganda at school but it just goes to show that everything most people know about the NSDAP is wrong.</p>

<p>That's something I made an argument for as a "Christian" too, that prostitution is okay... so long as it's not temple prostitution, lmao. Temple prostitution's actually the best kind I'd imagine, lol. There's a matter of being too open with sexuality, like kikes and homos are but being a prude is far from normal. Basically, have fun but have some dignity and responsibility was the fascist way. That's part of the reason why people don't take fascist youths seriously, because they're nerdy.</p>
