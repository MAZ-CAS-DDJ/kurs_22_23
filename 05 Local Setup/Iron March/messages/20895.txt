	Greetings,

	I see a reoccurring theme here on IM that I generally steer clear from, and that is the miscommunication that invariably transpires whenever TWP takes part in anything.  This can be seen dating all the way back to Sacramento, when people were saying, "TWP allies with dumb skinheads, that's not true National Socialism!"  A year later people here quote that day as a testament to our strength.  Today, I see people here yet again thinking that because we have been invited to show our strength to a large number of people that we have compromised our position.  I do not expect IM to see things my way, which is why I don't join these conversations.  Each time we go to these events we risk our lives, we take casualties, we shed blood, this is what we do.  All for the sake of National Socialism, for our immortal souls, to show our uncompromising resolve against the Jew.  IM sees an "alliance" rather than an opportunity to show the strength of our own position, that uncompromising National Socialism is the only way.  <br /><br />
	I don't expect to change anyone's mind, nor do I care to do so.  In a few short weeks I will face off against thousands of Jewish minions and spread the ideals of National Socialism to the world, and I may very well lose my life in doing so.  I have made good friends here on IM, but if you expect me to denounce the people who have shed blood with me, stood with me on the front lines against the Jewish hordes for years, you may go ahead and terminate my account.  I am loyal to my ideals, and thus loyal to those who stand with me upon those ideals.<br /><br />
	Thank you for your compliment.
