<p>It even says on my profile! 80s action movies!</p>

<p>I hate bloody CGI, and shakycam, and these gay pseudo-romantic modern action movies with main characters who look like fuckin' male underwear models or something. I like campy old action movies. Especially if they have Schwarzenegger, Willis, Stallone, Gibson, etc in them. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_laugh.png" alt=":lol:" /> I also like serious war movies, some westerns mostly because that's all my father would watch, and some silly comedy movies.</p>

<p>How 'bout you lass?</p>
