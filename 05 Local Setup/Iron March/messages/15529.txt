	So.

	It is only a partial truth what you are saying. Of course it is madness that every political force wants to become maintsream, but we need that type of movements also. There is no universal solution, we have to build a network of different organizations and work like an army: with a lot of various branches. Also that's true that most of these "movements" are a joke, but if you look at the "Traditionalist Worker Party" for example, there is not that big difference between them and the "National Action", and while we are ridiculing the former, we respect the latter. A lot of people are just not ready yet, don't blame them.

	I am also a weak fuck unfortunately. I exercise very rarely, I work with computers, so you can imagine. I mean, I am not a fat bastard, but I have a beer belly. I am also unfamiliar with weapons, but in Hungary it is almost impossible to get weapons and practice shooting. I am also very far from being a father. I don't say anybody have to accept that, since I don't, and I will change, but until then this is what I have.

	You say there is an information war, and that's true. That's why I have joined to IronMarch. I really want to help our cause with my research.

	About the self-sustainable community, it is a very good idea, but it is crucial not to loose contat with the global world. I have also always had a plan like yours, a community where there are no enemies, only true brothers. Are you familiar with the <a href="http://golden-dawn-international-newsroom.blogspot.hu/p/the-green-wing-and-volksland.html" rel="external nofollow">The Green Wing and the Volksland Project of Golden Dawn?</a> For me reading about this was like a dream coming true. That's why I want to establish connections with every Fascist organization, to be able to use every good ideas and improve every one of them.
