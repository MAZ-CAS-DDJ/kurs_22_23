	Are there are going to be any major actions or demonstrations during summer in Poland? I would love to come, maybe take couple of my friends. This could be the beggining of something wonderful, there nationalists from Poland and Lithuania forget about the past and start thinking about the Europe as a sanctuary for white people.Â
