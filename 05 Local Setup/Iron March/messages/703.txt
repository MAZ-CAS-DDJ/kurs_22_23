<p>Alright. This sounds mostly in agreement with what I believe, although I favour a somewhat stronger and more central (corporate) state-- I'm trying to find a balance between the benefits of centralism and decentralism, and distributism is helping me in that regard. I definitely think that suggesting people leave is a much better way to deal with dissidence than the simple method of execution that most dictatorships have tried.</p>
<p>On a slightly different topic, what's the difference between Wodenism and more general Germanic heathenry?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I disagree with execution and militarism in general. There are some people who I find outright disturbing and annoying but as long as they do not represent a direct threat to the folk community than I see no reason to kill them, they can go live in communities centered around their own interests. We also have to take into account how capitalist consumer culture and liberalism effects the untrained mind now a days. </p>
<p>I haven't read much on distributism to be honest, any good links? I might already be familiar with some of the concepts. I think, in the USA, where there is a great deal of ethnic diversity a strong state could be a problem because than different groups suffer from under-representation and others sometimes get over representation, therefore the will of one group is pushed onto another. For example in American history many minority groups such as blacks had major under representation but today "minorities" are clearly over represented even to the point that us Europeans have lost total contact with our roots (though again Capitalist consumer culture and liberalism have a great hand in this as well - but they act through legislation). </p>
<p>I am not sure what you mean by the question, but Wodenism, Odinism, Wotanism, etc etc are virtually the same religion. Germanic heathenry is just another word used to describe them. Usually there are different ideas within the religion though.</p>
<p>For example thanks to people like David Lane within the white nationalist movement saying you are a Wotanist usually means you have either an atheistic and almost dogmatic might is right theology or have an occultic might is right theology. </p>
<p>I enjoy reading about the occult, but that is really it. I identify as either an Odinist or Wodenist to avoid being confused for a follower of Lane.</p>
