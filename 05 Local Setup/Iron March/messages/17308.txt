	Its not necessarily about fascism, so much as it is about producing a cultural shift towards thinking about white identity with modern lingo and symbolism. Memes are a effective way of doing that buts mainly about creating a new culture that can overtime encroach upon the mainstream &amp; make normal what was usually considered unthinkable like realizing that there are major limitations of egalitarianism which is what underpins Libertarianism, Capitalism and Democracy. Neoreactionaries do a better job at critiquing democracy but I think the Alt-right is quite well on the way to defeating the fantasy of equality. That is that women and men are better at different roles, and races do not get along with each other. Thats race realism and not "racism" or irrational fear/hatred.

	All the alt-light where exposed and segregated socially. Race-mixing kike faggots aren't going to get much headway in the alt-right due to social segregation. Not disavowed because people on the right should not ever go against people who fight against the left, working together is superior &amp; the only way to win. I understand that the opposition to Capitalism and Democracy are not goals of the Alt-right (thats more the domain of Neoreactionaries but they don't have alternatives). They are against globalism which is arguably the main aspect of Capitalism that people don't like. Its also more accessible than the idea of mercantalism &amp; top-down run economy. I'm not totally against that idea because I'm not sure if the Globalist elements can be defeated within a Capitalist system but banning dual citizenship that would prevent foreigners from operating within politics/media/banking would go a long way as a solution.

	Politicians understand the need to build constituencies &amp; make coalitions/partnerships for common interests. Which is to say, the point of the New Right or Alt-right is to turn normal people who believe in the status quo (which is liberalism as much as they like to think they aren't) into traditionalists/absolutists (we don't use those words so as to not scare aware normies but we basically are). Basically the alt-right is creating new culture from the perspective of a traditionalists, rather than simply relying on older authors and books, they are producing new content and doing it from the perspective of modern evidence/knowledge &amp; eschewing what previously didn't work while developing new vocabulary &amp; symbols that the average person can use to explain more complex socio-economic subjects.

	One reason why priests and politicians have great power is the ability to make symbols that previously had little or waning relevance to instead have new meaning, or resurrect symbols for new circumstances. While also taking the advantages that the left usually had. Which is to say to create a subculture and have that encroach upon and influence the mainstream culture and enter public awareness &amp; doing so in the best way a dissident movement can, by being decentralized so that no "figure head" can be coopted or eliminated by the establishment. Another is using meme magic to infuse truth and emotion into messages that people can absorb, thus manifesting ideas into reality through what we would call in the olden days as 'sigils'. Since human beings are mostly ruled by passion, this makes it quite effective. Being able to influence on a massive scale by utilising the very power of the internet itself, the ultimate decentralized tool for the masses.

	Basically the Alt-right is a workers revolution of whites across western society adapting to the modern age WITHOUT the need for another Hitler to come along that the fascists mistakenly wait for. We can have lots of smaller leaders in thousands of groups. Hitler used the new tools of the day (film making) to unleash its true power, if he was alive today he would view internet in the same way (the establishment has failed to use social media effectively). You understand now that this is the future? The future is now, its just you guys haven't adapted as well as the Alt-right has. I and tens of thousands of new traditionalists/absolutists that is the alt-right is proof that this kind of culture/metapolitics creation, white identity politics using new knowledge &amp; methods that utilize new tools works. This is why I believe there is progress being made towards a right-wing future.
