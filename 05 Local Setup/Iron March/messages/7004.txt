<p>Back in the 80s and 70s before my time they used to go abroad here and ambush the shops for the latest clobber so they had it before it reached the shelves in the UK. The most sure fire way of knowing who a hooligan here is not so much if they wear stone island but if they have a GENUINE Burberry cap and Stone Island, lol. Most here just wear crosshatch, firetrap and Henry Lloyd when they're going for a good punch up, but I think that's more to do with chavvies coming into it who can't afford proper stone island. Fred Perry's still popular here.</p>
<p>I can relate to the away games and I experienced it last Saturday at Derby's Wembley game against QPR. I took a mate along with me who has only recently just started getting into going to matches, he had a right laugh but I've never seen somebody get so rat arsed so quickly, it was good to see all the lads again. We could do with a thread dedicated to stories like this. Your posts here have been brilliant recently, it's the exact thing a forum like this needs. It's a good thing to be knowledgeable, logical and know how to have fun at the same time too. Every other forum is all doom and gloom or trying to keep up appearances for the sake of looking respectable. The more people we can encourage to casually enjoy a good fight and a bit of mischief the better.</p>
<p>I'll give that film a watch.</p>
