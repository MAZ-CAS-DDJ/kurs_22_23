<p>Allright, it looks like we got pretty good NRM article translator gang around here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Decided to make this "chat" so we could do somekind of cooperation and put on requests etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So lets update what is the status of our translators shall we?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Noidberg, translates from Swedish site, cant translate that active? </p>
<p>Balder,Translates from Norwegian site, How actively could you translate?</p>
<p>Nordic, translates from Norwegian and Swedish site, How actively could you translate?</p>
<p>Me, translates from Finnish site, i translate atleast one per week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Best case scenario would be if you guys could translate 1 article per week, but more the better, this will keep the thread active, give international "publicity" to NRM material. Also this advertises NRM which is the point of the thread obviously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you wanna translate articles, if there has been any recent events,happenings that has something to do with NRM, those are top priority, also more "fresher" articles the better. But any article will do.</p>
