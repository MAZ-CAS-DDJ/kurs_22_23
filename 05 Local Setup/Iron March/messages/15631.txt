	We use a Polish messager called Gigi for the most part. We also text each other lol. Its difficult because we're in a couple countries. The other group is just IRL so it's just in person and text.

	As for the ethno-state... I think Europe should be for their Nationalities in their own ethno-states. Europe needs to be devided up even more into true ethno-states as they see fit. A great example is Belgium. Countries like the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand should be general white countries, as were all a mix of European ancestry anyway.
