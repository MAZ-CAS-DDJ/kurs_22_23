<p>Hello mate,</p>
<p>I just saw a graphic you designed entitled 'Early Signs of Fascism' - assuming I am correct and it is your own work - I don't suppose it would be possible for you to design some propaganda for me. </p>
<p>I usually rely on Ben, but he is busy at the moment and I hate to distract him when he is working on what should be an extremely fruitful project.</p>
