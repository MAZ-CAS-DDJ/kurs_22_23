<p>Thanks!  It seems like you can't walk down the street without hearing someone bawwing about scarcity.  Lefties think Mother Gaia is on her last leg (I love George Carlin's take on this.  Are you familiar with it?)  NatSocs think whitie is going to drown in a sea of mud people (the most reasonable of all scarcity-related anxiety), and capitalist think the price of everything will rise, trigger massive inflation, and make them side with NatSoc over Marxism.  It's ridiculous!</p>
<p>That being said, I find scarcity-related fear-mongering preferable to technophobia.  At least the illusion of scarcity has given us recycling and other efficiency-improving technology.  Technophobia is just a result of a world view where human society has been and will be frozen in its current state.  I mean, what are the societal ramifications of an embedded neural processor when compared to the Neolithic Revolution.  The inability to acknowledge the changing nature of humanity is, to me, reactionary thought of the worst order.</p>
