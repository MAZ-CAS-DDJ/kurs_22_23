<p>I forgot to say in my previous message that I am not looking  for my air fare to be paid... (like some other comments) I just need a contact and a place where I can stay while I talk to the correct people.....I also forgot to mention that I have experience in First Aid.....and also very much experience in logistics......He also serves who only stands and waits.   ..John Milton.</p>
<p>Also I am willing to serve in anyway....with anyone...I am not seeking glory...just the destiny of my race before Odin.</p>
