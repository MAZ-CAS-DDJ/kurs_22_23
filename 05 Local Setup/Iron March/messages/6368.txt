<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">Hmm... not too sure I get the angle you're approaching from...</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">I'll start with a popular quote that you may have heard:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;"><em>"I am the leader of one country which has two alphabets, three languages, four religions, five nationalities, six states, surrounded by seven neighbors, a country in which live eight ethnic minorities."</em></span><div style="margin-left:40px;"><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">— Josip Broz Tito</span></div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">That was the theory anyway (his propaganda to the outside world).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">The reality according to some was kinda close, while others claim it to be utter nonsense.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">Firstly, by way of Socialist rule (Tito's brand of communism), there was no accepted religion, as he propagated Atheism. Fervent religious supporters were commonly persecuted, sometimes politically, other times literally (exiled or shot in extreme cases) so people kept their heads low (my family is a key example of having been closet-Catholics for many years).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">Two alphabets is correct - both were taught at all levels of education, and that education in itself was quite superior to most modern standards.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">Three languages - again, one of Tito's favorite things was to refer to Yugoslavia's language as "Serbo-Croatian", something which to my utter anger still seems to permeate into the 21st century despite having no logical or rational meaning - Yes there are similarities between Croatian and Serbian (and Bosnian), and people can understand each other across language barriers fairly well, but for all intents and purposes/definitions, they are the cultural/lingual representations of separate nations/peoples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">And then of course there is Slovenian, separate again, and dissimilar enough to the former 2/3 to not be easily understood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">Macedonian/Montenegrin is again an offshoot of Serbian, but with enough Albanian and Greek influences to be classed separately again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">Despite all of this, the official language of Yugoslavia remained "Serbo-Croatian" well past the lifetime of the actual nation of Yugoslavia.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">The geographical quips aside, the fact was that there were most certainly MANY MORE than 8 ethnic minorities living within the Yugoslavian borders. To put it more accurately, those 8 so called "minorities" were in fact the MAJORITIES in each respective state (Slovenian, Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, and whatever the new Kosovo/Vojvodina decides to call themselves).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">In between these were many "breeds" of either multiple of the above, or intermixed with other nations (some which no longer exist, e.g. Austro-Hungarian Empire), Jews, Roma/Gypsies, etc.. - and these made up the true minorities... their exact count is hard to describe accurately, especially since the war - which has either decimated or largely dispersed a lot of them.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">Arguing which of these majorities were "favorites" or the "better off" ones is a far too complex subject for even me to delve into - but rest assured the fact remains that not all were treated equally.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">So, again, I'm not sure how accurately that answered your query about multiculturalism in ex-Yugoslavia, but just remember that much of what was presented to the outside world wasn't exactly representative of the truth among the citizens that had to deal with actually living there.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">Many people would still argue that Yugoslavia and all its cultural "contents" were only held together by Tito's iron will/fist; and no surprise to anyone, shortly after he died, the house of cards came tumbling rapidly and brutally... which again begs the question - how much cohesion was there to begin with inside the 7-state nation?</span></p>
