<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I was going to reply to your Shinto conversion thread, Steel, firstly to add my two cents on the matter, which would largley have been a Nietzsche plug (regarding <em>Thus Spake Zarathustra</em> which I consider to be a fundamentally <em>religious</em> text) and to query your seeming compulsion for a formalised religious practice - as a matter of curiosity. And then, after the vitriol you recieved and your lament that the thread had devolved to shit and the only real critique was that Shinto wasn't 'western' I was going to reply to that and concur.</p>
<p>I'll check out that forum out before long, cheers.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I will be Frank, I have only known one person who has the articulate skill in writing as you and he is on the forum I recommended.</p>
<p>As per your Query; My disire for the formalized religion branches from my personal belief on polythiesm as opposed to monothiesm. Since my lack of faith in Christianity I yearned for some sort of ritualism to ease my spiritual side of thought. Shinto brought to me active Practices to participate in as well as genuine faith brought on by belief in my ancestors watching over me all brought into this one religion that was standing directly infront of me.</p>
