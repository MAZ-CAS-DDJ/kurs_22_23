<p>Oh really Ben laughed and stuff LOL NO WAY!!!!! Thanks for the intel, I really don't care. I edited the post after reading up on the man. I wasn't gonna have the only thread on Degrelle be a retarded guess. From what I've read Rexism is wayyy more clerical than National Socialism was, what with its pagan motifs and leader worship and all.</p>
<p>And FYI I don't hate Hitler or dislike most of the ideas behind National Socialism. I simply don't agree with aspects of it (race first nation second is one) and I despise people who think the carbon copied ideals and symbolism of a foreign country 80 years ago would resonate or are even meaningful in the same way today. If Rexism had been carbon-copied National Socialism I would've thought less of Degrelle, which is why I put the disclaimer up there. Not because "hurr durr me no likey Hitler." Take a couple deep breaths before being posting and maybe we can actually discuss something without personal insults.</p>
