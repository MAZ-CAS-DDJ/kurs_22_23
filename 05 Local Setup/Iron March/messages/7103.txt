<p>I had to google first one, makes more sense in this version: "<i><strong>Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando </strong>Invenies Occultum Lapidem</i> ("<strong>Visit the Interior Parts of the Earth; by Rectification</strong> Thou Shalt Find the Hidden Stone")</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>2nd one is "Through/by means of the cross to the roses". It's similar to famous saying ad astra per aspera (through hardships to the stars)</p>
