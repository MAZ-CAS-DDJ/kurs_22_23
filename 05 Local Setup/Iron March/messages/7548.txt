<p>I translated some Serbian RAC song for that girl here on IM, "bear", who's learning Croatian (Croatian and Serbian are basically the same language). I thought I'd post it to you too, it's basically one of those evergreen skinhead anthems here, everyone from the scene knows it by heart. These song always gave me extra motivation and made me emotional, perfect song about our fascist life and what our basic ideal is. I also love the voice of the singer, you can simply hear the sound of booze and cigarettes <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> I think that's what the leftists are the most jealous of, we have the only real underground anti-system music scene in the world, these RAC bands are prohibited and censured in a lot of countries and only people from the scene can attend their concerts, yet they produce tons of cool music. Many RAC musicians are on the other side of the law too... I think more quality people were recruited to the scene by music than through anything else.</p>

<p>The title of the song "naš put" means "our [fascist/NS] way/path" The word "put" means way or path in Croatian/Serbian, figuratively it could mean the path you walk on in your life, in the sense of your mission, ideal. In this case this is the fascist way/path, our life.</p>

<p>I know that the [fascist] path/way I walk on leads to the truth, that's why I'm not afraid</p>
<p>I know that this [fascist] path/way is sincere and honourable</p>
<p>I will walk on it until my end</p>
<p>I'll carry the name of this path within me until my life keeps me afloat</p>
<p>I would never betray it and let darkness fall on its light</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And when Death takes me with her</p>
<p>And when they'll drop my heart like a cold stone</p>
<p>To keep my secret with grave</p>
<p>In other heats the flame will burn</p>
<p>That's when others will defend you</p>
<p>And walk quietly on your [fascist] path/way</p>
<p>Never thinking only about their self-interest</p>
<p>That's why NO ONE WILL EVER DEFEAT YOU!</p>
