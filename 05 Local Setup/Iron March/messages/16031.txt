	We've talked to several organizations like Falanga (on this site) and individuals who are extremely Nationalistic. These movements are stagnant in my opinion and are more political than militant. My group doesn't care for politicians and I certainly don't see any reason to either. I prefer doing over talking. We're still in the blueprint phase, so ideas are being devised by the day. I'm pretty busy for the most part. This project is done in my freetime. I have to balance out gym, school, and work, and then maybe have the time to work on the group.

	The members in Poland are serving in the Straz Graniczna (Armed Border Guard) and officer schools. Eventually they will start recruiting like-minded people. The main goal is reach official state sponsorship from the Polish Government. Kind of like how Serbia sponsored Paramilitaries in Republika Srpska and Kosovo. We cant use the Fascist image though, or we will be labeled as fanatics.
