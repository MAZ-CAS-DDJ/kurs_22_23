<p>Oh yeah, chalga, my Bulgarian pal told me about how obnoxious chalga culture is. It's kinda like the rap/hiphop culture in the west, with the ideals of being a rich gangster and fucking many women being propagated by it. My god, I never understood how women can ruin themselves like that, with tanned skin and bleached hair and silicone tits, they look fucking grotesque. At least the chalga crowd is easy to identify due to the way they dress and can safely be avoided.</p>

<p>The lower level of political correctness is one of the reasons I'm drawn to Eastern Europe. It's really fucking annoying in these parts, even if you just say something harmless like "I do think that there are differences between races", people act offended because oh my god you just used the word RACE when referring to HUMANS but THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS RACES WE ARE ALL HUMANS. My ex-girlfriend got into an argument with a leftist about that topic once, and instead of trying to argue with logic, he just went for being offended and calling her racist. And he even said: "If you study to be a teacher, I hope you fail your studies because someone like you should never be allowed in a school!" - "I'm not going to be a teacher, but thanks for wishing me to fail at my life for having an opinion."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meanwhile, saying things like "Thank you bomber Harris for destryoing Dresden in WW2, all those civilians were nazis so they deserved it LOL" is completely fine and not offensive at all. The self-hatred of German leftists is really off the charts. Meanwhile, Bulgarians openly fly their flags and are proud of smashing the Turks at Shipka. I'd rather be in a poor but healthy country where I can express my opinion more openly and can raise a family without having to fear corruption of my kids through leftist teachers.</p>

<p>I guess the one good thing of Eastern Europe having been socialist is that most people know that communism doesn't work correctly, and therefore the commies you get are more of the "we want powerful USSR back!" than the "lol communism lets me live as a degenerate slob who gets money for free" crowd we have over here.</p>

<p>Chalga music is the worst. The saddest thing is the artists are usually talented singers who have musical degrees but have to 'sing' that because otherwise they would live rather poor.</p>

<p>Although I am studying German I don't think I will ever move to DE. Or if that happens I'd choose something in East Germany where the most political incorrect people are. But I doubt that.</p>

<p>Sadly, leftists today have nothing to do with leftists then. I understand people back then when the workers were working in below miserable conditions etc but the modern degenerates who claim to be 'left' are so ammusing they would probably be imprisoned by the authentic left <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
