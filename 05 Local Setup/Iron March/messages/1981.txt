<p>Futurism can be thought of as the admiration of action. It is an aesthetic movement, meaning it focuses on imagery, sounds, symbols, etc. Anytime there is movement or activity, futurists see life and progress. The concept of something in a constant state of movement or change is very prevalent. Because of this, technology and the future are viewed in extremely high regards. The futurists despise stagnation or anything that is stuck in time or place. Because of this, futurists can be thought of as revolutionary and not reactionary. Most futurists wish to see traditional institutions destroyed and rebuilt as they have become decadent and have decayed, </p>
<p>Marinetti's Futurist Manifesto is the de facto piece regarding the aesthetic qualities of futurism. However, I am more of an audio person (studied music in school) so actually hearing some futurist composers is what made it click for me. Other's found it through architecture or visual media. It branched out into all aspects of art and become an all encompassing system, even going into the political sphere.</p>
