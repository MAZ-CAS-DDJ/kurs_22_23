<p>Could you elaborate a little more of what you mean by "secular Fascism" ? If you are asking about my religion, I am an atheist. However, I do recognize that there is a natural order/hierarchy to all things, including humanity. I just don't know if this order/hierarchy was created by a "deity" or not. I like to say that my faith/religion <strong>is </strong>Fascism. But, don't worry I am not one of those degenerate atheists types.  Also, yes the US is<strong> completely incompatible  </strong>with Fascism. As the US was founded on the <strong>false</strong> idea of democracy, which in turn is based on the completely false idea of equality. All of this is coming from an American by the way.
