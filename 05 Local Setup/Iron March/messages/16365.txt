	I can understand, it will take time to properly organize everything. Currently, I am only 17 years old but playing junior hockey in the ECHL. This will probably be my last couple of years of serious hockey unless I get on Westpoint's team. Just curious, have you done any intensive research into creating a paramilitary? You seem to have all the pieces falling into proper place, but of course we will need time for it all to connect together. I have confidence in this project, and I'm in love with the idea of our own battalion. Will we be only Polish-speaking or will we speak some English?
