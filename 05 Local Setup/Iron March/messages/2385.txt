<p>It is a shame that Americans such as those often make real Germans look bad. Don't even get me started on them Amis...</p>
<p>I find that your thoughts are rather similar to mine, unsurprisingly. But I was always taken aback by a Jew promoting National Socialism. Now I understand what you're aiming at, though. Are you in America? I forgot...</p>
<p>Wouldn't you be better off, anyways, using a different label for (y)our beliefs? Most people will, by default, think of the racialist, ethnically-confused Americans when seeing it. Or is it just something you use for this forum, where people are reasonably open minded?</p>
<p>As you can probably see, either way, I've still to completely make up my mind as far as my own accurate belief goes. If I had to pick a label I'd probably pick something like Prussian Socialist, or Meritocrat.</p>
