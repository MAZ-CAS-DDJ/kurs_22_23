	The government =/= the people.

	I said it before, our current government are a bunch of corrupt, spineless, cucked ex-commies.

	As for women, they are reactive. Where men go they will follow. If they think we find something attractive(i.e traditional garb) they'll wear it. In my country, right now, there's a surge of national pride, but not from the people in charge or the media, but from the common people. Hope it stays that way.

	As for the modern part, yeah, we are a shit hole. As far as infrastructure and quality of life we are way behind the west, hell even you guys are better then us. I'd rather visit Budapest then Bucharest(don't tell anyone i said this). Still, if this is the price we have to pay so we can keep being as we are, then i'm more then willing.
