<p>I bet there is a copy of that on libgen.org or mikrotheos.blogspot.com  Its ok but a lot of traditionalists were annoyed by it.  <br /><br />Anna Bramwell wrote several good books other than the Darre book on ecology, they're worth checking out.<br /><br />Libertarianism makes a lot of sense, I personally what has been termed 'pan secessionism' is the best idea for North America.  Libertarianism unfortunately really only offers environmentalists the option of lawsuits after damage has been done to the environment.  Natural entities or even landscapes themselves are only seen as material and have no autonomy or representation themselves.  Thats an essential tenet of Deep Ecology.   Arne Naess's collected works are on that libgen site also, the 'founder' of deep ecology.<br /><br />You should watch that documentary about kaczynski mentioned in the thread about him, there are some spoilers but its interesting.  I have to go again but I'll probably message you again later.<br /> </p>
