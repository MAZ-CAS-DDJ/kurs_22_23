<p>Sounds good! Okay so my first set of questions are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Short background on your relationship with GD (just so I can demonstrate you know what you're talking about in the essay, nothing incriminating or too revealing of course)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- How the GD uses social media to promote itself specifically in these contexts:</p>
<p>1. Spread propaganda and ideas to the population while bypassing ZOG owned media outlets</p>
<p>2. Organize events on the ground (e.g. demonstrations, direct action, food distribution etc)</p>
<p>3. Wether social media makes it easier or harder for GD to operate (what are some pros and cons GD faces when using social media)</p>
<p>4. The importance of English-Language online activism (e.g. Golden Dawn New york blog, BEWS's GD international news blog etc)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And also</p>
<p>- How the opposition uses mainstream and social media to counter GD</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you think any of the questions are "too probing" or detrimental in any way to GD please point it out and I'll make sure not to include anything related to that in essay or future questions. </p>
