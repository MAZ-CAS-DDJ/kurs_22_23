	Hey man sorry for late reply havent jumped on here in a while.Â <br />
	Yea the EYL in Brisbane is extremely small, I think our main Problem might just be population density or the religious tones of the group. Ive met a few good lads before who would be good Nationalists but just dont go for religion (yet)<br /><br />
	And yea Like I said If this is planned to be Similar to <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> then once my shit is sorted Ill definitely want to get involved.<br />
	My shit will hopefully be sorted by the Start of Next year
