<p>I was never formally diagnosed, I tend to mistrust so-called medical experts. I was told I may have it by a fellow BNPer whose stepson has Asperger's. I looked into it extensively and found that I almost certainly am autistic, I grow more convinced the more I hear. The psychologists do not understand it as well as those who are autistic, they  just base a diagnosis off of their own observations rather than anything to do with what Autism and such are like.</p>
<p>The best way to describe it is of every smell, sight, sound, light taste and such feeling as if it a part of you, there is no way to block it out, I also have particularly sensitive hearing. I tend to take what people say at face value and understand everything literally, apparently people communicate using their eyes or something but I do not understand it. I find that most things normal people do is odd and baffling, they seem to act out of motives I do not understand and they seem to have little appreciation for nature and wild places. That's the best I can describe it, other people mention me being enigmatic and of having insight into things others mostly don't notice.</p>
<p>I hope that helped. I would be skeptical of these so-called mental disorders, my understanding of Autism is that we are manifesting high levels of Neanderthal DNA but we are stuck with Sapiens sized heads and brains and thus certain parts of our brains are missing or malfunctioning. Almost certainly the more advanced of humanity are those manifesting traits that in the past would have been unnoticed or perhaps nurtured, but in the overly industrialised, anally bureaucratic and tyrannical societies we live in the more advanced being is likely to seem alien or malfunctioning from the dullard masses.</p>
