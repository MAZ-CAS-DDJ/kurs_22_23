<p>He also asked me of what i think about Slavros and Aristocrat.</p>
<p>So someone told you "oh that libertarian is actually sppd."?</p>

<p>Why he would be interested in Aristocrat specifically is strange, Slavros being an Admin it is more understandable. Also he was referred here by Loved I Not Honor More, but lives in Black America, most likely the South somewhere, so that's all quite strange.</p>
<p>Well, I was there when SSPD said he would do it, and well, he did. They put enough effort into trolling us sometimes that this is perfectly within their capabilities. Both "Falls the Shadow" and "Ms. Rand" were trolls, of SSPD and Torren respectively. Torren was apparently coached to post more like a girl. It's really not beyond their capability. SSPD spent some time concocting his Somalian paradise post, so it's not beyond his range to make a backstory.</p>
