<p>I believe that generally there still is a natural submissiveness.  I believe that is right.  Certainly, the wife should be submissive to the husband.  But, a general submissiveness of women to men?  I'm not so sure.  Ironically, women in the middle-class world are often more submissive in the U.S. than rougher working-class women. </p>
