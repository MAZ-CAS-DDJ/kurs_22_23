I'm not expecting Slavros to be happy about it, he'll probably miss the point and immediately declare victory again but I'm going to give him a harder time about it than I did last time if he does. The stubbornness and circlejerky herd mentality (not the same thing as unity in the positive sense) around here has got to go.</p>
