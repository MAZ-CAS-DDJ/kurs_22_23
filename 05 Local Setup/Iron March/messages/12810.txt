<p>Oh gosh, good luck! You'll do well, I'm sure. I've always been under the impression that Easter was just a moved and re-purposed equinox festival. Do they have different origins? And what do you think of Oswald?<br /><br />
Same. Whatever betrayal The Donald will commit is made worth it ten times over by the amount of liberal whining spewed in response to saying you like The Wall. Democracy's a joke- might as well laugh along. Gosh! You must be taking whatever the author of Revelation was, to see visions like that. 11 sounds like quite a late age to start, too. Do you think anything triggered it?<br /><br />
I've not seen the redwood forests, but giant trees are right up my alley, so I'd really like to. To be fair, wealth, regardless of area, often has that effect on people. But your neighbours sound lovely! Do you also hunt? This societal breakdown needs to end sharpish. I even know someone in the year below me at school with 'gender-neutral' pronouns.<br /><br />
Well your slogans would definitely do well for posters. What exactly do you do, in the movement? I've not even attended my first rally, but not for lack of wanting to. They're just all so far away at the moment and I can't take more than half a day off while studying for exams. Hopefully there'll be one in London soon and I can sneak off to that.<br /><br />
I think there's something about one's character that means they'll eventually turn fascist, some inborn admiration of those who wield absolute power well and disgust for the weakness of the masses, and after confronting that about myself, I began to look into ideologies that concentrated power and eventually had to admit that fascism was hands-down the best for this day and age. What do you think, and what made you fascist?<br /><br />
No problem- I hope ZOG is finding all of this very useful. I admire Unity's zeal, perseverance, beauty and charm, but she was also quite childish and rebellious, and in a suicide attempt which ended in her being sent home in disgrace, ruined her unique position among Hitler's in-group. She was in favour of an alliance between Britain and Germany, and could have been quite useful during the war, imo. Alas... Which German Hermann do you look up to, then, and why? The only German Hermann who springs to mind is GÃ¶ring.</p>
