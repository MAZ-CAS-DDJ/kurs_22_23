	Thanks! It would be wonderful, because the population growth in Poland is rather low. Currently it has risen a bit, because the government introduced a welfare program for young families (they can receive 500 zł for each child). The situation with fireamrs is the same. It's impossibly hard to get a gun permit. As for paramilitary, there is a option of joining Territorial Defense Forces or Riflemen's Association. Our Falanga members in Cracow are members of Riflemen's Association and some of them managed to join the regular army. In other towns we are also planning to join or organize similar groups, or at least attend shooting range regularly.
