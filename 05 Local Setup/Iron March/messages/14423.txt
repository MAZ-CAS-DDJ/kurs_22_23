	What I meant by that is: proportionality = good, toned = I don't care. Both seem to be the main things gymrat culture obsesses with. It's totally narcissistic and even homoerotic, and the latter is exactly the opposite of what you should be focused on if you either want actual strength or to attract women (we make fun of "Ken dolls"). The former is legitimately a good thing though; if you're going to be a narcissist, at least do it right. Disproportionate bodies look disgusting.<br /><br />
	Endurance and ability to hold your breath are great, very useful skills.
