<p>Eventually, yes, but we have the question of obtaining the initial manpower for anything. Jacob and Joe already have a handful of people in their community to work with.</p>
<p>Think of it like the scene from American History X, when Derek Vinland sends out a flag. We need to do the same thing. To get wide exposer, sure, we need a larger net- but we need to struggle to get the personnel to cast that net. If we only land a few more people to go along with this initially, it could help start building up. Quite frankly, we can't know how successful it'll be or how long it'd take until we try.</p>
