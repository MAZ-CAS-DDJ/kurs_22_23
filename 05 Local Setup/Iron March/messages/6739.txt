<p>You're aware that the SS was an extremely religious group, yes? In some divisions, it was require for the candidate to follow the Christian religion before he was even considered for officer status. Most SS men were devoted Christians, with the exception of Handschar division, which was predominantly Muslim. </p>

<p>So no, i don't think that's the case. In all honesty, i wouldn't be surprised if it were made up by Jews as a way to defame the SS. But if Lebensborn truly existed, i'd say it was merely a way for the German reich to produce more healthy children, as they knew SS men met the standards and most average men didn't. It probably wasn't their pride and glory, it would have more likely been something they kept a secret. </p>
