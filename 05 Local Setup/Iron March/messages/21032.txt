	The views of Esoteric Hitlerists vary depending on the religion of the EHs.
</p>

<p>
	The Hindu EHs believe Hitler to be Kalki (also known as the White Horse, the Destroyer of Filth, and the Harbinger of the End Time), the last avatar of Vishnu. He will end the Kali Yuga (Age of Kali, the fourth and last age) and bring us into an Aryan golden age.

<p>
	The Christian EHs believe Hitler to be God himself in human form, so a second Jesus.
</p>

<p>
	The Heathen EHs have differing views on this. Some believe him to be one of the Gods in human form, others believe him to be a demi-deity sent by one of the Gods.

	I, myself, am a Hindu EH.

	I know that Esoteric Hitlerism is true. There have been many great leaders in history, but Hitler stood out from them all. He was a simple man in a simple body, yet he always had a fiery and godlike look in his eyes. The way he spoke, the decisions he made, he could not have been natural. He couldn't have only been a genius. He had to be of a spiritual realm. Existing yet non-existing.

	"He who thinks national socialism is only a political movement does not understand anything." - Adolf Hitler
</p>

<p>
	"Hitler is a medicine man, a spiritual vessel, a demi-deity, or even better, a myth. He is the messiah of Germany who teaches the virtue of the sword. The voice he hears is that of the collective unconscious of his race." - Carl Jung
</p>

<p>
	"I love the Führer more than my husband. I would die for Hitler." - Magda Goebbels
