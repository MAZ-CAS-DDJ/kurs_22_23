<p>I've been looking at Esotericism for a while, and what you said in the "Law of Silence" thread clicked with me.<br /><br />"When I began studying this stuff, I eventually became aware of the dilemma of self-initiation: in the modern world, 99% of the study materials are corrupted, so you need to discriminate harshly to get the nuggets of gold among the chaff".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although I'm only forcing myself through Evola yet, what you said makes a lot of sense. I've ended up reading complete bullshit (Fake Gnosis and such) and have just ended up working in circles. Is there any decent materials you'd recommend? I'm not looking for some big guide, I'm aware I'll have to devote time to it myself, I'm just looking for a pointer in the right direction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
