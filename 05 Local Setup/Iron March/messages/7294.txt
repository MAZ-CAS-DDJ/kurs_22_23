<p>I don't feel like getting involved in the debate going on in that thread, but i wanted to let you know i admire the things you're saying there and i feel that i understand what you're trying to get at. I don't know if you recall the thread where Svit was saying stuff from Aryanism.net and you and i both criticised them (and him for agreeing with them) back then. But even before you posted the "Zion is our enemy" thread, i re-thought this criticism of Aryanism.net as well and had been reading their stuff more often. I found it ironic that around the time i started reading their website more, you posted that thread. Anyways, just figured i'd let you know that. </p>
