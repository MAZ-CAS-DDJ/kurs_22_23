<p>Any religion made in the modern era is truly not worth studying. Religions absorb the cultural values of the time period they come from, so what does it mean when a religion is born in the modern era of no values? Every religion invented in the modern era is a product of decadence and spiritual decay and should not be taken seriously, all forms of spiritual teaching nowadays are pretty vapid and corrupt. As was said in the Kali Yuga, in the ends of times the ancient scriptures shall be misinterpreted by fools who think they are sages. My mom is into that Eckhart Tolle shit, the spiritual wing of the cultural marxists. His whole philosophy is basically "dont solve your problems, just feeeeeel good, change your perspective, dont get angry about anything"</p>

<p>Christians say that Pagans are degenerate, Pagans say Christians are degenerate, the truth is both. Both religions have become steeped in filth and liberalism and must be cleansed before they can be of any use to the European man. The problem of modern degeneracy goes deeper than religion, it infects every fiber of our being. </p>

<p>Yeah, the downfall of Rome was pretty similiar to what appears to be happening to America and the West right now. Became too decadent, started selling our their land and work to barbarian mercenaries, started caring more about their gay sex wine orgies than they did about the empire, etc. There are many notes to take from history. </p>

<p>I think all ancient Europeans had stoic philosophies, the Romans and Greeks just refined it into a doctrine. Have you ever read the Jomviking saga? It's about a warband of Vikings that adventure and raid all the time; in their last battle they are defeated and captured and each one is executed the next morning. Before being beheaded each one is allowed to say is final words and the results are epically stoic. One of them stood up straight and faced the blade as it cut him because he didn't want to die like a cowardly sheep, another said "I will live forever with the Gods and in the songs of my sons, but you shall live in shame. On with it, cur!" </p>

<p>Our forefathers look upon modern Germanics with pity and disgust. A thousand years ago we would rather die than face dishonor. Now we cower and beg for the blacks and muslims to show us mercy. Pathetic. </p>
