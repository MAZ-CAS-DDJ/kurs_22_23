<p>Alright... Off-hand, I think I've tried to discuss with you before the topic of alliances and foreign policy, but I don't think it ever developed. Have you considered the potential for who would make the best ally for Russia, or what the form of such an alliance would require? Not to bolster your national ego, but Russia will likely be an important hinge player in the next generation or so, though I don't see the glory days of the Soviet Union being revived in your influence. Part of the problem we've had in America is not courting Russia enough, alongside not recognizing the emerging threat to our hegemony from China.</p>
