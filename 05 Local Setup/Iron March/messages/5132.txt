<p>Ok, so I assume you're going to be resitting this year?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What universities are there in that area? Nottingham, is good. But I'm unaware of what other places that offer degree study.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We currently don't have anyone from Lincoln, so someone going around agitating around there should be a boon to us. Ideologically we intend on being hardline and uncompromising when it comes to our propaganda - it is all out attack.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What we can do is send leaflets to you via courier, it is quite expensive, but if you are going to distribute them, it is worth the cost. What are you limits when it comes to activism? Are you able to travel or are restricted geographically? Do only do things as part of a group or can you do things alone? Staying legal is obviously important. </p>

<p>No, actually I'm taking a University course at the College rather than resitting my A-Levels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As far as any activity I could engage in, it would all be solitary. I don't have any sympathetic friends and Keith Thompson has informed me that the closest group I could find would be an hour's train ride away. Not that I'm fazed by that; I'd just need you to keep it in mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'd distribute anything you gave me and I could, say, make monthly trips to Nottingham if you don't already have someone up there. I don't have access to a car, though, so other than it would be restricted to Lincoln and North Hykeham.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What do you mean when you say limits? I, pretty much, up for anything as long as it's legal.</p>
