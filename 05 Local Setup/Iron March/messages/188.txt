<p>You do realise the Hebrew comment was a joke right?? You can't stop me posting, that's absurd! You told me to lighten up and I did, I even created a post explaining how I wanted to start over with Alex. Just tell me what you did that for?</p>
<p>I am off for about 3 weeks and this is about the only interesting thing I have to do, do you really want to ruin my Christmas? Haha! </p>
<p>Anyway, I thought we were on good terms? Aren't we?</p>
