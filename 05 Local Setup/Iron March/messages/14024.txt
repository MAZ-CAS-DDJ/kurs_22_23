	What do you mean by "to pure for this world"? But anyways, yeah I am really glad that I embraced Fascism. Unfortunately, it came after making two big mistakes in my life. The first was going full commie and being an outspoken one at that, and the second was joining the Freemasons. But, I outgrew the commie thing and left the Freemasons in order to become a Fascist. I still hold a lot of shame for my past mistakes, you think I should just let it go? I am also afraid that my fellow far-rights will condemn for my past mistakes. Should I worry about that? Or does the only thing that really matters is that I am here now? I still hope to become a far-right philosopher/academic so I can contribute to the worldview that I love. And once that happens, no one will doubt my loyalty or sincerity. Thoughts?
