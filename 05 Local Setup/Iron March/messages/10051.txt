<p>Alright, youre free to work with what I sent you if you want to. Thanks for the offer </p>

<p>You should research them a bit, they were much more advanced than what credit theyre given. They invented chainmail and the helmets adopted by the Romans and not to mention they constructed roads that bested the Romans. They controlled Spain and France and all the gold and fertility with it, yet curiously they were structurally and socially very primitive compared to Rome. That was their main downfall; even though they had better armor and swords on the same level as the Romans, Caesar had organization. </p>

<p>They were still pretty barbaric though, they practiced head-hunting for one </p>
