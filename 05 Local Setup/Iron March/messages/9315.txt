<p>Oh, that hit me. My hate calls my love to rise. Those are beautiful, powerful. You have a real talent. How long have you been writing? Who taught you?</p>
<p>Sad, yes, but inspiring. I look at these people so highly, they are my heroes. They are our teachers and our fathers and our saints, they have begun the long march and it is our time to fall into place. They begin to cut a path through the wild for us, so shall we for our children. There is no greater honor than to parttake in something mighty, that started before you were born amd will continue long after you are in the grave. We have big boots to fill... I look forward to the challenge.</p>
<p>And I'm glad to hear that... Even more glad to hear your response! Yes, my mother sounds like she shares the same talent of pulling one down... My father shows signs of agreement, we are alike in most every way, but I try to keep worrisome thins from his mind considering his health. What made today so good? <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>Lucky you asked... Italian fascists make the BEST music, Torquemada introduced me. I love sk√∂ll, Bronson, zeta zero Alfa, 270 bis...</p>
<p>Watch this one... She is so beautiful it makes me stupid xD</p>
