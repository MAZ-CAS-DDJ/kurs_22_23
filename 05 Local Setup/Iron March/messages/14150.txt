	I wouldn't go as far as to try and remove your account, but it's understandable wanting to stay away from games. They're a huge timesink. There's no harm in having a bit of downtime here and there, just don't make it a daily or an all day thing. Gotta blow off some steam somehow. I've stopped playing games almost entirely since some point last year. Maybe do it 2 hours a week average. Something like that.
