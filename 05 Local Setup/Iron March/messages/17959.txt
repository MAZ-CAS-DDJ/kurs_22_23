	Good to hear you're making strides towards Total Aryan Victory. We've been building a group ourselves for a while, it's a youth organisation so unfortunately our cut off age is 30.

	What is the direction and plan for your club, what is it you wish to achieve wit it?

<p>
	We'd also be more than willing to help out if you ever need it and collaborate with you guys in the future.
