<p>The meet up is more of a fun tiemz trip, several users including myself are going to the metal festival in the Czech republic, Brutal Assault, in August - you can find a dedicated topic to it in the Music subforum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ideally the trip will then move us to Finland to meet up with a finnish user and then the lot of us who will manage to get together will go to Moscow where I'll act as host and guide. So far the total group is expected to be max 5 people, min 3.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>if you're interested in joining us at any point in this trip or would like to participate in the entire trip you're obviously more than welcome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking forward to your topics, Centurion Method has only been discussed in its earlier manifestation and in passing but I assume you saw the bits of that in the Fitness topic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks, I am still deep in research and even what was already posted demands some expansion on, I'm currently reading the Hermetic Tradition and have 5 other Evola books after that. There's also Francis P. Yockey's Imperium, Myth of the XXth century and some other materials that I will go through before I can assemble a comprehensive vision of our worldview. It is far too early to consider publishers, however one of our american users, having gotten to know my work on the book, has pledged to sponsor its publishing in the US. Once it is complete I'll gladly accept any help in spreading it.</p>

<p>Ha, getting Jack Donovan to commit to using the word Fascist these days is hard. He was really into the whole Ur-Fascism thing for a long time and he still talks about his anarcho-fascistic stance and definitely still holds that dream of the future, but I don't know, I think he's going down the organic farming and building shacks in the woods with dudes wearing fur route at the moment.</p>

<p>Well that is rather sad to hear. Actually his "anarcho-fascism" article came around the same time I experimented with a narrative on how fascists would actually thrive in anarchy as a setting, as a result, between my research and having read his book and some articles I had come up with what I considered to be the only valid manifestation of Fascism in the United States, I organized a workshop around it with some yank users but it is now publicly available - <a data-ipb="nomediaparse" href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/3805-american-futurism-workshop/" rel="">American Futurism</a>. I was planning to contact him at some point in order to present this concept to him as I thought it was exactly where he was going but with the additional background and "what comes after" explanations based on my own research.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But now it sounds like he is regressing so that is an unfortunate development.</p>
