<p>While there's more legal hurdles to fascism in Britain the repression in the states is a lot more subtle and effective. It wouldn't surprise me if you got more resistance from Conservative people than liberal, considering how much of a love affair conservatives have with Israel and the Jews. I have a saying by Mussolini and a symbol of the Fasces on a bumper siticker on my car, so the topic comes up on occasions. I find that once you get past the Jews people can be sympathetic, but it's a huge hurdle to get past.</p>
