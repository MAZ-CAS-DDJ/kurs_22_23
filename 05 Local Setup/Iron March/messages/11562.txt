<p>I'm trying to remain as anonymous as possible because being connected to this site would prevent me from doing the things I want to, if that makes sense. I have aspirations, but, yes, I agree that worldview is more important if it comes down to it.</p>

<p>I already know of Atomwaffen and I'd join if the above was the only issue, but my situation is a bit complicated. Moreso than just "I'm picking a college". It'll be about half a year before I could participate in anything, and I don't know where in the US I will be yet.</p>

<p>It's hard to explain all this without just telling you my life story, but I would still like to join Atomwaffen when I have to oppertunity to do so. I probably won't be in your area but I understand you guys operate elsewhere as well, so, if you'd like, I can update you when I know where I'm going, and then when I am there.</p>

<p>Hope I don't come across as an FBI informant, but, I promise, I'm not just trying to blow you off.</p>
