<p>Yeah, I still hope that Paganism has a future...but if it does, it isn't right now. Perhaps after the wars to come we can start the process of rebuildling, but to rebuild Paganism in the age of Kali Yuga will do nothing but defile it. That's why most neopagans are such degenerates, it's less paganism itself and more the time period that it's being revived in ("and lo, fools shall be praised as sages and sages as fools, while the ancient scriptures shall be misinterpreted by fools who believe they are sages")</p>
<p>Until then I will serve the gods better through blood and honor than anything else </p>
<p>I'm still going to make efforts for Paganism, like the book project I'm working on, but my spiritual life gets pretty lonely. I learn more about Paganism every day through intense study but nobody else seems to care. I know that I'm not supposed to be concerned with others on that matter but it feels like all the mysteries I've unlocked will die with me, nobody would buy any books I wrote on it or anything</p>
