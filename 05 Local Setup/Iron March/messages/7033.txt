<p>Yeah, the 90s were great. Fuck the modern kinds and fuck previous generations - especially baby boomers and those hippy generations. I was in a school where there were a lot of Bosnian and Serbian kids from some notorious neighbourhood, me and some other classmates were good friends with one Bosnian kid who'd later become some sort of mobster, he went to jail at 18. I remember how we did all kinds of problems together. My best friend was Serbian and he had good relationship with some feared Serbian guy just becuase their fathers were friends. In our school you basically learnt how the world works and how everyone connects along the ethnic lines, only the local (indigenous) people don't, just like it is in the world of adults. You also learnt not to rat and to stand up. Today they probably teach kids in school to be faggots and snitches. Remember that these kids today probably never get beaten by their parents either.</p>

<p>Our childhood revolved around playing football and hanging around the neighbourhood and doing stupid shit. As far as TV and video games were concerned, as you said, pretty much it had to involve football, racing, fighting or shooting to be cool. This was the way 90% of the boys were and it was just taken for granted. I remember when the movie Gladiator came out in 2000, went to see it in cinema twice and then watched it like million times on video tape. That was one great movie promoting heroic masculine values of our Roman (ie. Western) ancestors, everyone in my generation loved it. Notice how they don't make movies like Gladiator, Ben Hur or El Cid anymore, the only relatively recent exception being 300. Everything else is just fantasy stuff like LOTR or pathetic attempts to depict politically correct version of our history, like that movie where Alexander the Great was some sort of faggot or that recent movie Pompeii promoting some sort of "Roman guilt".</p>

<p>I was just thinking about this when I was going home from our pub. I had few beers with my crew and Gladiator was on TV. Will watch this movie at home tomorrow for nostalgic reasons. If Hollywood can make such a good movie which basically promotes our values, imagine what we would be doing if we were in charge of society with all the modern technology and resources available to us. There would be tons of such movies and similar propaganda made to inspire the youth to live healthy lives and have positive values.</p>

<p>Personally, I mostly hang out only with people I know from hooligan and NS scene. I'm also on good terms with many people it's just that it's boring to hang out with them most of the time. It's always fun with fascist people around, can't beat fascist humour.</p>
