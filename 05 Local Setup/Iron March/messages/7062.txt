<p>Italians always had good sense for fascist aesthetics, their fascist slogans, songs and fashion have always been top shit. They also have a sense for tactics and strategy (this is also visible in the criminal world, mafia is so strong because of its sheer size and connections), so they basically came out as winners in both world wars even though they were horrible on the battlefield, but they betrayed their alliances on both occasions. In WW1 we (Austria-Hungary) fought them in one of the toughest battlefields in history (Italian/Isonzo Front <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Mg2hQbkHkNs/TDJMUGUiNOI/AAAAAAAAAco/maSRQgIV8TY/s1600/scott_midge+1.JPG" rel="external nofollow">right in the Alps</a>) - it was their only front and A-H was on the brink of collapse, but we were winning left and right. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Caporetto" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Caporetto</a> Only Sardinians were really tough, others were just shitty soldiers. Italy basically achieved unification only after clever manipulation by people like Cavour and changing sides all the time. Spanish are the only Romance nation which have produced tough warriors. I always enjoyed stories about conquistadors and Spanish volunteers on the eastern front were amazing.</p>

<p>Fascism indeed produced tough soldier. Even here the Home Guard units I was talking you about, they were basically reactionary Catholic anti-Bolshevik unit collaborating with the Nazis, average age was like 20, compared to much older partisans. Yet they never lost a battle during the war after they got some basic training and reconquered almost entire territory in south Carniola. Local partisans (in Slovenia) had around 24.000 losses in their fight against Germans and Home Guards, compared to 6.000 losses these two had together at most. They were hiding in the forrest waiting for Soviet Union to win and then massacred all 14.000 unarmed Home Guards who were handed to them by the British after the war. That's the victory commies still celebrate here... After the victory they (Yugoslav commies) betrayed Stalin in 1948 and basically became American allies, got some good loans which sustained the horrible economics of Yugoslavia until Tito's death. After the fall of the Berlin wall the commie "elites" simply abandoned the sinking ship and embraced capitalism and collapse of Yugoslavia. Communism lost without a single shot fired, NO ONE was defending it. Compare that to 16 year olds defending the 3rd Reich to death.</p>

<p>In our case here in Slovenia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_Home_Guard" rel="external nofollow">Home Guards</a> never signed any sort of peace treaty, so we like to keep this mythology of fight against modernity which never ended alive. Thousands of our brothers in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_graves_in_Slovenia" rel="external nofollow">mass graves all over the country</a>, it was a worthy sacrifice and it kept our ideology alive. There are also millions of personal stories about red terror, some of them are really sad, I heard a story of a mother who lost all her 4 sons to red terror, one of them sadistically killed just because he belonged to some Catholic movement before the war and she couldn't even talk about it to anyone for 45 years. If you go to some parts of our countryside people simply don't want to hear anything about communism or the left, they'll associate everyone slighly left with the "reds", it's a good thing. Those villages which had a lot of anti-communist soldiers were deliberately neglected by the regime which wouldn't even build normal roads there. The story of our local German minority is also tragical. You see, that's the problem in Western Europe, your local left gets away with playing the victim and all the moralizing because they never had a real chance to commit such crimes. Here they moralized about "fascist crimes" and proved to be much worse, against their own people, so you can't take it seriously and honest people aren't fooled by it. The only problem here is that regular right is naive and tries to adopt leftist-like victimism, but they don't understand that EU/West simply don't care about White Christian "victims of history". It's different with us fascists, we have "viva la muerte" mentality and won't play this crying game, it just makes us stronger and colder. No mercy for marxists and other untermensch degenerates of all sorts, just like they didn't have a shred of mercy for our people. I'm perfectly honest here, when I heard about what Breivik did, he became a hero to me. The biggest European hero of 21st century so far, I don't care what those soft moderate WN fuckers think. The left will never have anyone like him</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As I said before, had they lost liberalism and marxism would always had that "it could have been a paradise of freedom" aura around them, now they're dicredited.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'll translate some of our local stories of red terror, they need to be heard. This is all part of our common European history, it could have happened to any nation and leftists from every country would turn to untermensch animals if they were given a chance, many fascists from the West don't realize this and become too soft towards them.</p>

<p>Some posters of Home Guard and a great video: <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/243-posters-central/page-11#entry81363" rel="">http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/topic/243-posters-central/page-11#entry81363</a> We're proud of them because that's the only legacy that's related to fascism our country has and we'll try to build on that in the future.</p>
