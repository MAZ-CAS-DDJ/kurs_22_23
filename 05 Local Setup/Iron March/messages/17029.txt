	good luck getting out mate

	that's the thing with cities

	you move in for the jobs, then it's so expensive to get out of the area that you can't leave + quit your job because you'll be left with even less than you started

	some shitty apartments in downtown atlanta were 350k/mo

	ikea has some pretty nice stuff tbh, i think its actually all just european stuff in general and marketed as swedish? we got a french press, coffee to go with it, plates and bowls, and some stuffed animals for the kids. i went though because my mother wanted me to go with her

	though srsly m8, we looked at a house near where i live now.  four acres, three bedroom two bath , out of town for 80 grand. cheap and rural life, it's great even though you'll probably make less money since theres not a whole lot of industry here.
