<p>No, past sites I have worked on have been taken down and I haven't saved images of them (I don't know why anyone would save images of sites they made).</p>
<p>So, who is the person you are currently working with? Perhaps I could collaborate with them and help them out and additionally help the site. Also, if that's what you are planning you could probably just use a CMS. Not sure if you know what that is but it's like a portal/hub page, you would have tabs and links, etc. which could easily link to a forum and blog. Like I said, using pre-made software for something like this would be easier than hand-writing it, or you would be hiring a team of developers to make custom software. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>Also can you link me to the site? I might be able to plan based on what is already there.</p>
