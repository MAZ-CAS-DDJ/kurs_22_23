<p>I tend to see the russian case as more ``proper``. They have the Tartarstan inside of Russia. My choice of words wasn`t really appropriate Â haha. And Spanish and Portuguese always get mixed, so I know the feel of ''serbo-croatian'', almost like you are the same people. Yugoslavia is interesting because it held so many people ''together'', but I can understand the negative effects (kosovo). I don't know if you understood me, but I get what you mean, thanks for the help.</p>
