	Yeah, my personal skype account is different from my ironmarch one, so that's a good call there. It's unfortunate that the music world is so heavily dependant on personal connections; I have to watch what I say in public and not "out" myself entirely .... at least not yet. I hope that one day when my income and career is firmly established, I can speak out as openly as I want to on the issues that matter, like Wagner did or what Varg Vikernes does now (Varg is a black metal musician from Norway who's awesome and runs his own blog/youtube channel where he talks about traditionalism and about pagan philosophy). By the way, what would you consider your religious beliefs to be?
