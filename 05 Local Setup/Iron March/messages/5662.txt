<p>i am part greek, though mostly Scottish and German. i have just always had a close relationship with the Greek part of my heritage, and i feel closely connected to the gods of ancient Greece.</p>
<p>back to oregon, the town i live in, tri-city (its in douglas county, one of the larger counties in the state) in is more than 90% white, though recently theres been a small increase in the hispanic population, nothing much, just a family or 2</p>

<p>Hi, Goliath;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sorry it took so long to respond, but I've been very busy at work and, then, for the holidays.  I hope you had a nice Thanksgiving.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I can understand feeling closer to one part of your heritage.  I respect all parts of my ancestry, but feel closer to my German roots.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Is Oregon liberal to the point where it dominates state politics, or is it mostly confined to certain areas?  Californian non-liberals are so outnumbered that we're effectively powerless against our Marxist government.</p>
