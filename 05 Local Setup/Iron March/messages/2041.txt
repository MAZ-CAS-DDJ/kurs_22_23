You grandfathers die in wars to ensure you living space and now some ugly coon came and bread your air ??

<p>If only we had nationalists were as good as the nationalists of Europe and of Russia (reactions of the nationalists after the crime upon Yegor  Svidirov, R.I.P.) maybe the yanks could've shutted their asses up.</p>
