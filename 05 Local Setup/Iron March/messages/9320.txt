<p>Is their a particular reason why you can't stay/don't want to stay? If you'd rather keep it privite thats fine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've spent a lot of the past few years sacrificing my own time for the sake of my family, which cost me a lot of opprotunities and im honestly done with it. Not family, but being the guy everyone can always count on to be there to help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Partially because it's often taken for granted and unappreciated, but also because i need to get my own life going, i've waited to long already. My Father is not in the poor health yours is but he does have his problems, but he often tells me not to worry about him and do what i think i need to do. And while i still worry for him at times, especially about financial matters, I feel like the only way i can be of help to my family in the longrun is to Improve my own situation first.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I can definately understand the overwhelming desire to just get out and find greener pastures though.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I can't speak for him but i imagine your Father could feel the same, and not wish to feel like he's a burden on you or stopping you from makeing the most out of you life.</p>
