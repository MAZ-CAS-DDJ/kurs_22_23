<p>I managed to squeeze Ezra Pound, Breivik, Golden Dawn, Rockwell etc into my paper. So I had lots of fun walking the line. I'm sure the professor walked away with a a slightly different take on things.</p>

<p>I think he might've been Jewish(his name was German, but it's a very common Jewish surname), but now I'm doubting that. He's a history buff and said he really liked 1930s Europe.
