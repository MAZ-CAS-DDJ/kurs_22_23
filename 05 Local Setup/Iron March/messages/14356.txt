	I will screen them for you but it might be an idea if you set up a separate email just for Atmomwaffen enquiries. We use Tutanota (encrypted email – between Tutanota accounts only.) Each region has its own, e.g. <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> North West, <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> London, <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> South Wales, etc… and then most all of our activists have a personal one for internal <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> communication.

	Stickercaust isn’t a bad tactic. But what’s the objective beyond causing fear? Is there a long-term strategy?

	I’ll carry on speaking to you for the time being mate. I can always open communications with Odin as well at a later date.
