<p>Hello, I'd have a few questions if you don't mind.</p>
<p>Are you a supporter of Serbian Action and aren't they the Serbian equivalent of Noua Dreapta, Forza Nuevo et cetera?</p>
<p>Also, what's your opinion on Obraz and are there similar organizations that emerged after it was made illegal?</p>
<p>Finally, what do you think of Serbian organizations such as the Ultra-Chetniks?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time,</p>
