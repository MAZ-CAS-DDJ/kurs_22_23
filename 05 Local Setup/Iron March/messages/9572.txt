<p>The fat one in the picture with me is Kai, he is my favorite &lt;3 he loves when I sing to him.</p>
<p>It really is idyllic. It gives me hope. When I first started that job, I was the primary caretaker for my father. I spent hours a day spoon feeding him smoothies, he would choke on every bite. He was so depressed and he could barely walk. It felt like I was surrounded by death. So the job really saved me. It gave a balance to be around new and healthy life.</p>
<p>It's beautiful. Reminds me of a song, Non Scordo by 270 bis.</p>
