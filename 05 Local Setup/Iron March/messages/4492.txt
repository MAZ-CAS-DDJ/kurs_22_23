<p>Dont let your age sell you short. The youth need to have an eye for tomorow. Im not that old myself.</p>
<p>However I think, if you will excuse the expresion, bury the hatchet with your fellow east asians. One think I ponderd a time ago is that China is loking for a rout to send its warships to the open seas without crossing someone else's waters. This has caused disputes with all the nations around the south China sea. If Japan gets out from under Uncle Sam's Jackboot Japan could open up a corridor for chinese ships to pass through with economic concessions from China for a set amount of time. But also stipulate that no nuclear weapons could pass through said corridor. So its a win for Japan, a win for China and contains atomic weapons globaly.</p>
