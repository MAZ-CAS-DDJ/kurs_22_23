<p>It's mostly because I believe our culture and population are predominately South Italian, even though our language has many Semitic aspects, due to our long history with each other (the only reason we did not become a part of Italy during the risorgimento was because of the British takeover)  and that it would mostly benefit us in the long run (both economically and it would put an end to the "identity crises" we have been having since independence). I'm not fanatical about it though; I'm willing to remain independent of Italy until the problems with their government and the South are sorted out. </p>
<p>Nowadays there are very few who think this way (I'd say less than 3% of the population). The notion had a very strong support from the end of the 19th Century until the 1940's, but it died down with the war.</p>
