<p>Some other miscellaneous things:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- You really do want to spend your first year in/near Seoul. If you come we can hang out and I can introduce you to some people that might be useful to get you into the social circle you want to be in. There are two very far right Korean skins who speak fluent English, BTW.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- If you see a higher paying job near Seoul, the priority for you would be something like </p>
<p>(1) Ilsan (you can still catch cabs back and forth to Seoul at the most reasonable price, same with buses)</p>
<p>(2) Uijeongbu (only about an hour away from central seoul by subway)</p>
<p>(3) Bupyeong (Same as Uijeongbu, but its a bit seedier and less known subway for me)</p>
<p>(4) Ansan (about 1.5 hours away from central Seoul)</p>
<p>(5) Suwon (the longest trip but it is still not terrible).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- The first year it might be not the best job. It is much easier to get good jobs once you are in Korea because you are more networked and are 'on the ground' so to speak. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Public teaching gigs aren't terrible because you are more likely to do a 9-5 type thing. In fact, it might be really smart to pursue that your first run. However, the availability vares wildly, I think. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>- There is some cultural baggage to put up with. Just nod your head and play along with most of it. You'll get a good grasp on it eventualy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I knew a guy who came and his first 2 weeks here were so miserable in adjusting that he thought about leaving right away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I talked him down... He got used to it. Stayed for 4 years. Learned Korean. Got a job at Samsung making nearly $100,000 grand a year, and then he is coming back now to get his Ph.D. and pursue something better. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keep that in mind if you arrive and have a rough entry. </p>
