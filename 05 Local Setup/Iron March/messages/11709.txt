<p>Well for now I'm the only Serb who has spare time to write and research stuff on this forum, and I would like to bust a myth of serbo-communists with some articles.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask for the Legacy section, what format of text if acceptable? I read one with d'annunzio and it's basically his one adventure, something I can not do for people like Dimitrije LjotiÄ‡. I found a great text I could translate and submit, about Dimitrije and his struggle from begining till end. I was wondering if this could be turned into several-parts series(since it's kinda huge), each one dealing with specific major event including his strict biography, like the formation of ZBOR, banning of the same, 27th march coup, froming combat units etc. If it can, that would be good amount of content, the only downside maybe, is that it would follow one man and his movement.</p>
