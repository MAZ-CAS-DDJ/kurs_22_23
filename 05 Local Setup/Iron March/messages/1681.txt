Specifically developing a working healthcare model and radical response to obesity (assuming the US food supply is untouched.. I am somewhat pessimistic about the stability of the economy beyond simply whether it is going to be in a major downturn - it clearly is already). I don't think fat taxes are going to be anywhere near as comprehensive enough of an approach and it is truly a massive problem for the west. Policies I was thinking of as possible solutions include reversing PE cuts in the public school system, creation of outdoor gyms, incentives for gym membership and/or exercise under a single payer plan, zoning laws for "fast food," bans on sodas in schools, major changes to the farm subsidies and food stamp and school lunch programs.</div></blockquote>
<p>Healthcare- Establish Health Savings Accounts to pay for routine procedures directly, cap the number of doctors to be licensed, restrict the rate at which new technologies can be introduced into the market(maximizing economies of scale), reduce the length of time a patent exists, and subsidize multiple patient wards.</p>
<p>Obesity- Shift subsidies from grains and legumes to vegetables, subsidize offal, require <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyculture" rel="external nofollow">polyculture</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyface_Farm" rel="external nofollow">the Salatin method</a> as requirements for recieving substities; outlaw certain industrial processing practices, such ammonization of "meat by-products", the addition of HFCS or Soybean oil, or the use of any non-natural preservative; subsidize gym memberships, or provide corporate exemptions for assisting employees in gym memberships; mandatory athletics in place of PE in schools. I suppose allowing companies to discriminate against clients by health indicators rather than on pre-existing conditions would be reasonable as well; higher body-fat percentages would pay more than lower ones, and higher cholestoral <em>ratios</em>(compared to overall numbers) increasing costs as well. We already charge more for smokers, so why should other indicators of health, such as BFP, or high LDL-HDL levels, or Trigleceride to HDL, or high sugar, be tolerated more?</p>
<p>Also, I kept "fat" in quotations, because I wouldn't actually tax fat. I'd tax gluten, soy, and sugar content. Fat consumption is good for you, depending on the source. However, the fat tax should be considered if the afforementioned methods don't work.</p>

<p>I disagree; increases in fossil fuel costs are inevitable, so placing an advantage on other sources of energy and transport, alongside funding for them, not only improves our long-term growth, but would immediately increase GDP as massive investment into green technologies and transport went underway. It would also encourage energy effeciency where fossil fuels are still required, which would require reinvestment into those processes, as well as reducing overall oil consumption while maintaining or expanding growth.</p>
<p>However, it'd be part of a two-part, carrot/stick process. It could have those effects if companies <em>can't</em> adapt, but then again, replacing the income tax reduces the cost of labor, which should provide companies with the excess capital to reinvest in more sustainable processes. Government grants wouldn't hurt, either.</p>
