<p>I'm not that familiar with socialist realism to be honest.  My training in art history has always had focus on Western European traditions.  I'm more familiar with constructivism, than socialist realism. From the few examples I have seen of socialist realism, it doesn't seem to diverge that greatly in style and subject matter from American impressionism like John Sloan or George Bellows, which was obviously influenced by French artists like Manet and Corbert.</p>
