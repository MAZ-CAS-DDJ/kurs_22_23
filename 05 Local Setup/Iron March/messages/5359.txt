<p>So I had a couple of questions. First, do you have skype? Second, how do you feel about futurism?</p>
<p>I liked your blog on Charles Ciroan (I think that was you). Thanks for the time!</p>

<p>I do not Skype, though I ought to. Why do you ask?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I did no blog on Ciroan, but I know the guy who did.</p>
