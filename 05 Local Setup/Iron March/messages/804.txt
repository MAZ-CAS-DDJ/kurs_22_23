<p>Done. Obviously this was for the faithful but it is of course a matter of time before the Antifa start using this place as a honey trap so if you can avoid the drama that is the best.</p>
<p>A word on the forum; I mistook a few scandinavian sounding names here for people that might be useful to you, but despite that there are always oppurtunities. There is a Ukrainian ultranationalist internet radio group for instance we will be doing shows for. I have also found the forum useful for recruiting and obtaining various personalities so contibuting to it's general life is an investment that pays off.</p>
<p>It is suprising that with the exception of the occassional adventurer most people are are generally consistant in their attitude. Even the Russians here will attest to the fact they what they want is imperialism by force rather than professing some sacred right or benevolance. We therefore almost never have the stupid fights you see in the latvia topic, and even that is more the russians failing to come to terms with the 90's rather than a sense of entitlement. nobody needs to go behind anyones back because we are all fundamentally in agreement when it comes to logic.</p>
<p>Relevant article here; Russia's southern flank, that sent the general staff into a panic. They won't pull anything like that again for another 12 years at least. </p>

<p>Thousands of journals with the odd free article, so a decent academic resource. I have been looking for alot of counter insurgency material and it has been useful for that.</p>
