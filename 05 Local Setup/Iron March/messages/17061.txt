	Ye, I know about DugoviÄ‡ :) Sadly average serbs prolly doesn't know about him.<br /><br />
	Everything that happened after april war was out of control. Italy before the war had no claims on Yugoslavia and Fascist wanted to have peace with Yugoslavia. They had no choice but to give kosovo to Albania and expand their protectorate, it's a logical move on their part. Everyone did that except Romania. Antonescu refused to annex parts of Yugoslavia. If I remember correctly Hungarian prime-minister commited suicide when Hungary invaded.
