	Hopefully things will get better. I was supposed to go to Poland this summer but my plans got changed. I talked to another Falanga member on here and we were going to plan to meet up but that must be postponed now. Do you have any Falanga members in the US? I've been interested in spreading the word to other Poles here in the United States. I back you guys 100%. Falanga must be the future of Poland.
