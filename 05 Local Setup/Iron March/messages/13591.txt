	1. I had worked with Alex for years and helped him found the group, though I started off mainly in tech support/graphics

	2. Very tough question - it differs country by country and the outcomes can be very different. Mid term it is going to be good in eastern europe, all the governments are going to be openly nationalist and anti immigration, some like Latvia and Ukraine will have fascists in government. Western/northern europe hang on a knife edge - I see a massive conflict long term and the security services intervening, I don't see terrorism and shit as controllable.

	3. So far they have only committed to 35000 over a 5 year period which compared to germany is nothing. We already have too many kebabs.
