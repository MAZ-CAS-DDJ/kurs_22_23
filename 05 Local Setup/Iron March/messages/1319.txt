<p>I do, I am also a fan of Mass Effect, though I have not yet played the third game, I also enjoy Alan Wake, though it is more surreal if anything.</p>
<p>I would say True Blood is a well produced piece of escapism set in a close-knit town where virtually all the young people are fairly good looking. It's a bit gory sometimes but I am drawn in by the complexity of the characters.</p>
<p>The Nazi stuff wasn't significant, nor did they feel the need to slander the reich. One of the vampire characters sided with the third reich (using werewolves) for his own ends. It was only mentioned for a small part of one episode.</p>
<p>Plus you get to see Anna Paquin's tits on several occasions along with plenty of nuddiness featuring several female actresses. You see the odd man's bottom too but the amount of lovely girl's bottoms makes up for it several times over.</p>
<p>I'm fine with the messages, I do not use MSN at all any more.</p>
