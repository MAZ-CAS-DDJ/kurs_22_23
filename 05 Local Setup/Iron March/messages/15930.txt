	Greetings, sorry for the late response but I've received your message. I should note that I don't have a camera at this present time and therefore don't have a skype id. Tbqh as someone who lives on Staten Island I'm not sure how attending your group located in Rochester would work out. I'm sorry but I may have to decline your offer simply due to the location of your group. Please respond when you get a chance as perhaps we may discuss working something out.
