<p>This "world elite" nonsense you're espousing to me reeks of nothing but teenage conspiracy tripe; I am aware indeed that there exist a Capitalist "elite" presiding over a global economy, and presiding over global market but I am not so sure they have the level of control that you believe they do; for that matter - I am not sure that these 'population measures'(even if were being really enacted) truly matter.</p>
<p>I'm not concerned with "minorities" being dwindled down; they can overpopulate their own continents if they wish - I just do not want them in my own. I do not believe it is an 'archaic and outdated' belief, merely that it is complying to the law of nature. Nature is typified by inequality and creating social laws and social programs cannot combat the rule of nature; nature will always overcome that which is fighting what is natural and what is natural to us at least is inequality. We thus do not worry about overpopulation as a whole because we believe nature will sort the weak out from the strong regardless, as it always has - through catastrophe.</p>
<p>We base this on science; trust me - I am no religious man. I am an Atheist. If what is going on now will hurt us both, then I suggest you stop worrying about killing us, because for one I'm going to tell you we're not very afraid; we are very aggressively-minded men and are willing to do all and anything to secure our peoples, and also because of everything you just said. Mussolini &amp; Hitler knew quite well that sometimes Communists must be worked with, hence why Mussolini always wore a pennant of Marx on his uniform and why Hitler worked the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact into affect; we know, sometimes, both our interests collide.</p>
