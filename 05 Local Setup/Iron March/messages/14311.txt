	Probably so. I hate seeing working class white kids competing against 40 year old mexicans for jobs. My man is a landscaper and he's the only white guy on the crew, at least the rest are seasonal workers who go back to mexico. That i can respect. But yeah, every job I've worked is looking less and less white lately. You ever see a homeless mexican? I haven't in years.
