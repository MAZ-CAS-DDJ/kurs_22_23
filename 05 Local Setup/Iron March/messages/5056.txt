<p>I would prefer to begin from Ethiopia for a few reasons.</p>
<p>1. It is roughly the area from which homo sapiens first aooeared</p>
<p>2. Nubia, one of the few ancient black civilizations, was located around Ethiopia.</p>
<p>3. Ethiopia has always had a strong, respectable culture, compared to the rest of Africa. They actually stopped Italy from invading, plus they trolled the West by claiming to have the ark of the covenant.</p>
<p>And also, read my intro thread because I admitted I was trolling, lol. I just want to participate in fascist discussions, and I was high when I wrote the whole black thing. I'm actually white, I am just very interested in radical political views, and I enjoy studying and participating in discussions. I was going to just stay in character as a black fascist, but then I just got tired of it. So I've made a few other posts so far.</p>
<p>As for my political views? I say humanity is fucked regardless because of our savage animal-like fetish for sex and violence. Therefore, any form of civilization we create will subconsciously express our collective need for sex and violence. And that is where decadence comes from. Therefore, I have no faith in any political system. I'm more or a nihilist who enjoys nothing more than drinking beer, making money, and posting on political forums. Honest to god. </p>
<p>But my Ethiopia plan is what I would put into place coming from the perspective of a black fascist attempting to reclaim sub Saharan Africa.</p>
</div></blockquote>Ah, I see then.
