<p>My reasons for not posting here are rooted in personal reasons. I really detest the majority of users here, especially the administration. On top of that, I find I make a lot of philosophical and ideological concessions in the name of civility and community. Most of what I've said in the past doesn't really reflect accurately my beliefs, partially due to them constantly evolving, but mainly due to pressures from external variables within the forum. </p>
<p>There aren't any other forums I particularly post on, however. I keep in touch with one user from the forum, Elegos, who is the most well versed individuals and one of the only true fascists here. I'd recommend getting in touch with him if you have questions on economics as he is much more knowledgeable in that area than I. I tend towards philosophy more than tangible political aspects.</p>
