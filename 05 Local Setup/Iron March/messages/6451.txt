<p>"Truthfully, in this age those with intellect have no courage and those with some modicum of physical courage have no intellect. If things are to alter during the next fifty years then we must re-embrace Byron's ideal: the cultured thug." - Johnathan Bowden</p>

<p>In many respects the conventional Left, having become the establishment, has rendered itself 'conservative' and therefore inherently unappealing to young people. Naturally, the majority of modern European populations are short-sighted, incapable of stepping outside of their own lives and fundamentally apolitical. However, that pool from which all radicals, fanatics and political animals are drawn is now orienting itself towards inegalitarian philosophies. There's an emotional appeal to that which is branded as being somewhat demonic and unpredictable. This is why, more than half a century after the collapse of the Third Reich, National Socialism still fascinates so many people from all over the political spectrum. Ultimately, the day of the left-wing, fist-pumping student is over. But the energy these cretinous students once made use of is still there, and is up for grabs; we must seize it for our own purposes. I will stress the need for the <em>Few</em> first, however, as without those men Nietzsche eagerly anticipated all remains straw. </p>

<p>Have you seen IronMarch's very own 'National-Action' group? It's pathetic. One of their articles defines a nationalist as being someone who's openly "Racist and antisemitic." These people are ludicrous. Before we can bury the liberal order, we must bury these knuckle-dragging tendencies that are making a mockery of our cause. </p>
