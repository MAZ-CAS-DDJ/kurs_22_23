<p>Hey Ms. Radic. Lassie. Blue eyes. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wub.png" alt=":wub:" /></p>

<p>I'm writing this now for you to read when you're back from work/ whenever. Nothing important to say, just about to go to bed, and I've been giggling like a boy ever since you called me Stiv. So... yes... This is just to say hi. Hope you're good, and kids are behaving, and you remain un-raped and non-deaded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And I'm rambling. Night! <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
