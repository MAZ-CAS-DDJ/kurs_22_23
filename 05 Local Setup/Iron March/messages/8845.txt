<p>wow, 5 foot 8? Normal height. I actually had to use a converter to change that to feet to properly visualise it. Fun fact, even though we use metric here, everybody talks about people's heights in feet for some reason. Anyway, I say wow because my ex was a midget and like 5 foot 2.</p>

<p>I'm exactly 6 foot.</p>

<p>Also <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> nobody has ever worn a sweater here or anything made of wool, ever. You'll have to send me a plane ticket to somewhere cold too.</p>

<p>Good morning btw. Well it's not morning, but it's the earliest I could get on the computer so... nevermind. What are lasses up to today?</p>
