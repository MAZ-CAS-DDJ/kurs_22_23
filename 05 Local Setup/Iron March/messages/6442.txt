<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">Good to hear the younger TBG crowd are Traditionalist, etc. but I’m a tad disconcerted and disappointed that their(?) effort at a British Generation Identity group, was a) misconceived from the start (instead of radicalism and vitality they presented us with bourgeois aesthetics, grandad-nationalism, and a kind of forced/superficial patriotism), and <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_cool.png" alt="B)" /> seems to have ground to a halt after doing next to nothing in the real world. Correct me if I’m wrong though.</span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">I do like the idea of injecting British conservatism with perennialist Traditionalism in the Guenon-mould. You could potentially attract ha hell of a lot of people to our ideas through being the only visible variant of conservatism with a robust and coherent set of ideas which clearly explains the world and history.</span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">And vanguardism; where do we start…</span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">First of all, we need to develop a worldview – a set of ideas and principles, which explains the world and history. To a large extent I believe the Traditionalists have already done this for us. I do however have my own version of Traditionalist politics – not necessarily a new Traditionalist theory, per se, but the development of something that was only ever hinted at and alluded to in the works of Guenon or Evola. Yet I believe that this ‘new’ way of looking at things offers by far and away the best way of understanding everything which is of relevance to us – as well as the most efficient means of explaining all things meta-political to others.</span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">You see, the Traditionalist have a concept called ‘inversion.’ It’s basically the idea (which you’ll no doubt agree with) that modernity can best be summed up as the turning upside down of all values. I haven’t managed to yet think up a decent name for my development of this concept, so for know I just refer to it as ‘the bifurcatory nature of inversion’ (just rolls off the tongue, huh?) It’s the observation that although there is only one Good, one True, and one Beautiful; you don’t have to create a mirror-image reversal of them or <em>anything</em> to ‘invert’ them. You can invert or negate a thing in many different ways by denying just one part of it – thus there are often two or more seemingly unrelated inversions of everything we value.</span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">I first came up with the idea when thinking about aesthetics and modern art, so I may as well give that as an example. I was watching some science-type documentary where they were explaining the concept of entropy, and it occurred to me that whereas all real art displays a high degree of order; modern art is pretty much a deliberate display of disorder. So I wondered, “what exactly <em>is</em> order?” I came up with this crude approximation: order is ‘harmonised complexity’ – order = harmony + complexity. It then seemed obvious that if we believe modern art to be a deliberate attempt at disorder – a definite (albeit unconscious) negation of order/the Beautiful – then we can account for the vast bulk of modern art, not as an attempt to reduce order by way of reducing <em>both</em> harmony and complexity; but an attempt to reduce order by way reducing <em>either</em> harmony <em>or</em> complexity. The exceptions are also accounted for indirectly by this concept.</span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">I then noticed analogous examples in the philosophical and social worlds. For example, Traditional ontology becomes both ‘all is objective’ and ‘all is subjective’ – seemingly opposites, but in reality just two means of negating the same thing. Same deal with modern social trends: the Traditional ideal of the male, as possessing both masculine and moral qualities, appears to have given way to males who either want the world to see them as macho thugs (conspicuous display of amorality) or as fundamentally good people, who ought to be valued for what’s on the inside despite a lack of masculine qualities such as strength or courage (conspicuous display of effeminacy.) Again different means of negating the same ideal.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;"> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">And of course, I began to ponder politics-proper (already being of a very right-wing and nationalist persuasion.) And it goes here as much as anything. You have the Traditionalist idea of the social whole as ‘organic’ – as the hierarchical ordering of differentiated components into a harmonious whole. How would you invert this if you were reactively seeking to negate it? Well, you could keep the differentiated elements but get rid of the harmonising wholism (liberalism); or you could keep the harmonic whole but get rid of the differentiation between its elements (socialism.) And of course there are those in between which mix-and-match.</span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">OK, I’ll tell you more about my ideas for vanguardism in coming posts, lest this one turn into an accidental dissertation. Obviously, it’s no good having these ideas if we lack the means to spread them. So we’ll discuss ideas relating to how a vanguard should approach propaganda, etc. My ideas on spreading this worldview includes extensive use of imagery (along with text), as opposed to just using mountains of text. People understand and remember much better when it’s imagery + text, than when it’s text alone.</span></span></span></p>
