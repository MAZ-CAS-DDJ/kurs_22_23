<p>Don't expect much on Iron March in the way of politeness and mutual respect of ideas - we all get along in our own fashion, but there is a certain amount of insult throwing around, don't take it too seriously. Especially not anything from Fascist Capitalist.</p>
<p>While I disagree with you on a lot of issues that you outlined in your intro, it'd be a shame if we chased away another new member. So, stay calm, as they say.</p>
