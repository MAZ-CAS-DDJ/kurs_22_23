<p>I know about Gramsci... The organization we have will be limited to my country only, we're doing a real life thing using our connections. But we will write about more wide subjects, that's why I'd need some help. It's a good project, all the people involved are in the scene for years and can be trusted, I hope this will be a start towards a real fascist organization here. The problem is that in the last few years we weren't active enough, there are hundreds of people I know who can help (in my country alone) but were inactive in last years because nothing was going on.</p>

<p>The reason I contacted you is because I really like the style of your posts, this is the sort of style and arguments I'd like our organization to have, so that we don't look like some drunk skinheads. We'll still retain a radical image thouhg</p>
