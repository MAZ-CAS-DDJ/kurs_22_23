<p>Good to see that we are on the same line after all. The few details we disagree on are really not all that important, our general outlook is the same.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks a lot and may God bless you and the true Russia too!</p>

<p>You're welcome Svitanok,</p>

<p>I will say this though, from what i've seen this forum is pretty sad and hateful, with a few exceptions, but somewhat better intellectually than other forums i've been on. If I remain active here, it will be from Aryan and Orthodox Compassion. Nonetheless, are there other forums you are on? I used to be on stormfront myself, with pretty much the same experiences as on here. Well, God Bless Ukraine and you and all your folk!</p>
