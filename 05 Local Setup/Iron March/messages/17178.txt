	God I just read Oakleaf's posts in the paganism thread. He's wrong and a retard. Hitler did not think paganism was stupid and bad, he thought the pagan movement in Germany was stupid and bad. Big difference. Hitler himself had written a poem and devotion to Odin during WW1 and had de-Christianised Christmas in Germany (which is called Weihnachten. Nothing to do with Christianity or Christ to begin with). That said, he had respect for the Christian faith too but like most people on his side, would be disgusted with how the church is today. I will stress that Christianity in and of itself is not bad but the churches are pretty bad. They are churches of the world not churches of the faith. The same goes for all religious institutions. It is the Kali Yuga after all..
