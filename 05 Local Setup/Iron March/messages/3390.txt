<p>Damn straight. It's a reason I've always admired the Klan, up until more recently, they were not afraid to get their hands dirty. By instincts, most white males are against degeneracy like paedophilia and non-whites parading around their country; they've just been neutered by feminists and leftism. Besides semen, the next thing most consumed by a woman is dogma, it's natural as they are followers. You'll see that politically it is always the women who are the most vocal and annoying.</p>
<p>I'm not the biggest Orwell fan, but I have read him, and this quote comes to mind.</p>
<p><strong>It was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy.â€™</strong> - Nineteen Eighty-Four</p>
<p>If you can appeal to a male's primal instincts you've got him, Rockwell was right there. Women are dealt with easily, just tease them and don't be ashamed to be openly sexist and remember that they're not on an equal level with you, debating logically with a woman is pointless. I posted a bit more about it in the neo-feminism thread.</p>
<p>Not all white people are good, but that isn't necessary for white supremacy, by rights these people shouldn't be called white. I follow Evola's three degrees of racism criteria.</p>
