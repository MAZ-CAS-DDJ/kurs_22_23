<p>If you've got time tho, wouldn't mind <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/3853-why-were-wn-so-cool-back-then/page-4#entry98937" rel="">this post</a> being made into its own thread in the AusNZ Historic Movements section- call it Australian Nationalists Movement. Sine Labe scanned a book written by the ANM's leader and we're going to throw some quotes and discussion up on it, would be good to have all that plus my original write-up in a place that's more accessible than a random post in Cancer.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
