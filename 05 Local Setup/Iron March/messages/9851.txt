<p>Ah, it's difficult... I trust myself less to be able to make the subject easy for my father... Though we are more alike I think he is more invested in my future. I don't know how to explain it. If figure he has enough on his plate without his daughter choosing the most hated ideology of the past hundred years!</p>
<p>I hope so! If not I'll just leave my stuff at my friend's place and sleep in the dorm lounge/couchsurf. Showers are free at the college, bless them!</p>
<p>I love manual labor. Didn't get to see my dad, just cleaned up. I made a great dinner tonight. Thai peanut chicken! My sister is making mascarpone cake, I'm getting berries to have with it soon!</p>
