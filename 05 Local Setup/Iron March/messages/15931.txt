	Hola Marcos!
</p>

<p>
	So how was your first two weeks of University? Any signs of good people there?
</p>

<p>
	I watched some videos of Hogar Social Madrid, and you are better than I expected. Strong guys, nice girls, social action and a badass motto referring to a badass knight. Keep up the good work! You should activate yourself on the forums too. There is a topic on Hogar Social Madrid here on IronMarch and it is almost empty despite of the large numbers of the Spanish newcomers. Bring those guys together, talk with them in Spanish, build the community and cook up something together. There is nothing worse than inactivity!

	You still have two weeks to finish your Fascist homework. How was the movie?
