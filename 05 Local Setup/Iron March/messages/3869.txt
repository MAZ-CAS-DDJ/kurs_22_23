<p>Right now we're still in the educating and growing part of the movement. Once the NBU starts to make waves and have some successes in Britain i'm sure things will start to get rolling here. In the meantime I"m just concentrating on building a membership base here in the states. My long term goal is to mold the organization in the image of Casapound, and Golden Dawn, make it more than a political party, a social organization that resembles a family. For now if you could spread the word amongst friends and anyone you might think would be interested it would be greatly appreciated, membership is free all you have to do is go to the website and fill out the application.<a href="http://newbritishunion.org/" rel="external nofollow">http://newbritishunion.org/</a></p>
