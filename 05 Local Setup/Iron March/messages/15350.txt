	I will be limiting the amount of time, I spend on this page. I am saddened as I see nothing has changed for the better in the last 15 years. All I see is infighting. It is as bad as the Chruchians. Two baptist churches can be on the same road but they can never get along. One church is always evil.  I see the same BS here.

	Let's talk more outside of here. I live in the very Northeast tip of Harris and Montgomery county. You have an An older brother now.  We will have a beer soon.   Just don't come preaching at me if your Identity Christian. I had enough of that when I was with Aryan Nations and White Kamelia Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
