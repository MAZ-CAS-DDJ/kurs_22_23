	Hi, my Greetings thread seems to have been closed;<br />
	Does that mean I've passed the introductory phase? Can I now post anywhere like a regular member?<br />
	If I missed something in regards to how to check this status of mine somewhere let me know, thank you.<br /><br />
	Btw what did you mean with the SI-SI-SI image needed a little fix? did I botch the alignment or something? Maybe the size ratio between the text and the face?Â
