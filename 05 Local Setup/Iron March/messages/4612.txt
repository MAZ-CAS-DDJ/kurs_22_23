I've noticed you here and there and I've been meaning to ask you about it. I like reading up on american colonial history and philosophy so it got me curious.  Also, I saw your ideology was right wing libertarian/quasi-fascist. Most Americans don't like fascism, mostly because it's not American. Where do you stand on it?</p></div></blockquote>
<p>It sadly is not a prominent president, but it is a portrait of prominent American statesmen Henry Clay. Most Americans do not like fascism because they get it easily confused with Nazism or they are so brainwashed by the left that they have no idea what it means. There is so much in fascism that is so American in my understanding of it. It appeals to my beliefs about nationalism. What are your beliefs my friend?</p>
