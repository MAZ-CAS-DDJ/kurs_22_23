	Hey, just wanted to get your thoughts on something. What do you think of using a wool M43 Field Cap (a reproduction of the field cap use by the Waffen SS) for winter ware? What do you think? Good idea or too LARPY? Here are some pics. Just asking because I am thinking about maybe getting one. PS Without insignia so as not to offend the normies lol.
