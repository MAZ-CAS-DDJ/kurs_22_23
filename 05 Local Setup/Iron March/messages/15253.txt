	Quite a few of us on the forum actually. Not much reason to come to the NT unless you want to see crocodiles, heat or asians. I preferred Melbourne myself. Long story but somebody in my family runs a business here and it involves flying people to the cebu island, so i can basically get free plane tickets. I usually stay home but I had some free time so i decided to come along. Literally the only reason being to play with full autos at gun ranges. Why did you go?
