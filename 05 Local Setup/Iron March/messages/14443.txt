	The Bay Area doesn't have a white working class anymore either, it's Chinese and to a lesser degree Latino. Its whites are mostly tech yuppies, and old working-class retirees who remember the days before the '60s.<br /><br />
	Seattle is getting there with its Chinese population, but the rest of the PNW is 90% white. And even the well-off, like my mom's side of the family (timber business owners; dad worked his way up to manager), are still in-touch with labor. They're productive. That doesn't change the fact that its cities have gotten dramatically left-wing though, with huge youth migration to them. Also Microsoft is yuppiefying Seattle a bit too.<br /><br />
	Mormons basically sold out to keep their tax-exempt status in 1979, when they declared black people can become Mormons too. And now they see the high Latino birth rates in southern Colorado and the traditionally heavily-Mormon state of Nevada, and want to convert them before they reach north Colorado/north Utah/south Idaho which is where their church is mostly based.
