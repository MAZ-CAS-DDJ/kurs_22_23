<p>Shame to hear that you can't have constant access to internet. So you like like in some lonely house in the middle of nowhere? Sounds scary. I wouldn't be able to live like that, I live straight in the center. I live alone though, I have  to do all the cleaning and cooking etc. Right now I'm bored at work, working as receptionist again.</p>
