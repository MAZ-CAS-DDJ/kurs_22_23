<p>What we need more than ideas is really more of a balance in terms of personality types, honestly. Go take a look at the psychology section of the board or some of the comments around site. Even putting aside issues of practicality this forum is full of introverts, socially awkward people, melancholics, etc. (guilty). People like Ferret and Boia seem to have more real world experience and "alpha" personalities whatever their flaws, which is good. But they are a minority.</p>
