<p>You can't go wrong with Calvinism/Presbyterianism. Catholicism reminds me an awful lot of Talmudic Judaism in a lot of ways, it chooses man's tradition rather than a more rich tradition directly from God. There's actually no doctrinal chaos within Protestantism, unlike catholicism. <a href="http://contra-gentes.blogspot.com/2008/04/doctrinal-chaos-argument-one-of.html" rel="external nofollow">http://contra-gentes...ent-one-of.html</a></p>
<p>I get on better with Orthodox Christians but the differences are still significant enough to disagree with them. I've done tiling work in an Orthodox church in Ukraine before, it was a big contract, and it required me to travel there twice to finish the job off. There's more satisfaction in helping build a church than there ever could be in any "futuristic" skyscraper project. I always refused work projects and contracts in Dubai because I'm not a big fan of that architecture, I've always thought it was tacky.</p>
<p>Protestantism is minimalistic but that's a good thing. A heirarchy still exists in protestantism, but more emphasis is put on god and his tradition which is more rich, rather than a popes or a priests. People hear the word tradition and jizz their pants over it, when in actual fact it's often a quite progressive "tradition". I think most catholics dream of crusades again, but that will never happen because the catholic church has denounced them and will not be doing any more now or in the near future. It has become the most liberal denomination of all, but these are issues I leave off the forum out of respect, as long as catholics don't attack protestantism.</p>
<p>There are aesthetics in protestantism but it's not idolatarous or over the top. If for example you got to google images and type in presbyterian churches you'll see what I mean. Speaking for myself and from experience, a lot of Calvinists are as politically incorrect as you can get, many of them are racialists too and most outsiders consider Calvinists to be racists, an accusation which doesn't seem to bother most of us. It's interesting to note that Westboro Baptist Church pastor Fred Phelps took influence from John Calvin. I don't particularly like Fred Phelps methods of protest, his financial history (civil rights lawyer... in his words, for easy money), or his entire theology, but on most principles he is correct. I particularly like his written articles on God's hatred and the design of his websites in general, it certainly gets the backs up of the humanist Christians and the WBC certainly serve their purpose, even if they're not entirely on mark. I'd have always thought of Christianity as a pacifist religion were it not for Phelps and co. As soon as I saw their notorious signs, I just said "FUCK YES!", it was refreshing to see. My favourite being "Jews worship the rectum."</p>
