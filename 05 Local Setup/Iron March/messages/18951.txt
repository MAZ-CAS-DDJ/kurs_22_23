	No problem I figured something was going on. Great to hear, yeah it's just hypothetical right now as we are putting it all together but we are looking for guys to train security forces OR take part in combat. Won't be in Canada, it will likely be in a developing country in Africa or the Middle East. Payment will be 50 euros/day minimum. Just float the idea with him to see if he's interested or he knows anyone that is, I don't have any concrete details yet as we are just planning it all out right now and I need to know how many guys I can get potentially. Thanks, really appreciate it
