	Greetings my friend! What's up?
</p>

<p>
	I am still working on some designs for you (but it looks like I am fucking slow), and I still need the correct fonts. :D
</p>

<p>
	I am talking a lot with <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/13461-fascistkurd/&amp;do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13461" href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/13461-fascistkurd/" rel="">@FascistKurd</a> nowadays, and I want us to have a conversation between him, you, and the half-Algerian guy I mentioned in another message. It would be good to have a talk about religion, geopolitics, and about the situation in North Africa and in the Middle East. Maybe we could also prepare some texts for IronMarch (about topics the people don't really know anything about - El Maadi for example). What's your opinion?
</p>
