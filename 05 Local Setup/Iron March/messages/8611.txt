<p>Seems to be going worse then considering the sun is ahead of mercury counter clockwise. This would mean getting even poorer, at least by own force to aquire material things?</p>

<p>Another super esoteric astrology question. I've not really been able to grasp just what the 8:th house means. ''Death'' feels quite vague. Read it's wider than that, that it can be pretty much everything in some way ''ending'' (contracts as an example if I am not misataken). Could you explain the meaning of the 8:th house a bit clearer? How would it relate to the planets in my natal and how that then would turn if it would be let's say Saturn ruling it insted. Again, thank you for your time man. Really appreciating the help.</p>
