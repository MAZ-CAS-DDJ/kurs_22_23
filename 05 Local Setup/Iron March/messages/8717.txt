<p>Anzac Day activism is a good time to strike when the irons hot, patriots about, national fervour is strong and military parades/marches are being held across the country, even if you couldn't put anything up on Anzac Day, the previous or day after would still be effective...being a long weekend/holiday there are more cars about and human traffic...added media attention as well, JVT's 'Asians out or Racial War' Anzac campaign is inspirational, as for ideas on an Anzac Day propaganda campaign, I've got a mate willing to help me hand out small fliers and put bigger ones on tactical spots </p>
<p>A5 or smaller flier: </p>
<p>The ANZACS didn't die so </p>
<p>You could become a slave to </p>
<p>international capitalism. &amp; Interest servitude controlled by foreign parasites !</p>
<p>Your suns and daughters could die In middle eastern wars and watch your brothers in South Africa &amp; Rhodesia perish! </p>
<p>Your lands invaded by the same foreign hordes the diggers tried to keep out!</p>
<p>Your farm land bought and sold abound! </p>
<p> your children's soul's eroded by liberal, Marxist &amp; Hollywood agendas!</p>
<p>Free yourself White Man! </p>
<p>Become a man above time !</p>
<p>Australian Action</p>
<p>+ A3 posters of one of those points each. Put up on Power poles, bus shelters &amp; electrical control boxes, I could do this easily even during the day driving around on my time off. </p>
<p>I sort had in mind that 'Bruder you killed me' SS meme for inspiration. </p>
<p>Now this was just a quick brainstorm and only aimed at Anzac Day propaganda, would be awesome if you could give us some feedback as to whether or not those points, in your opinion, are basically a re-hash of Aus first rhetoric or un-fit for IM tier propaganda, In the long run though 3 or 4 good strait forward slogans would be ideal, I agree ratbag, the JVT was right may be effective in a sticker and poster form but would need to be deigned to fit so, all this sort of depends on whether or not Kalash has time, as an Australian Action logo would also needed to be done up, any ideas on that?</p>
