	Music is a connection to the world of thoughts and emotions beyond our world , music is literally religious existing both within the material world as sound but as an interpretation of that sound outside the material world. Metaphysics bro , I wrote my philosophy class paper back a few semesters on ideas coming from outside the material world meaning that something beyond our material world exists.

	basically that we are aware of things that can enter our minds that come from somewhere that have a structure. Think about it your ideas aren't just chemical connections in the brain because we can think of abstract things that have no material basis. But we give them structure that can't be seen our felt , so where did the form of that come from, our minds connect with reality that transcends ours.
