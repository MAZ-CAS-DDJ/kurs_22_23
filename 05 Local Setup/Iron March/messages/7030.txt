<p>Well said. For 3 years as an interest in race I'd learned as much as I could about genetics and race, which wasn't an entire waste of time but in a debate it's meaningless because nobody understands it anyway and why over complicate something which can be put in simpler terms. Whether a person's behaviour is environmental, cultural, genetic or how much of each of those variables is entirely irrelevant. It just is what it is. You don't need to know the massive history of fascism, race or even communism to shut a commie up, it usually takes one simple statement about their history or a simple fact and it ends the conversation if you even dignify them with a response in the first place. No need to throw scientific facts at them.</p>
<p>My number of friends has been cut down massively since we've grown up and most have gone their own ways but I was pretty much friends with most people in our district, I had well over 150 people I'd have classed as friends and about 100 people I'd class as being on good terms with today. Even the people who aren't openly fascist aren't against it and are fascists at heart and by their actions.</p>
<p>You're right that it's either going to be the 90s era (and their kids) who do it or nobody, we were the last era to actually know what a real school bully was and it still be somewhat accepted as a normal part of life. Some say it was a lack of discipline in our era which made kids go off the rails and act up, I say it was the sense of adventure. Even when we had playstation it was always fifa games, wrestling, racing or fighting and that was hardly ever because our parents didn't want a house full of energy filled lads or gobby girls so they sent us out to play. Everybody pays too much attention to the rules, nobody gave a shit about no ball game signs or people "loitering".</p>
