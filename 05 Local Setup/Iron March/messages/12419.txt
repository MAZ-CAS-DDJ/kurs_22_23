<p>Always have been into philosophy and history. You don't need to worry about getting into Valhalla too much. You die an honourable warriors death and you'll be remembered for it. The Wehrmacht and SS are definitely worthy of Valhalla, but only half of the chosen go there, the others go to Freyja's realm of Folkvangr.</p>

<p>You can of course take a more literal interpretation of the afterlife, as Valhalla literally means "Hall of the chosen". So it would essentially just be a burial mound for the most honourable.</p>
