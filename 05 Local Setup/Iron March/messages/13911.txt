	Okay, here's the thing. And DO NOT FREAK OUT. That's what I did, and it doesn't help. Here's the thing: you've done nothing wrong. You haven't done anything wrong, and the police have nothing against you. Screen shots aren't evidence. Anyone can change the text on any screen very easily. IP addresses aren't exact. That's why they don't know it was you. Next, don't talk to the police. You don't have to talk to the police. If the police want to talk, you will only be putting yourself at risk by talking. They aren't going to arrest you. Just don't talk. And if they keep insisting, remember your 5th amendment rights :) you don't have to talk. Just tell them you won't talk without immunity or a lawyer or attorney etc. they will leave you alone. They have nothing on you, and you have all the deniability in the world. This guy has my IP too. He even knows my school. But I'm not concerned because there is no evidence anyone did anything wrong. So just calm down. And talk to Slavros. He'll coach you :)Â
