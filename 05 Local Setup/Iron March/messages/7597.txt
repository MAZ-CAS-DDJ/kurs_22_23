<p>I'm currently reading 'Introduction to Magic', and trust me I'm being critical. I'm just curious about the chapter 'THE HERMETIC CADUCEUS AND THE MIRROR'. It honestly seems to be....ridiculous. I read up on 'Astral Light' and then ended up at 'Astral Projection' and I'm wondering if Evola actually tried any of that shit. It's also pretty creepy to read, regardless of the fact that it's probably bullshit.</p>
<p>What's your take on all that?</p>
