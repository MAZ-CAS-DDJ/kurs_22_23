<p>Well, Estonia suffered alot of USSR-occupation and that's why there are large russian minority causing problems. Even russians in Russia mostly dislikes them, I have heard. However, otherwise Estonia don't have almost any immigrants, neither foreign refugees, it is cheaper, less taxes and not so liberal than current Finland (I mean our "elite", not whole nation).<br /><br />Thank you also for your time and writings. Surely this will be beginning on that, Brother. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /><br />Â </p>
