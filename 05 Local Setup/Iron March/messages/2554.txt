<p>Indeed. I would not say anything about Jewish ancestry on this forum though. No matter how you mean it, you will make some enemies. You could be the tallest whitest, blondest, and fairest specimen on the planet. Many here would not care. And by many I mean about 10-15 posters.</p>
<p>Yes, Ahimeir. He wanted Israel to ally with Italy and Germany as an ethnic nationalist state. Of the Third Reich, I like Hitler the most though. There is evidence to suggest that when Hitler ordered some Jews deported, they were killed behind his back by GÃ¶bbels in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>There is evidence, in fact, of letters. In one instance, a train of Jews (I think Polish?) went to Latvia. The German command said "Do not liquidate." Unfortunately, this message was not received until after they had been killed.</p>
<p>But there is not proof to show the high command (specifically Hitler) were always aware of this.</p>
<p>I am not familiar with National Futurism. What is it? And what is Post Industrial National Socialism?</p>
