<p>Yes, things are enormously fucked and it is a culture shock - Torren was showing me adopt us or some site, and how all the kids listings imply they were raped. This is unheard of - well it happens, but it is usually news worthy. Re Ralee, I mean she will take enormous shit - not violence or anything like that, but she takes burden in her stride - don't know how to explain it but I have never seen loyalty like it - it is mesmerising.</p>

<p>I am not really allowed to work in the US, I am not even on a visa - I am literally here as an internet Nazi. </p>

<p>Torren was quiet for the first day, mostly - I chalk it to awkwardness. Then again he was already selling drugs at the airport and screaming about/at niggers for the ride back. When we went back to the city after a purchase(so he is walking around with it), we stumble into a Jewish museum which had a dorky security guard with a fucking metal detector - this place is total silence, people talk in whispers - Torren screams HAIL HITLER! And runs out. He changes personality  a lot I think - today was a rough day, possibly the worst, lots of tears and screams (this isn't even drugs) but after 9 hours we are sitting down and laughing, watching YouTube - so far I have kept out of the way. I know a lot of people who would have freaked the fuck out, and tried to intervene. Please never mention this, I am only telling you because he trusts you more than any of us.</p>
