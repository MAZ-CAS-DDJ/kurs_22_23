<p>My journey was a very long one. I was a liberal, social democrat, Trotskyist, traditional Marxist-Leninist, Stalinist, and Islamist. I have managed to create a philosophy that mixes Stalinism, Fascism, black nationalism, and Islamism.</p>
<p>I was born in 1995. I was born in the United States. I converted to Islam when I was 12.</p>
<p>I know that the Philippines was colonized by the whites and Japanese. Sadly, your country is still unable to shake off white influence. My white friend told me, it is very easy to get laid there if you're white. According to him, girls love the fact that he had blue eyes. It's disgusting, only women influenced by propaganda would prefer white men. They're so ugly, they are like soulless ghosts. God has really put a curse on the white man. He's basically Faust.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the liberal propaganda has managed to survive in your country. Thankfully, Islam will take care of the degeneracy for Africa. How do you plan to combat the degeneracy of the west?</p>
<p>FascistCapitalist, is a fool. I can't believe he called you a "gook". What a cracker. He can't defend his own ideology without ad hominems.</p>
<p>My goal is for an African Empire. I want Africa to be united and I want a greater Africa. Meaning that I want the southeastern United States, Haiti, certain islands of the Caribean, ect. to be apart of the empire. Islam, Catholicism, and African folk religion will be the state religions. Thankfully, Muhammad (PBUH) created a decent economic system and political structure. There are a revisions tho for it to adapt to the modern world.</p>
<p>What do you think of Alexander Slavros and Aristocrat?</p>
