	The national Monarch is a modern phenomenon; Traditionally Monarchs were a separate nation, and they weren't mixing with the people they ruled, so they were more closer to other Monarchs than to the nation. Aristocracy worked similar, they had to keep their noble bloodlines pure. What about the Voivods? What's the difference between them and the kings?

	I am quite surprised that you are supporting the federation, Romanian Nationalists are tend to be Isolationists too. I agree with you, but alliances like V4+ or New Byzantium could be the basis of a greater federation. Eastern Europe rules!

	History is something we should completely re-discover as soon as there is a higher legitimacy (like the federation we were talking about), because today it is tainted by the countless layers of Chauvinism, and we have to do that in a way we can also keep our Mythologies intact. What you say is basically true, but I have read similar things about Romanians, that your ancestors were migrated from Illyricum (Western Balkans). Regardless of this, the first thing we need to agree upon is the hierarchy of the historical factors. Which one is more important: identity, genetics, language, geography, archaeology, sources, legitimacy, etc.? If you pay attention to these debates you will see that there is only one thing behind the arguments, and that's self-interest. Unless we replace this with the Will for Truth, these discussions will be fruitless.

<p>
	I know what bozgor means, that's Hungarian-Romanian relations 101. :D

			If you're going to make claims on the way the population is spread out, then we should get zones from Serbia, Macedonia (aromanians), Moldova as a whole, parts of Bulgaria and Ukraine, not to mention very big chunks of Transylvania.

	I prefer historical-geographical regions rather then the population, for the latter could be very unstable in the long run. Banat is a good example, it was always treated as a whole throughout the Middle Ages then came Trianon and they cut it up between Romania and Serbia according to the ethnicity of the population. Or see the example of Moldavia what was also divided into four parts (Moldova, Bessarabia, Chernivtsi and Budjak). I know about the Vlachs scattered around on the Balkans, for they are usually used as an argument for the theory of the Romanian migration. There is a very small Hungarian minority in the same situation, the Csángós. They land where they live was never a part of Hungary, and it shouldn't be either. Communities like these have to be protected instead (with full cooperation with the region they live in ofc), since they became one with the land they lived on for hundreds of years - neglecting this fact is the denying of Truth.

	That's something we Fascists certainly have to do sooner or later. Without the coordination and the cooperation of our nations and the concrete goals we will end up fighting against each other again, and thus loosing another historical chance for rising up against the real enemy.

	True. The enemy I was talking about is already inside, and it is exactly by focusing on him together with our historical rivals is how we can locate and defeat him.
