	Even if you don't find the girl attractive you can usually find some nice qualities about them, like nice blue eyes or nice hair (if it's not dyed). Up to you how you go about it, sorta depends on your personality. Confidence helps and the best way to build it is either to see everyone as below you, or to have more experience with those sorts of things.

	Good luck with your studies and learning German / other languages too. Feel free to ask me for advice with that, I might be able to help out.
