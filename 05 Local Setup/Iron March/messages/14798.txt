	No you should finish because then you'll have a degree. after that then you can make a crazy decision your getting a better degree than me anyways I can't do shit with a bachelors in history but mechanical engineering is good. Although like you said you don't want to end up as a white collar faggot I don't want to end up as a white or blue collar faggot I wear crew necks homie i'm no collar if you get my drift. ( I don't want to be apart of the system).Â
