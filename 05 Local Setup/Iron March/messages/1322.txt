<p>Again I wont debate Economics unless you press the issue. Call me a Marxist all you want, I'm not because I don't view humans as capital. Similarly I'm not a racist or an Anti-Racist I'm a (mostly, part Turk) white man who tends to date Asian women and lives around a ton of Tejanos, but I also wont bash a Racist for being Racist.</p>
<p>I just wonder how and why you intentionally try and refrain from being diplomatic, even when people aren't worth it, your reputation has been damaged. Embrace it if you want, but I'd like the Americans to look a little more presentable. Just rationalize this for me, please.</p>
