	Thanks for your advice, it was very helpful! I have seen both Coleman and Gelert tents here, but we were planning on buying a really big one like a 4 man tent for playing cards while drinking in the evenings. I guess it wouldn't be as expansive as buying a tent for each of us. We will find out anyway.

	Good luck with Drifting in the future. :D
