<p>Me being "directly aggressive" towards you will literally turn every thread you post in into an absolute shitstorm. Mostly because a small percentage of your "directly aggressive" attacks have any substance to it. Can you imagine if I respond to all your "hurr durr you're a Jew" with "hurr durr you're a nutter"? Thread-ruining madness. I'd rather not do that. If you call avoiding spergy confrontation "passive aggression" then I really could give no fucks. "Like a man" is not saying faggot and kike until people try to avoid you. There's standing up for yourself and then there's weird awkward yelling.</p>
<p>And if you have any online materials on Degrelle that isn't in our fascist archive, I'd love to see them. I have a feeling I'll like Rexism quite a bit if it replaces the NS pagan esoteric/Evolan silliness with Christian doctrine (like it seems to be doing) while keeping everything else.</p>
