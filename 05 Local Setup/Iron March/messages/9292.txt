<p>It's hard to find out your parents are so flawed, so different from how you saw them when you were young. I saw all the same thins, I just didn't know they were flaws yet.</p>
<p>My parents were off and on too.</p>
<p>I took care of my dad for almost a year. The muscles in his mouth and throat stopped working first, so he would always choke. He wouldn't see a doctor, so I fed him smoothies one spoon at a time. He lost so much weight. He is six foot four and he was down to 140 pounds. He didn't look in a mirror for months, I would always hang a towel over it when I helped him wash. Then he once looked while I was getting the towel, and he said, I look like a Holocaust survivor! So I called his eating the Dachau Diet. </p>
