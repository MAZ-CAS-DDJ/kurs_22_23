<p>Heh, considering I'm still looking for a part-time job, I'm in the same boat. Are you still at the age where you have to sneak around giving excuses to your parents? Some excuses would be helpful, as traveling across the country needs a watertight alibi. I can't make Swansea, and not sure about Yorkshire, but if there's stuff happening in London, I'll be able to (allowing for exam prep), especially come next year.</p>
