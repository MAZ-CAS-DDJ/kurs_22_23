<p>Fuck it, I'll stay.</p>
<p>Here's some portraits for proof (includes: Volkov, Ushakov/Von Nottbeck, and the smaller pics are of Ivelich bloodlines, portraits not pictured include French aristocracy; Gria):</p>

<p>And to summarize what I'm doing here, on the IMF:</p>
<p>A little dude named Eduard Bernstein took Marx's Revolutionary Socialism and created a more practical revisionist variation, which we now know today as Social Democracy. It did wonders for the Nordic economies, right?</p>
<p>In my opinion, orthodox Fascism should be open for that similar form of revisionism.</p>
<p>I don't mean castrating it, but making it smarter and more accessible to the public.</p>
<p>But hey, whatever survives in the long-run.</p>
<p>Why not more pictures of proof while we're at it?:</p>

<p>and here's a book written by my great-great-great-great grandfather Nikolai Egorovich Volkov</p>
<p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/25473_1279056550670_7200140_n.jpg" alt="25473_1279056550670_7200140_n.jpg" /><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/25473_1279056590671_6326848_n.jpg" alt="25473_1279056590671_6326848_n.jpg" /><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/25473_1279056630672_2215504_n.jpg" alt="25473_1279056630672_2215504_n.jpg" /></p>
<p>They were really into the whole 'detailing our bloodline so that we have proof for inheritance' sort of thing.</p>
<p>The dude himself:</p>

<p>and a photograph of the Czar, a rather egotistical gift, but a treasured item nevertheless:</p>

<p>Oh, and here are the remaining portraits that weren't pictured in the original pic, of the Gria family:</p>
