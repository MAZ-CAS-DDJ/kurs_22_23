<p>Yes, although there is no place of worship that really agrees with that doctrine nearby (except Jehovah's Witnesses, and I have a few other issues with them, particularly with politics and war). Even the "Arian Catholic Church" that I've heard of has some weird ideas about things like the Virgin Birth, and a distinct Anglicanization/Judaization in ideas and terminology. I suppose my ideas are pretty much the same as the original ones of Arius; little change from "catholic orthodoxy" <em>of the time</em>, except with regards to the trinity. In any event, I'm planning to go on a little project of mine where I visit a service at a church of every kind practically possible in the area, simply to learn from experience.</p>
