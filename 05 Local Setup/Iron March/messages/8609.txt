<p>Hey, how are you doing purging degeneracy and all?</p>
<p>Got a quick question about combustion near the sun and sign rulership. Looked at my own natal chart after reading one of the books for a bit, and it said that it's been a long discussion wether a combustion of a planet ruling the sign the planet is in is really that bad. Got curious considering Mercury in the Seventh house in the chart (ruled by Virgo) but within the combustion limit (8, right?) with a few degrees margin.</p>
<p>So, what happens? Cheers man.</p>
