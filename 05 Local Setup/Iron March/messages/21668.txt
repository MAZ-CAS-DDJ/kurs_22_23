	You can shitpost on the weekend and also be on Iron March. The thing is, you can't defend alt-right here while claiming to support Iron March/Atom Waffen. Pick one because you cannot be on both sides at once. I shitpost on Discord because it's fun but I don't come here to brag about it. I keep it separate. Iron March is for business not pleasure.
