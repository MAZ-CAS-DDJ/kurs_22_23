<p>Hey Venator,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's good to hear form you again. In answer to your first question I was taking a social philosophy class and on the first day she asked us to write down on an index card what we were politically, needless to say I wrote down Fascist/Nationalist. Oh and I guess that social philosophy class would got into continental philosophy a bit, but not much. However, I do not hide the fact that I am a Fascist, I'm very proud to be one, and will tell someone if they just ask. I also ware a black M65 field jacket much of the time(though not during the summer). As to the other philosophers I like I do like Evola, however I haven't had the time yet to start reading his works. It is my plan to make a "Far-right reading list" with intellectuals that we (the far-right) have drawn inspiration from. As it is my personal dream/goal to become a Fascist intellectual/philosopher for our time. I hope that you aspire to the same thing. As for what attracted me to <em>The Will to Power </em>was simply that I knew that we rightists have drawn inspiration form Nietzsche and <em>The Will to Power </em>sounded like something I would enjoy. Also, yes I do think that political movements do need a philosophical base, because we have to know what we are fighting for and its higher calling. The things I normally think about are is "might makes right" morally justified (I argue that it is), can humanity really achieve a (Fascist) Utopia, and many other things.  Anyways it was really nice to hear form you again, and remember to check your messages.</p>
