	History itself is the involution of time. You know that usually I am skeptical when it comes to Vikernes, but sometimes he is right on the spot. I just finished the Theory of Everything by Stephen Hawking (THX 4 the reading tip), and there was one line what evoked a memory of one of Varg's writings from the first Thulean Perspective blog in which he stated that time is only an illusion - it was given by the Gods who are living above time for us to be able to understand the world even as temporal beings. We wouldn't be able to perceive it all at once, thus they have "sliced it up" for us - in short, time is the explanation of existence. It becomes hazier because Mythological times were still somewhat above history. Maybe that's why the ancient civilizations were thinking in cycles instead of a linear timeline, because they were closer to the Mythological age above time; they were closer to the center of the wheel which is unmoving but moves everything around itself, they have experienced more of the eternal than of the temporal. Baranyi once mentioned that for us, myths and legends are much more closer to the Truth than most of the happenings surrounding us in the modern age - this is logical if we think of the difference between true and real: a lie for example can be real (can have presence), but it will never be true (can't have essence). We had a rather pathetic debate with Hvit Varulv where I tried to <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/7117-pope-francis-vs-cardinals/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=173458" rel="">explain this</a> to him. When you are dreaming, the persons inside your dream will never be able to experience you the dreamer, only your in-dream incarnation - this means that you are not necessarily real to them, but you are always true to them. I wanted to show you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RMHHwJ9Eqk" rel="external nofollow">this clip</a> before, but I forgot to post it.

<p>
	We, who are above the masses don't have to climb the same ladder as them. We are starting from higher positions and we are climbing faster, so you should completely separate your ways from that of the average: you have to accomplish the maximum, but for the outer world the optimum will be enough. Our goal is not a Utopia but a society in which the needs of the individual and the needs of the community are one, where your inner fight and the outer fight can strengthen each other because both are aiming for Truth. We have to be careful when talking about this (this will be our motto), but <em>everything is provided</em>. Today I have deleted a lot of shit from my PC and I have realized that subconsciously I was still thinking that I will have the time and the will to collect every great stuff available - and that's just silly. If there is a book which you will never open in your entire life than that book is empty. God is merciful thus He created a world in which you can find everything you need to understand your task and complete it. This is why in a sense nothing is important from the outer world for it is but an obstacle between you and God, and in another sense everything is important because everything is there to help you fulfilling your mission by overcome those obstacles. This means that in the end it is the Self who gives meaning to everything. Dugin was saying something similar to what you have said, that he wants to go back to the origins, he wants to cut through the layers of dead Traditions to reach their source (and with that knowledge, establish a new, living Tradition). You don't need to know everything to be able to do that.
</p>

<p>
	It is often occurs that things die with a final outburst which ensures the survival of their essence in a new form, what is more adjusted to the current conditions. In the XX. century Traditions were dying, but just before Materialism triumphed over them they erupted in the form of Fascism, and we can still feel that it was a fucking ideological Supernova. As long as we are blessed with a powerful weapon like this you shouldn't fear - the knowledge is here, we just have to obtain it.

	I don't know about this quote, but naturally it's right and it is pointing out the idea that whenever you are reaching the peak or the source of a structure, you will seize power over it. We were talking about this when I mentioned the nature of Chaos and Order, and it looks like that Wittgenstein was also referring to the same thing. I wasn't able to find the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus in Hungarian, but I will try to read it in English.
</p>

<p>
	The danger of madness is there indeed, but virtues like courage and humbleness can guide you on a safe path, and you have a couple of other gifts like intuition for example. I can thank a lot to that one to be honest: a lot of my ideas are not really mine, they are not results of trains of thoughts but appearing just like that. If I remember correctly Tesla was talking about a similar experience.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you feel like you are trapped, our Traditionalists are saying that this is the first step we take; the realization of the fundamental crisis in existence that we are separated from God. Those who are not feeling the same are all blind, those who don't wish for absolute freedom are slaves. The Evangelium is an answer to this crisis.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, your brain, moreover rationality itself can be a prison if we are looking at it from the suprarational perspective of the Spirit or if you take a look at Hvit Varulv.

<p>
	I haven't studied this topic yet, but I dug up some of my notes and I have found a model which describes the Yugas as the following:
</p>

<p>
	The Mahā-Yuga is 129.600 years long, and it is divided to 2 equal halves; an active, advancing period <em>(Opus Album)</em>, which is coming from the Absolute (God) and by Involution is moving towards the relative (Damnation), and a passive, returning period <em>(Opus Nigrum)</em>, which is starting from the relative and is moving back to the Absolute. (This means that it doesn't work the way you mentioned - we will never reach a new Golden Age (at least not a 'big' one, I will explain below), because there is a 64.800 years long Opus Nigrum between the end of the Iron Age and the beginning of the new Golden Age.) The active period is divided to 4 eras in a 4:3:2:1 rate - so the 1st era, Satya or Krta Yuga (Golden Age) is 25.920 years long; the 2nd era, Treta Yuga (Silver Age) is 19.440 years long; the 3rd era, Dvapara Yuga (Bronze Age) is 12.960 years long; and the 4th era, Kali Yuga (Iron Age) is 6.480 years long. According to the calculations of our Traditionalists the Iron Age started 3102 B.C. (with the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt by Menes, founder of the First Dynasty) and it will last until 3379 A.D. - However, the eras are having lesser eras within themselves, so the Golden Age begins with Golden-Golden Age, and then proceeds by Golden-Silver Age, Golden-Bronze Age and Golden-Iron Age before turning into Silver-Golden Age etc. These are also containing even lesser eras, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G6uO7ZHtK8" rel="external nofollow">and so on</a>, which means that there is always a chance to connect with the Golden Age literally in every second (only in lesser and lesser eras, so it's more and more difficult), with the one exception of the last moment, the Apocalypse.
</p>

<p>
	I made a quick calculation (though I don't know if it's correct or not because I am not sure if we can apply the same rates to the lesser ages):
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Iron Age: 3102 B.C. - 3379 A.D. (6480 years)</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Lesser ages within the Iron Age:
</p>

<p>
	Iron-Golden Age: 3102 B.C. - 510 B. C. (-3102 + 4 x 6480 : 10)
</p>

<p>
	Iron-Silver Age: 510 B.C. - 1435 A.D. (-510 + 3 x 6480 : 10 + 1 for year zero)
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Iron-Bronze Age: 1435 - 2731 (1435 + 2 x 6480 : 10) (1296 years)</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Iron-Iron Age: 2731 - 3379 (2731 + 6481 : 10)
</p>

<p>
	Lesser ages within the Iron-Bronze Age:
</p>

<p>
	Iron-Bronze-Golden Age: 1435 - 1953.4 (1435 + 4 x 1296 : 10) (wtf Stalin died in 05/03/1953)
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Iron-Bronze-Silver Age: 1953.4 - 2342.2 (1953.4 + 3 x 1296 : 10) (388.8 years)</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Iron-Bronze-Bronze Age: 2342.2 - 2601.4 (2342.2 + 2 x 1296 : 10)
</p>

<p>
	Iron-Bronze-Iron Age: 2601.4 - 2731 (2601.4 + 1296 : 10)
</p>

<p>
	Lesser ages within the Iron-Bronze-Silver Age:
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Iron-Bronze-Silver-Golden Age: 1953.4 - 2108.92 (1953.4 + 4 x 388.8 : 10) (155,52 years)</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Iron-Bronze-Silver-Silver Age: 2108.92 - 2225.56 (2108.92 + 3 x 388.8 : 10)
</p>

<p>
	Iron-Bronze-Silver-Bronze Age: 2225.56 - 2303.32 (2225.56 + 2 x 388.8 : 10)
</p>

<p>
	Iron-Bronze-Silver-Iron Age: 2303.32 - 2342.2 (2303.32 + 388.8 : 10)
</p>

<p>
	That's pretty interesting, and if correct, it could explain a lot of things. I don't think that Communism would ever succeed because the rule of the slaves is an oxymoron. The one who rules can't be a slave (well... spiritually speaking he can, but these guys are Atheists). I am constantly using the same argument against "civilians" (crypto-Liberals) in politics - as soon as get to the position of control you are no longer a civil.
</p>

<p>
	Either way, never get obsessed with the outer world. Focus on God and your task, not the world between You. Once I heard a very interesting idea, thinking about that can help you with this: what if God created you in this very moment along with all of your memories? Or in this moment? Or in this one? These are questions not meant to be answered. As you archaificate yourself you will embody higher eras, and if by God's grace you will complete your task and get back to the source, you will have the Philosopher's Stone and with it you will be able to turn everything into pure <em>gold</em>.
</p>

<p>
	Your life is also divided into these four periods and your death will be your subjective Apocalypse.

	I know this quote, and the first time I read it I was stunned. I know that when we are talking about personalities, it's laughable to say that "I will be the next Hitler", but if we are talking about the Self, or Solipsism, we have to see that it is indeed our duty to be the next Hitler, we have to do the same thing with ourselves what Hitler did to Germany. The Christians have one task, the 'Imitatio Christi' - to be like Christ. Esoteric Hitlerism can be similar to this in this sense. <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/6982-greetings-folks/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=167193" rel="">Meister Eckhart approves too.</a><strong> </strong>I agree that He was more than human, I see Him as somebody who reunited the castes within Himself and then in his country also in a time where others fought for the victory of the lowest principle against every other (class struggle) inside and outside as well. Hitler was a Legend in the Modern age, which is like a burning fire in the middle of a dark forest. Savitri Devi writes that the Leader Hitler was talking about is the same being every Tradition knows, the One who will come in the end of time to bring Judgement.

	I know another metaphor with the stained glass windows, it was about three people from three different churches. One of them saw the light as red, but it was green for the other one and blue for the third because of the different windows. That's how we see God, and when we are no longer able to go outside and see light as it is, somebody has to break in those windows.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Hmm. I don't think that they have replaced God with the authority of the state. First of all, the state is a very important idea in our worldview as it is even above the nation for it is the manifestation of the structure of divine hierarchy, and its head, the King symbolizes the Lord Himself. In some of the Traditional texts there is an era close to the Golden Age which they call 'Abasileia' ("without kings"), but not because everybody was a proletarian, on the contrary: because everybody was on the level of kings, thus there wasn't an appointed king between them. State is not the human-made structure with the bureaucracy and all that, but the Cosmic Order applied to society (as in an Organic State). If we are talking about the government, you are perfectly right.
</p>

<p>
	This quote from the Tao Te Ching is interesting... I was always wondered if there are secret societies on our side. It seems that this would be the ideal state, but on the other hand, when we are talking about courage, for me it means that our Leaders have to be as apparent as possible.

	Sadly Epicurus is not a rare case, I don't think that there is even a single man who wasn't misunderstood by the masses. Also don't forget the skinheads and the cosplay-nazis if we are talking about Hitler and Codreanu. :D Joking aside, it's strange how the question of heredity is ignored in our times. I am not necessarily speaking about a dynasty of a family, but that of merits, virtues, aptitude and worth. The quote by Hitler we were talking about is somehow related, but even He didn't choose anyone (as far as I know) to be prepared as an heir, while at the same time He was paying much attention to the raising of the new generation as a whole.
</p>

<p>
	This would be a natural task of the initiation centers you mentioned. I have some "romantic visions" about hidden places far away from the inhabited areas, where we could train ourselves without the constant disturbances of Modernity, but I fear those will stay dreams. We can of course consider IronMarch as an "online initiation center" - which it truly is, but theory is nothing without action.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that's very likely, but as long as the hierarchy is stable it shouldn't be a problem. On the long run though, I believe that it is necessary and possible to completely get rid of Chauvinism. The first step would be to reject the modern, Leftist-type Nationalism which was born in 1848, the same year as the Communist Manifesto. I can also mention the classes as modern forms of the castes, with each one naturally gravitating towards one of the "three political theories" in Dugin's terms:
</p>

<p>
	Indian caste / European caste / Modern class / Political view / Orientation:
</p>

<p>
	Kshatriya / Warrior / Military / Nationalism / Fascism
</p>

<p>
	Vaishya / Merchant / (((Merchant))) / Capitalism / Liberalism
</p>

<p>
	Shudra / Worker / Proletariat / Socialism / Communism
</p>

<p>
	This is of course only an overly simplified illustration. I haven't included the caste of Brahmins / Priests for a different reason though: I think that it is exactly their absence what caused Modernity; an era in which there is no stable guidance anymore, and thus what becomes the battlefield of the lower castes (religion was one of the first targets of the French revolution). Strengthen or weaken a class in itself is not enough to change the whole society, but it is certainly an important factor, and if it succeeds, the new ruling class will change the other two in its own image; that's why there are enormous differences between the warriors ruled by Priests (Knights), the ones ruled by other Warriors (SS) and those ruled by Merchants (US Army).
</p>

<p>
	Now, if classic Communism could be dissolved in the Eastern Bloc by manipulating the working class, deconstructing Chauivinism is also possible, we only have to give a new, supranational identity to the people. There are still Imperial ideas today, like the Russian or the British one, and also the nations are made up of several regional subjects, yet we can't see secessionist movements of those.

			By the way, it's funny that I've heard so many people calling Orban a "fascist." And then you have Jobbik who are actual nationalists, and people call them fascists too. But then the Traditionalists, the real tradical fascists, aren't even satisfied with Jobbik.

<p>
	Same thing with the older generation in the Slav countries - to them every Westerner is Fascist.

<p>
	Most of our Traditionalists are admiring Hamvas, but he had Humanistic sentiments in some of his writings what caused a paradox situation in which today Fascists and Humanists are both praising him in Hungary. After all, he was even a member of the Communist party for some years, and he wasn't the 'rotbraun' Stalinist-type but it's antithesis.

			But then if we're talking spiritually, then language reform is really quite dangerous, since it could butcher the language if it's not handled correctly. I suppose, here's how I see it: don't do language reforms unless a) you really very badly need to do so, and b) you know what you're doing.

<p>
	You are damn right about language reforms. Do you think it is possible to instead of eradicating the rarely used words, we would just incorporate them into the centralized language as synonyms, keeping them alive by the media?

	Oh. Yes, I know that Syrian is hardly a nation, but that's the point - it's rather a historical region, and though I don't know much about Levant I know that a dozen of different empires were occupying that space through time from the dawn of history until the fall of the Ottoman Empire. It's hard to argue against the fact that they are Semites and Kurds are Iranian, but <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Iranian_tongues-tr.svg/838px-Iranian_tongues-tr.svg.png" rel="external nofollow">how about Iran then</a>?

<p>
	Now that's a difficult situation... it's similar to that of the Poles, between the enemy on the West and the big brother on the East. <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/7202-canadian-christian-facist/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=173590" rel="">Neizbezhnost was talking about Germany</a> the same way as you did, but that's a one-sided opinion. I am all for faith and heroic action, but also for knowledge and wise planning:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<img alt="So7kv73.png" class="ipsImage" src="https://i.imgur.com/So7kv73.png" /></p>

<p>
	We have a responsibility not only for the present of our nation, but also for its past and its future:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<img alt="4Cd1XaZ.png" class="ipsImage" src="https://i.imgur.com/4Cd1XaZ.png" /></p>

<p>
	Therefore I don't believe in alliances between peoples who don't know each other historically. Azeris and Balochis are much more closer to you historically and culturally (and while an Azeri counts as a Turk, promoting the unification of Iran and Balochistan could also put you into a pro-Indian position by supporting their claims on the rest of Pakistan), but I don't think that the paranoid Balkanites would ever help a nation with a Muslim majority. Both the Greeks and the Slavs were the allies of the faraway West in the XX. century - look at them now. The Brits and the Americans used them as mere tools against power blocs which would threat their hegemony (Austro-Hungarian Empire, German Empire, Soviet Union); and as soon as there were no more threats they either left their former allies alone or waged war against them as the tide changed. In order to find a Fascist solution in Geopolitics, we have to take a look at it from a Fascist perspective. I have read an article about 'Sacred Geography' in the Traditionalist magazine I mentioned above, in which they wrote that we have to have a synthetic disciple which unites "Geography, History, Religion, Archaeology, Prehistory, Cartography, Numismatics, Heraldry, Physics, Geology, Philosophy, Astronomy, Architecture, Energetics and numerous other disciplines". Though naturally this didn't happened yet, I was thinking about something similar already for we cannot solve complex problems by using simple solutions, and "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" is a pretty basic idea.

			Yup, I'm definitely interested. :D

<p>
	Then I will try to illustrate the situation of Hungary in a nutshell:
</p>

<p>
	Our ancestors conquered the Carpathian Basin in 895, and when the Kingdom of the Holy Crown of Saint Stephen was established in 1000, Hungarians were the absolute majority. At that time Nationalism in the modern sense wasn't a thing, none of the kings cared about the nationality of the people living under their rule as long as they were loyal, thus assimilation was a slow and spontaneous phenomenon. Nation was meaning the aristocracy, and those who became a part of it became Hungarians regardless of their origin (their descendants became Hungarians by blood too because of the marriages between the aristocracy), one of our greatest king, Matthias Corvinus for example had Vlachs among his ancestors. Because of our Nomadic origin, most of the Hungarians were settled on the <a href="http://pctrs.network.hu/clubpicture/9/9/_/karpat_medence_nagyfelbontasu_terkepe_99665_255235.png" rel="external nofollow">plains of Hungary</a> (<a href="http://www.map.hu/galeria/orig/1263_a_karpat-terseg_hegy-_es_vizrajza.jpg" rel="external nofollow">our new borders for a comparison</a>), while the other ethnicities were living somewhat isolated in the mountains. This became a problem with the invasion of the Mongols and later the Ottomans since they were marching through the plains. The numbers of ethnic Hungarians were constantly dropping and our kings were inviting other peoples to protect the regions which were deserted by war (that's how we lost the southern plains to the Serbs). In this situation came the French revolution and Modern Nationalism, but even this would have been manageable if we would had the courage and the wisdom to face the challenges of the new era. There were tons of ideas made by various representatives of minorities to decentralize the Empire and with this give autonomy to the other people within the state:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Trijalisti%C4%8Dki_prijedlog_prema_NZB_1910.png" rel="external nofollow">The Trialist idea</a> would made a third subject thus making the dualist monarchy of Austrians and Hungarians into a trialist one of Austrians, Hungarians and Yugoslavs (with the leadership of Croatians). This would strengthen the Empire, making the South Slavs loyal to the Crown and thus preventing the creation of the Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia. Several concepts were made for the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Greater_austria_ethnic.svg/1024px-Greater_austria_ethnic.svg.png" rel="external nofollow">federalization of the Empire</a>, mostly from an ethnic viewpoint. Some of the Hungarian nobles supported these ideas, and Archduke Franz Ferdinand himself was a supporter of Trialism, but they weren't able to realize their plans, and by losing WW1 (which is a whole other topic) we ended up with one of the worst situations. In WW2 we were able to get back some of our lands (thanks to the Führer), and <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Hungary_1941_ethnic.svg/1280px-Hungary_1941_ethnic.svg.png" rel="external nofollow">our borders</a> were much more realistic ethnically, but those were all lost after the war, and the nations of the Carpathian Basin are hating each other since then.
</p>

<p>
	With the federalization of the Empire, we would have been able to keep it together, but even if not, we wouldn't see this irrational hatred between these nations today as back then Hungarians would just simply accept the fact that those people are going their own way. Our greatest loss is not that our country was dismembered, or that one third of our people became outcasts in hostile countries, but that the idea of a kingdom above nations and a historical mission for Christianity was lost. If we are just a bunch of small-minded people hating each other; a destabilized piece of the geopolitical playground even without the slightest chance for the recognition of higher goals it's really not that interesting which one of us has more land.

<p>
	It was just another intuition, but later I started to see how strong is the presence of Nihilism is in the everyday life. Terrorism is a good example: the people of the West were facing with this threat and they had two options, either react it by questioning their own worldview (Liberalism, Multiculturalism, Globalism) or ignore it. Most of them has chosen the latter of course, but if you don't care about the lives of innocents anymore, you will surely become irremediably apathetic. We are talking a lot about the Will to Power, but it looks like that the lack of Power to Will is becoming a greater problem.
</p>

<p>
	The Traditional authors are somewhat falling behind, you know. They are mostly older men, above the degeneracy of our generation, and because of that they don't know our problems as well as we do. That's not a problem for it's our struggle to fight; but it also means that sooner or later we will disagree on the nature of practical solutions.

	Then I definitely recommend Dugin. He is like a mystic of political ideas rather then religions. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpzxw2u1C8Q" rel="external nofollow">this video</a> by him. Although he says he is against Fascism, for me it looks like that he is criticizing mainly the (metaphysically) modern aspects of it while at the same time is talking about his Fourth Political Theory as something which is totally against Liberalism, is somewhat close to Communism and very close to Fascism. Shady guy, I wonder what's in his mind.
