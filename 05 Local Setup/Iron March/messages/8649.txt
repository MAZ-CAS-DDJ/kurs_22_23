<p>Yeah sorry I've been kinda AWOL lately guys, irl issues plus job-hunting = little time for even the online Cause (Jew $$$ before politics, the world works in shitty ways).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I actually already have done a write-up of the ANM, but I chucked it in <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/3853-why-were-wn-so-cool-back-then/page-4#entry98937" rel="">here</a> because we didn't have an Aussie section then. I think that's a pretty decent summary &amp; I can't be fucked doing a new one, tbh. It's a shitty place for it now, tho, especially in Cancer where only members can see it. I'll ask Slavros if he's okay with making it it's own thread.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've finally got some time tonight so I'm going to do another ANM thread, just writing up choice quotes from Jack's book that I've found after digging through it off &amp; on the last few months. I'll be sure to link both to my original ANM post and to Sine's upload of the PDF. Maybe get Slavros to merge my original Cancer post with the new thread.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for other movements, you're right, there's not a lot besides the League of Rights &amp; Old Guard left to cover- just One Nation really, lol. The LR is definitely NS but does little except publish stuff &amp; hold closed meetings, the Old Guard were just old-school conservatives who cared more about their loot than anything else, but even brief threads on them would be mildly interesting. I'd like to see Personalities threads on Eric Butler (League of Rights founder), Francis de Groot, Adela Pankhurst or Miles Franklin. I'd be interested in doing the last three at some point but as I said, time's an issue for me atm. I've had to put plans for actual activism on hold which sucks. I don't have much info on Kiwi groups, but yeah their scene seems pretty active- <a href="http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com/voice-of-albion-w-paul-hickman-5-25-14/" rel="external nofollow">interesting interview with a guy from the NZ Right Wing Resistance here</a>, worth a listen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doing a Stephenson/Australia First thread's a great idea Quis, I always intended to tackle that but it's a big topic. I can send you a reading list if you like, I tracked down a few books which go into depth on it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cheers for the work you've put in lately guys, scanning Jack's book, making threads, getting the forum reorganised... good stuff. Slavros actually gave the work we've put into our section a positive mention in another thread (something like "the Aussies did a good job making their own section, be like them if you want yours to survive"). Never hurts to get good words from the Fuhrer. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_laugh.png" alt=":lol:" /></p>
