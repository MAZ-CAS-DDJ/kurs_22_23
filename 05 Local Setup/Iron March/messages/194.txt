<p>Vladimir is not gagged, at least as far as I know. Your gag was instituted by a member of the Adminship and was put in place independently of the actions I warned you for; whilst taking them into account. If you would like I will speak with Benjamin about getting your gag down to a moderated posting status.</p>
