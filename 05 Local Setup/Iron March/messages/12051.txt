<p>hey raven, thanks for messaging. theres been a few times I felt their were near, first time was when I was first studying paganism but still just considered it sorta silly myths and stories more than a religion.but I felt compelled to go for a walk, and on a thursday (thors day), a storm came from the west and when I came to the top of a hill, I saw the shape of a hammer appear in the clouds and lightning spewed from its sides. I took it as a sign to study the lore more and decided to focus my worship towards thor</p>

<p>another time I had a hallucination (was during my high school days) where I had been smoking hippie weed but got heat stroke out in the desert at the same time. I felt everything as if I was in 3 planes of existence, looking upwards from the ground and downwards from the sky, all while existing on the ground too. it was disorienting and maddening, I was puking frequently and got to a point I couldnt even stand. before I passed out, I looked upwards towards the mountains and I saw the cliff faces turn into the faces of kings with beards and helmets, and gods, all looking down upon me. their gaze was both inspiring and frightening; i could not stand to look at them for more than a few seconds.</p>

<p>those are the only two really vivid experiences ive had that I remember. whenever I attend my shrine I act and feel as if the gods are in my presence, as if they have temporarily come down and possessed my idols of them in order to witness my offerings. I take approaching the shrine pretty seriously and do certain things before doing so, I always cut my nails, wash myself and bring at least something to offer every time. I try to mimic everything the germans did when venerating the gods</p>

<p>as far as esotericism, ive only really just started reading alot of occult and esoteric things. for a long time I assumed alot of it was wiccan nonsense or too warped by christian viewpoints to be of any use but many grimoires and occult writings are very much worth taking a look, I would highly recommend henry agrippa if you have the time. guido von list is also a classic when it comes to germanic occultism but be warned, im still not really sure if he was a madman or a prophet. he predicted that kaiser wilhelm II would win the great war and establish a great pagan empire across europe. either he was wrong or his visions were from the wrong parallel universe</p>

<p>sorry for wall of text btw, i usually overexplain things</p>
