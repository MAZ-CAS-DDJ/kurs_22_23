	Thanks for the tip. Image editing is something i would like to know in cases of emergency and for various uses although i didn't have time to invest some serious effort in it. I was observing the sputniki pogrom for inspiration.

	Oh btw, about the translation of the March. I tried to do it, but some terms don't have an adequate translation in Greek, namely the "euphoric" puns and things like "shilling". Should i coin some analogous phrases?
