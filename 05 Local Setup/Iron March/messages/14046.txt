	Ah.  College.  Noice.  I enjoyed college.  Arguing with teachers was best.  I went to Hobart College. Good fun! I have considered both Uni and Army.  Id love to study political science and philosophy,  but its not work spending the money. As for army, i am still undecided.  Weighing pros and cons. So i'm working to save at the moment.
