<p>I do understand that we have to face an anti-DPRK opposition, not to mention that fagcap is still there, instead of getting banned. We should slowly introduce the world our support for the DPRK, because we might be branded as "Nazis" "Human Rights Abusers" and "Communists", even though the DPRK is unique in her own soul, that she even rejects the Chinese or the Soviets. </p>
<p>Long live the DPRK, the Eternal president, the Eternal General Secretary, the Great Successor, and the Juche Idea! </p>
<p>This is not the end! </p>
<p>Long Live Traum Von Eisen! </p>
<p>If i ever go to the DPRK, i will thank them for saving their country, and as an inspiration for other nations enslaved by Liberalism/Capitalism/Communism!</p>
