	I like the "boundary" paragraph, I think its spot on. I didnt read your original post until now actually, this is one of the main things I'm having trouble with:

<p>
	" <span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial, 'sans-serif';">The laws of nature are all encompassing &amp; immutable when conscious control of external environment that fosters falsehoods ceases or unless organisms of differing species, breed or subspecies are not forced into the same territory by disasters, then Natural Law prevails.</span> "
</p>

<p>
	Since we exist within nature, and since natural laws are immutable, natural law never ceases to operate.
