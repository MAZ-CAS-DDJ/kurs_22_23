<p>thats the sort of attitude i like, not enough true enthusiasts anymore</p>
<p>no problem. you might be able to find some of them online as PDFs or cheap like used books. hmm, I remember theres one decent germanic pagan group, wodens brotherhood or something. ill  look them up for you</p>

<p>you come from a catholic background? i was raised protestant but turned catholic for a while before i became pagan so im familiar with most of it</p>
