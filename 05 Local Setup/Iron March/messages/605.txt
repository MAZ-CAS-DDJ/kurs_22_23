<p>Sorry for taking so long to get back with you.  I had some job training this weekend, so my correspondences were neglected a bit.  </p>
<p>Firstly, I am incredibly jealous you got to meet someone with a working knowledge of Icelandic!  I've always been interested in Icelandic, and about a year ago a got a bit serious about it and studied it before finals popped-up and I had to turn my attention elsewhere.  I was going to say "I recently tried to resume these studies, but the University of Iceland ended their free online classes."  However, I checked the site to make sure this is true, and it is not!  I have committed to studying Afrikaans with some friends, but I may just have to squeeze some Icelandic into my time!  Certainly I have gone on for too long about this.  Let's get to the message.</p>

<p>I think that when vikings came in Vinland, they always refered to their homeland or blood as identity.</p>
<p>I would prefer a identity based on the blood line, than the idea of actual mondialisation.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That is a good point.  "Western" is almost always a synonym for liberal: western values, western democracy, etc.  And I agree that nationalism needs to be built on blood and homeland.  People standing around saluting some imperial banner is paltry patriotism, and the collapse of Roman Empire showed us how strong those ties bind.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="202" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>I only discovered it a few days ago. It's not an idea from the francophonic culture.<p>I prefer socialism, not a state-socialism like in USSR but a national-collectivisation of means of production at the local level, in the factory or the quarter, the city or the local industry. It's more closer to the anarchistic vision of economy, and it's real that it's closer too with distributism.</p>
<p>Means of production wouldn't be between state or individual hands but for the community, it goes with an economy (production and consumption) focus on the local level, you would eat what the agriculture around you produced, and not what is imported from brazil, gabon or australia when the agriculture around you that produce the same thing is exportated anywhere.</p>
<p>Distributism seem to always be preferable than state-socialism or capitalism i agree, but there is no real interest outside a free market systeme (when decision of price and partners are decided by the community), or with a free market, it would quickly become again a capitalism way.</p>
<p>I don't believe in guilds too, because it would be the employer that decided all, and it will have a bad influence in the society between syndicats or old corporations. In a systeme where workers are free, why they would organise in group of interests ? To bicker themselves ?</p>
<p>The third Reich created the Labor Front, a single organic body for all workers, i think it is better. A middle between the old syndical way, the soviet way, and the fascist corporatist way.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on national anarchism?  I hadn't brought it up earlier because I thought you too state socialist, but I see that is not the case.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="202" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>But, and this is why I'm Fascist, I think these economic issues (who possess means of productions?) are secondary, the important thing is to have :<p>- A mimimum redistribution of wealth, from the 1% for example, in my country, they earn 20 times more than average income, and half from the interests, not their own work.</p>
<p>- An education to know better manage its business (it was the weakness of the Soviet, they did not know how to do)</p>
<p>- Nationalisation of banks and trusts</p>
<p>- Protectionism and sovereignty of the nation's economy, with companies such relocations, and fund locally.</p>
<p>- The end of speculation, the credits and  borrowing unprofitable for the society, and high rates of interests, thus ending the high finance.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Great policy!  And you are preaching to the choir when it comes to corrupt national elites.  As bad as you might have things in France I can assure you that your 1% is probably half as corrupt as America's 1%  One question, would communities be able to keep the profits from their businesses?</p>

<p>Thanks for that information.  Like I said, I am always interested in hearing about paganism.  In regards to the trifunctional hypothesis, is the casteless state of traders a result of a desire for economic autarky, veiled anti-Semitism, or something else altogether?  Otherwise, I must agree that this is the model society.  People had defined roles, but they weren't so oppressive as to push people into fatalism.  I'd also say that the only spiritual feelings I have are towards my family, my heimat, and (too a much more limited extent) the rituals of Catholicism.  The latter deeply conflicts me, as I despise Roman influences on the pure Germanic culture.   </p>

</div></blockquote>
<p>That is terribly unfortunate that your language has fallen into such disuse.  Is it in a state of revival comparable to its brothers Irish-Gaelic and Welsh?  Also, I tip my hat to your language prowess.  I am always embarrassed by the extent of monolingualism in America.   </p>

Local elections prove that if we ask for autonomy or independance, we have the same score. "half-nationalism" only exist as a compromise from colonisators, not for colonized people.  In the history, there is no declaration of autonomy but declaration of independance.<p>But now it won't be possible, not with the actual mondialisation, we see that Irland for example was a prey for the international finance, and to have a little state like cuba or north korea is not really suitable too, that's why i prefer the european level as a practice for a national-socialism way.</p>

<p>That is all very insightful.</p>

<p>That is correct.  More Americans descend from Germany than any other nation.  That being said, the Anglo-Saxons are at least a nominally Germanic people.  If they had the gumption to shake off their case of the Anglo Syndrome (finance capitalism and liberalism) and (when I am in a more fiery mood) the vestiges of the Norman Conquest they would make a fine people!  The same might be said about Americans, but it would be much harder for a national revolution to occur in the States.  Especially when one considers that American doesn't really have a genuine nationalism but merely flag-worshipping patriotism.</p>
<p>I stumbled across them once a few weeks ago and meant to check back with them.  Thanks for bringing them back to my attention! </p>

<p>I'll refrain from going into another "omg i luv iceland soo much" rant (let it be known that took considerable effort though, haha), and just express my general and intense curiosity about how this meeting went.</p>
<p>Hope the weekend treated you well!</p>
