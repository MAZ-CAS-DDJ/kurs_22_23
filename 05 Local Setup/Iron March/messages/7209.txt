<p>So I have finished readin the Hermetic Tradition last Friday, I decided to postpone writting my booklet until after my trip and initiation into the Jackboot Shamans, if the trip will take place, as I might face some difficulties on the matter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've begun reading "Introduction to Magic", a compilation of works by Evola and his Ur group, having read the Hermetic Tradition beforehand is already proving useful to understnading the context with perfect ease. I'm mentioning it now because I think this is the book to read for the Wolves unless they are already familiar with it as I'd say the Ur group can be said to have certain parallels in direction as what the Wolves are trying to do, so I thought you could mention that to them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'll get to work on translating your booklet soon as I figure some things out about my going to Europe as there may be a hindrance with that.</p>
