<p>Should've guessed from the profile pic. I think I might've had blinders on in regards to fascism in the governmental and political sense. I knew more of its economic policy. Shit. I never thought I'd see the day where I can go from leaning-libertarian Leftist to pondering on authoritarianism and Fascism.</p>
<p>It is also very true fascism has been reduced to a smear. I think George Orwell said something about that. Anyway. I'll send you a request on FB.</p>
