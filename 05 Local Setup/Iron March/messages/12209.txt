<p>Well, like I said this professor is definitely NOT one of us. He is a hardcore conservative and still believes in liberty, the individual, freedom, etc. I just thought it was kind of cool how he said he would not condemn me for my believes. Although, shortly after that he did try to encourage me to change my beliefs (something that is never going to happen) but I just listened politely because sometimes you have to know when to pick your battles.Â </p>
