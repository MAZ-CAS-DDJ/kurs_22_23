	Thanks for the info, I have noticed the medals before and it's good to see more and more of that symbol especially for it's from the original Bulgar times which we Magyars can relate to (they say that there is a good chance for the Dulo Dynasty was connected to Attila). By the way, can you explain the Bulgarian identity for me? I was already asking Misanthrope about that, but his reply was somewhat foggy. Do you see yourself as Slavs? I know that today's Bulgarians have a lot of Slavic blood, that's the same with us, but we still don't consider ourselves Slavs. And what about Macedonia? I read somewhere that the language they are using is almost the same as Bulgarian but Zmaj of course says that's bullshit and they are Serbs. :D
