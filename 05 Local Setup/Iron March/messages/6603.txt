<p>Well, I know about the book, but never had the chance to read it before.</p>
<p>As for the Han Chinese and the nomads, I think I can understand why the author can appreciate the free-spirit of the nomads, but we do not revere the wolf merely for its ferocity and strength. We believe the wolf to be sacred due to the fact that both us Turks and Mongols believe that the Sky God Tengri, has come to the world in the shape of a wolf, and mated with man, and gave birth to our people. We believe that the wolf is our direct ancestor, and therefore we have claimed it as our totem animal, and the representation of our national soul.</p>

<p>The Han Chinese too, had worshipped heaven, as they considered their emperors to be the sons of heaven. Their sedentary and sheepish livestyles also merit some credit. Whereas we have dispersed our kind across a large area, the Han Chinese have managed to maintain a definite presence in a single area, and although they were a lot less expansionistic, they had a lot more time to develop their civilisation, whereas we required "templates" in order to build one.</p>
<p>As you see, both worldviews have their respective advantages and disadvantages.</p>
