	Hiking,sparring,cycling,exercise without equipment like push ups,sit ups and pull ups and exercise with equipment are basic things. Other activities could be what the Florida Chapter of Atomwaffen really likes to do, urban exploration (urbex), something that is really fun,engaging and requires a lot of group cohesion. Odin (the leader of Atomwaffen currently at basic) wrote a good article about <a href="http://ropeculture.org/2016/02/11/urban-exploring/" rel="external nofollow">Urbex on Noose. </a> There's also an Iron March <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/forum/162-urban-exploration-club/" rel="">Urbex</a> subforum, would be great if we could get more activity on there haha.
