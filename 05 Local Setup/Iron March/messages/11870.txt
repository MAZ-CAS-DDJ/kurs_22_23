<p>Hey man, I'm Thulean Pleb from Fash Britannia via The Right Stuff. We've set up a fashy skype for The Right Stuff type people. I've been reading the forum for a good while now. I know your opinions on The Right Stuff, through public threads at least. If you or some friendly goys would like to add anything to the discussions, that would be cool. I myself and a few others are quite fond of your lot. Your voice would add a lot to the British side of it all. </p>
<p>Just a suggestion, mate. Happy new year!</p>
