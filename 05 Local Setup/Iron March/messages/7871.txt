<p>Well, HEPAR was mostly seen as the party of the more ideologically purist Turkish nationalists, but now people that have traditionally voted for the CHP are flocking here as well. It might be just due to the fact that MHP is seen as too "religious", though the MHP is no less secular than HEPAR. Its just that it includes religion as a means to connect with its voters.</p>
<p>HEPAR on the other hand is a relatively new party. It needs to get voters from somewhere, and it primarily chooses CHP voters who are nationalistic, but are skeptical about the MHP due to the friction that existed between the two parties prior to the 80ies.</p>
<p>As for liberalism, HEPAR is by no means liberal, and cannot accomodate any of the cosmopolitan crap that exists in CHP due to the high number of Turkist supporters, they might not be too religious, but they are quite the traditionalists, and are opposed to cosmopolitan influence.</p>
