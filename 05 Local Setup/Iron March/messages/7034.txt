Nicholas Cage needs to start playing more of his old type of roles too, he's got a lot of good films. I liked 300 besides the anti-Persian bias in it but you can't really expect too much for a film of that era. The only films I watch now really are Nick Love films like Rise of the footsoldier, bonded by blood and Kill List (not sure if this is Nick Love or not). The essex boys Patrick Tate and Terry Stone who were portrayed in ROTFS and bonded by blood are pretty much anti-heroes in this country, the myths and rumours and personal anecdotes (bullshit or not) are amusing, it's the same with former boxer Paul Sykes and any other well known figures and families anywhere in this country, it's all part of the natural order. Everybody likes somebody who's a bit of a criminal, depending on what they do. It annoys me to see people kiss the mafiosos asses (whatever the country) <a href="http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig11/russell-t2.1.1.html" rel="external nofollow">when they are the biggest promoters of faggotry - gay bars and miscegenation.</a> I think what's more sickening and telling is that Libertarians think this is good stuff and should earn the mafia respect. I respect a gang of pickpockets more. The only respectable thing about the Russian/Israeli mafia IMO is their distribution of ecstasy.</p>

The 80s were too soft, the 70s didn't do enough to help themselves when they had carte blanche to do so and the 60s and 50s fucked it for everyone. I think most people living through the 90s have a desire to go back there, otherwise the best of 90s music cds and the 90s ministry of sound mash up CDs wouldn't sell so well nor would the TV shows of the 90s be the most viewed vids on youtube.</p>
