<p>Well, 'economic pragmatism' would be a more fitting term, but overall I am a State Socialist. Nationalize all the important industries, Corporatize or Syndicalize here and there. Certain things can be private. Some State regulations in place for the private ones and you're good to go.</p>
<p>And why Stratocracy? I have a large amount of respect for the Armed Forces and find it to be the organization which would be the most capable to become the State. It brings order and discipline. An Administrative 'branch' could be made which forms the Government.</p>
<p>I'd also entrech the Armed Forces into school, making it a mandatory course through-out school. Military service optional at adult-hood, but if you don't serve, you loose an amount of your privileges(i.e.: You cannot participate in any political process.)</p>
<p>The police would be replaced with military police, military check-points on roads and highways.The military conducting patrols and responding to things.</p>
<p>I'd also add a ceiling of sorts. After 6 or 8 years of service, you're granted access to a higher 'class' that would simply be a citizen with political access, more privileges, etc. I'd have a separate class for those who serve, say, 15-20 years or until retirement, a 'warrior' class.</p>
