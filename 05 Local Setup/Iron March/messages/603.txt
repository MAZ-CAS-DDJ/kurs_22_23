<p>I can recommend a book:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship</span>, by A. James Gregor. It traces the development of fascist ideology from Marxist syndicalism through to corporatism. I really cannnot recommend the book highly enough, it contains bucket-loads of information about the roots of fascism and the syndicalist nature of fascist ideology and economics. For an academic text it is also surprisingly neutral- it doesn't seek to judge fascism at all, merely to explain it.</p>
<p>What is a 'National Trotskyist', btw?</p>
