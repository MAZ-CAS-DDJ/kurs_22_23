	Sagas have some rituals / practices in them but not really written in a way as to be a guide on how to worship or anything. Varg's books and blog are a good source for rituals and worship, especially for specific events like yule or equinoxes. They're generally not things you can participate in these days, as you need a group to do it. They were sword dances and various other festivities. The way we celebrate Christmas to this day is not too different to how they did it, same as new years, minus the typical hedonistic boozing people do.
