<p>We actually did get 11, but yeah I meant we bagged out by 11am, the fish were about 15-20kg. Not commercial, because it's a semi-endangered fish you can only fish them recreationally. Apparently it's a 70k fine per fish if you sell them.</p>

<p>It's two fish each so me and my dad take four home, and the other blokes take home there share. We put the tuna in oil with salt and peppercorn, and just take it out when you want some, lasts for months, until we go next year. I think we have a deer hunt planned for June or July, so may have some venison as well. </p>
