<p>Ah, Nordisk Ungdom, guess I kinda messed up in remembering the name of the NU. hahaha. I am luckily aware of what the NU stands for. But, I thank you for the links, so I can educate myself more on your movement. </p>
<p>Joining the SvP sounds like a brilliant idea. Parties like the SvP is the essence of modern Ethnic nationalism, a form of nationalism, that will stop the internal decay of our nations. </p>
<p>SMR, like many other orthodox NS movements, tend to do more damage to the nationalist cause, rather than benefit. Trust me, as a old DNSB member, I know how static Orthodox NS can be. The support in public of these Orthodox ns groups, are minimal, due to historical indoctrinatio and propaganda. One can never archive power with rhetoric, that doesn't catch the appeal of the public.</p>
<p>I am a proud member of Danskernes Parti, a sister party to the SvP.</p>
