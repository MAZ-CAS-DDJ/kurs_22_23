<p>I'll agree to that. I can't stand the people who look back to the 50s as a glorious time - I was once guilty of doing this once I came to the "traditionalist" stuff and realised it wasn't sincere when I was going out on the piss most weekends having a laugh and winding up coppers; the 50s stands for everything which saw the defeat and suppression of fascism and began the gradual tone for the disgusting 60s.</p>

<p>If they did but know it futurism is a much better reflection of fascist attitude than traditionalism. Who gives a fuck about conservatism and trying failed ideas again just because they're traditional? I like trolling 'traditionalists' by pretending to be a pederast; after all it is a widely practiced 'tradition.'</p>
<p>I've heard of a couple of the NS bands you post in the musical section. It's a shame to see so many skins and American WN just latching onto crappy NS black metal or overplayed skrewdriver songs.</p>
<p>House music is the best music it's like the yin to a yang for fascists, I don't really know how to describe it, it's relaxing, smooth and upbeat at the same time, it's got a youthful and nostalgic vibe to it as well while it can add a new variety to it. It's very complimentary to a successful fascist philosophy in general. I'd like to study music much more as I think it's a vital tool that only a few have touched on and many have done it unsuccessfully - it's an area where fascism has failed to apply the technique where as anti-fa have applied the concept well for their ends. Boyd Rice is one of the few successful musicians to reach a wider audience with his P-incorrect ideas.</p>
