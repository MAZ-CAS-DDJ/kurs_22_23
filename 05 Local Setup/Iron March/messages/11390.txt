<p>well the government can clearly see that your just a poor multiracial goy in need of shekels. For life or does it run out ?</p>

<p>Same I thought about getting an agriculture course and starting a farm out in the middle of nowhere. I'm doing History at college and like some of my posts in Trivial happenings I explained that getting a Phd is ridiculous and I am not sure I wanted to be a professor anymore.</p>

<p>It's also nice to talk to someone that also has no idea of what to do , my two friends here are both depressed working minimum wage jobs at warehouses and a factory.</p>

<p>when you said "I just want to live" those are my exact feelings I just want to live I don't want to worry about a career working for some business that is unimportant, the problem is you need money to own a house and get food.</p>
