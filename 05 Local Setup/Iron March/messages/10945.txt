<p>Yes, I think that the state should promote Fascism as a religion in and of itself. However, in states where religious institutions are already well established; the state (in my opinion) should encourage them to promote Fascism instead of doing away with said religious institutions. Anyways, I noticed that you haven't really been posting to the forum. Not that I dislike these chats or anything, but you can find the answers to some of your questions within the different forum threads. As I have said before these are just myÂ <strong>personal</strong> opinions, and they may differ slightly or a lot with the opinions of other members of this forum. My point is that you should try exploring this forum more and get the opinions of others as well. You can also throw in your own opinions too. All that being said I am happy to answer your questions but, I think you should get out on the forum more if you really want to learn as well.</p>
