<p>You inquired on a post I made a while ago abou why I wish to leave this forum. </p>
<p>The reason I want to leave this site is, for one, the users seem to be apalling. They seem to have some strange knee jerk reaction against homosexuals, and the same goes for autistic people. It's like a stereotype of what a liberal thinks a fascist actually believes. Both are traits I'd expect from the brain dead neo-nazi types that infest american prisons. They're what I like to call "white niggers". It's odd how they subscribe to an ideology that is about being noble and aryan, and yet they behave like the blackskins they so wholeheartily despise.</p>
<p>People on this forum take themselves all too seriously. They're "facebook revolutionaries". they're people on the internet. They should at least be humble and lighten up. </p>
<p>Also, this forum seems to be filled with people I like to call "meat heads". They're like extroverts who hate introverts, basically. They are kinda like niggers who measure their status in gold chains and how many men they've impregnated. Which is also why every disagreement turns into an insult contest. </p>
<p>Second of all, I have changed my political views. I have become disillusioned with the notion of a pure, wonderful state that will bring about a spiritual awakening among the European peoples. That beautiful machine of blood and iron that will give the children and the common people a religion that will make their hearts sing to the glory of civilization is a lie. Good statesman are few and far between, yet alone the angels that fascists desire to control everything from churches to baseball leagues. This is likely a result of governors either coming from the military or from the bourgeoisie. Not to mention the extreme hybris of every authoritarian. They all more or less envision themselves, or someone of their same beliefs, to be in power. Marxists typically use the same logic to justify their authoritarianism over democracy(inb4 ultra butthurt). </p>
