<p>Fuck me, SubRosa looks impressive. It uses lots of encryption features which are top notch. It's literally what I would design and want from an email client.</p>
<p>However, reading a detail by the company is going to be glowing. I looked up EFF's review and they had this to say:</p>
<p>"Six applications, most of them open source, met all of the EFF's requirements: CryptoCat, a Web-based instant messaging application; ChatSecure, an encrypted chat client for iPhone and Android; TextSecure, a text messaging app for Android; RedPhone, an encrypted calling app for Android and Signal, its version for iOS; Silent Text and Silent Phone, the encrypted texting and calling apps by secure communications provider Silent Circle.</p>
<p>There were other apps that came close, failing on just one criteria -- the annual code audit or the forward secrecy requirements. These products were Mailvelope, RetroShare, Subrosa, Jitsi, Adium and Pidgin."</p>
<p>Not the worst of failures. My only issue is SubRosa claims to be based outside the EU, as if that's a good call to vent against EU law infringement. But what if it was based in US...or Israel?</p>
<p>I'll continue to look into it and let you know. Thanks for bringing this to my attention.</p>
<p>On a further nor, SubRosa has .io as it's domain. I looked this up and it trails to the British Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>"Located in the Indian Ocean, the British Indian Ocean Territory is an archipelago south of India, about halfway between Africa and Indonesia. This area includes the entire Chagos Archipelago of 55 islands. The combined area of these islands is 21,004 square miles, about one third the size of Washington D.C. Currently there are no indigenous habitats on these islands. In the 1960's and 70's, approximately 1,200 former agricultural workers in the Chagos Archipelago were relocated to Mauritius and the Seychelles. In November 2000 they were granted the right of return by a British High Court ruling. However, this ruling was overturned in 2008, finding no right for the natives to return. By November 2004, approximately 4,000 United Kingdom and United States military personnel and civilian contractors were living on the island of Diego Garcia in a joint naval support facility."</p>
<p>So wherever these servers are, they are based in an area where the inhabitants are US and UK !military and affiliated contractors? Hence the 'no EU ruling laws' is quite a hollow claim. This worries me but I'll continue to look.</p>
