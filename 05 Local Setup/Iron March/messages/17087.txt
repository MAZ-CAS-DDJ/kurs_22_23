	So basically you want to exterminate your literal brothers because they are under the effect of a nationwide illusion? :D You can't win a debate unless you have an opponent. Serbia had a historical chance from 1918 to 1941 and from 1945 to 1991, and hence all of the difficulties of that time you always have to be ready to question the actions of your own people. It's always easier to blame others, that's why I like how Nikolajević constantly stresses the importance of responsibility.

	Back then when I was one of the mainstream Hungarian Chauvinists I was calling the Romanians Gypsies, the Serbs animals and I was referring to the Slovaks similarly as you refer to the Croats; I was laughing about the concept of their nation - and in a way it was much more easier for me, because independent Slovakia was born only in 1993. Our Chauvinists are even having a motto which says <a href="http://m.cdn.blog.hu/po/polir/image/idosebb_mint_szlovakia.jpg" rel="external nofollow">"I am older than Slovakia"</a>. Now take a look at <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eECDrrYY_OA/T9edKtQBZSI/AAAAAAAAA7g/MLd0wHboErI/s1600/szlovakia-tortenete.jpg" rel="external nofollow">this design</a>, printed in 2009. It says:

	"The real history of Slovakia. Age: 16 years. Number of kings: 0. Number of warlords: 0. Number of victories in battle: 0. Area: robbed. Coat of Arms: stolen."
</p>

	That's a way to see it, but I have realized that it's just simply wrong. Maybe the name of Slovakia is new, but the people lived there for hundreds of years were calling themselves Slovaks long before the creation of their state. They were also a part of our kingdom, thus we share the same kings and symbols. We also had a lot of great Hungarians of Slovak origin; "Tóth", the old name we used for Slovaks is the third in the list of the most common Hungarian names. Of course they have their own Chauvinism just like us, but it was our fault that we didn't gave a shit about their existence until it was too late. You know, they were even having the supranational "Hungarus" identity (similar to the "Yugoslavian" one) from the Middle Ages, what was for most of them more important that their national one. We were still able to fuck this whole thing up for ourselves. Today I see them as brothers since we lived under the same crown for hundreds of years. From this perspective it becomes clear that their Coat of Arms is not stolen, but one of the proofs of the historical bond between us. I wasn't able to see them as enemies anymore. In fact, the Chauvinistic hatred between us became a bad joke in my eyes, something what you can't take serious anymore, like the petty quarrels between siblings.

	That's the best way to change a man's mind about them. :D

	Seriously, take a look into the Croatian side of the story. You never know what you can find.
