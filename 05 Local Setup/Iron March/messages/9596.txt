<p>I suppose it is a matter of finding something you love doing, and becoming self-sufficient off of that. You have done quite well in that regard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I think I could make it as a mainstream designer and fund my life and fascist activities that way, if I make sure to conceal my political graphics from my IRL identity. Maybe that ship has sailed already.</p>
<p>Or I could not be a sell-out and start something like White Rex, that sounds much better.</p>

<p>I'm really happy for you. There is nothing better to me than a new frontier and we both have one. Onwards!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don't spend much time around babies but these descriptions you give have infected me with daddy feels. It is a good feeling to know there is truly something worth fighting for and living for!</p>

<p>Beyond ideals, beyond politics, we have our progeny and the love they come from.</p>
<p>That's all we really pass on after death, the rest is just a reflection of the way others see us.</p>
