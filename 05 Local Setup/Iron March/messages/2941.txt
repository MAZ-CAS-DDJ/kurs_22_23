<p>Agostino Lanzillo: The cleansing of War</p>
<p>Agostino Lanzillo (1886-1952) was born and raised in Italy and was a disciple of Sorel and Pareta. The writings from his hand hold an individual interpretation of Sorelian syndicalism and Paretian elitarism. He was active as a reporter in the revolutionary syndicalist movement and joined Mussolini as a staff member at Popolo d'Italia. His works are still relevant in the context of the current crisis and at the eve of a new great revolutionary social transformation.        </p>
<p>"It appeared that the capitalist classes with their extended and complex network of interests that united them could prevent the war (WO I). Consequently one thought the international proletariat confronted with the treat of unlimited war would make a revolutionary move. But once the war truly broke out it was found that the socialist predictions where completely wrong: there formed no revolutionary opposition and the hostilities began with the full and unlimited support of the whole nation. </p>
<p>This was the moment of the crisis (of socialism): a whole line of thought and ideas was erased; the historic and ideological structure of socialism, that dominated the 19th and first half of the 20th century, collapsed and practice took another direction in contrast to socialist theory. </p>
<p>In her general conception socialism was founded on class differences and the political evaluation of these differences: the war has left classes behind and gave the nation back its spirit of national unity. Socialism bases her argumentation only on the diametrical opposition of interests within individual nations and the war proved that it was possible to unite these interests in the will to defend a common heritage and common ideals with force. Such a hard fought conflict between peoples and nations cannot be explained without a recognition of an internal agreement within these people; the full support of all classes, so also of the working classes.         </p>
<p>The capitalist society has rapidly left the scientific approach she was founded on behind and her whole organization is fundamentally transformed. Her economic, juridical and political structures are changed. Her Laissez-Faire economic principles are rejected by her practice, which led to the collapse of the spirit of conquest that inspired capitalism for a very short but intense time. From that time on (the French revolution) the bourgeoisie degenerated.    </p>
<p>Her creative spirit was broken. Pacifism must be seen as the most characterizing symptom of this second phase of society. Pacifism is the result of the tendency to find a equilibrium (balance); the necessity to conserve, to come to a stand still (reactionary conservatism). Pacifism is the most authenticable manifestation of a social lack of revolutionary spirit. The capitalist society reacts pacifist to provide a counterweight against the pressure of class struggle as well as against the pressure from historical, economical and social conflicts between nations.      </p>
<p>The tendency towards pacifism dominated each European nation of the 19th century. In almost all these nations the nationalist movements where minority fractions. We must not forget that the nationalist movement is very recent. These arose around 1900 in France and around 1908 in Italy. To make a long story short: this is a symptom of the opening of a new historical horizon. It’s no coincidence that the nationalist and syndicalist movements arose simultaneously.  </p>
<p>With this double reaction the world crisis began. The resurrection of nationalist ideologies and the outspoken change of attitude of the workers movement brought by syndicalism, represents a tendency towards reforms of great interest. The optimist, pacifist and reformist democratic processes where already too far advanced to be stopped by these tendencies, no matter if they were founded on the creation of a new bourgeoisie, imperialist ideas or a renewed spirit of proletarian class struggle. The decadence of society was to far advanced and became too complex to be stopped by normal means and by minority movements.   </p>
<p>War is a reaction on degeneration. War is prove that society cannot collapse because it knows something indefinable, that pops up like a new outgrowth on a old rotting tree. It acknowledges the unlimited quality of Life.   </p>
<p>When it seemed that society would crystallize in a solid shape, when the powers of rationalism and intellectualism seemed to prevail to close the historical cycles of capitalism in strict and rigid forms, from a thunderstorm broke out a comprehensive war between nations. Ideas, systems and institutions collapsed. The economy became transformed and all that once looked stable was destroyed. Revolution broke out. This revolution was the result of a century of events, because it forced a solution for certain historical, ethical, social and psychological problems.   </p>
<p>Like the finale of a Beethoven symphony, this war took on all major themes that exist in a historical schematic and which remained unsolved. It’s the crisis of crisis, the conclusion of each event that they have left waiting. This war has the biggest connection with the great (French) revolution. Each of us feels instinctively that this moment, this epilogue of this great tragedy that is fought on battlefields, will bring us great, radical and unpredictable transformation tomorrow. It’s a universal war that is founded in the deepest, most divers and essential activities of spirit.    </p>
<p>The most important reason for the defeat of socialism is that she fell for the optimist ideas of democracy. We can see that the truth of syndicalism lies in her long opposition against democratic optimism and against socialist materialism. Her force lies in the eternal interest in developing proletarian consciousness that despises the sick and corrupt mentality of the bourgeoisie.  </p>
<p>The antiparliamentary struggle of syndicalists in Italy and France is the most glorious manifestation of syndicalist activity and stands at the cradle of a new post war future. None of the syndicalist critics is better founded then their rejection to acknowledge the legitimacy of the strict electoral mentality of the bourgeois and socialist parties. The modern society confronted with the danger of the war is visually transformed and adopts the psychological attitude that meets the demands of this time. So we will witness the formation of a new ideology that adapts to the historical situation and the requirements of a new civilization."  </p>
