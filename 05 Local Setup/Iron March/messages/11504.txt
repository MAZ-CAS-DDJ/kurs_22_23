<p>Alright, sorry if this goes off on a tangent, just need to give you some background.  I'm Catholic, always considered myself to be pretty pious, went to Catholic school since I was 13.  My mom used to be Protestant and because of that and constant school teachings, I pretty much am completely turned off from Protestantism.  But, we were never really taught why the Catholic Church was the TRUE Church and has Apostolic Tradition instead of the Orthodox.  I went to divine liturgy in August and ever since then I've gotten increasingly drawn to it.  My question is, what is the Orthodox Churches stance on the pope, and why you consider your Church to be the True one?</p>
