<p>Ha that's interesting, hmm since I transferred schools, so about a month or so ago. But ive lurked on here for quite awhile. From time to time there are great threads and things you can discuss and learn. But since there are so many varying views and races on here adding to the fact that many people are still very young makes it hard sometimes, but its great to be able to be open and honest on here and have a good laugh.</p>
<p>I'm a supporter of National Socialism but am realistic in thinking it well never happen here, but I've been this way since I was 16, still learning more everyday. I've done a lot and seen even more. If you ever have questions about what it's like with people like this in real life I'm your guy to ask ive stayed with fascists of casa pound in Belgium, and NS in Germany. My interest stemmed from playing call of duty 2 believe it or not. How about you what led you to consider fascism?</p>
