<p>Hey, so I know a couple relatively wealthy conservatives. They are not typically very interested in politics, but its possible they could donate quite a bit of money or the cause, and one of the ideas that we are looking at is a nationalist enclave in the American Northwest. First of all I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. Second, I'm really excited about this idea. You can buy a LOT of land in the American states of Montana and Washington for relatively cheap and have almost complete privacy.</p>
