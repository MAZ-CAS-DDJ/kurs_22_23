<p>I know where MP lives.<br />You do have a point, I've no idea why I didn't make that connection because when I went with him, Heimbach, Buhls, and MP's daughter to Tennessee Parrott always wanted fast food. When we all had dinner at Buhl's house some weeks later, MP didn't want to eat with us because in his words, "I'm half autistic and only like food in a pre-wrapped, yellow package." You are right, he should be getting paid because he always moaned how he never had money to pay his rent and how his free-lance programming wasn't taking off. He's apparently gotten a job since then but who knows?</p>

<p>To be honest, I don't think he is actually mentally ill. Autistic? Perhaps, but it mostly boils down to his massive ego. He'll talk to any group despite their history for informants. NSM is the biggest example. He always goes to the lowest of the low and I've honestly no idea why so many people are buying into his shit. All I can figure is that everyone is so desperate for a re-packaged Proud White Man shtick that they would have taken anyone. MP just so happened to be the first to step up. Am I an Orthodox Christian? Of course! And I will be till the very day I die. But you cannot build an Orthodox movement in America that is directed at the general populace, and there are so many in the Church who won't take him seriously because all he is doing is cosplaying with an Icon and dragging the name of the Church through the mud.<br /><br />I wish I had never gotten involved with TY in the first place, but we all make mistakes.<br />Sorry for the rant.<br /> </p>
<p>Yes, I've come to think the Far-Right in America needs to start learning from the far-left and I'm not saying that because I'm an embittered National Syndicalist but because the Left has rooted themselves so deeply in Murika it's not even funny.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> </p>
