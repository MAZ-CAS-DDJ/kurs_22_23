	Depends on who the prayer is for. You'll want to choose an item associated with that god / goddess. Fruit, grains, meat or even flowers can be used. It's especially good if it's your own home grown fruits and you give the first harvest to them. I don't use meat as that would require sacrificing an animal at the altar, and then eating it in a communal feast. I might be a bit soft but I don't fancy the idea of killing livestock.
