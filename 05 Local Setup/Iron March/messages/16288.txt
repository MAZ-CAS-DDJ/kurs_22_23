	Depends. I can't despise a folk for keeping true to itself, and therefore I don't even deem it morally wrong if they want to kill every last Croat and clear up the land for their children.

	But the insolence of their likes, claiming that they're the absolute authority able to estimate the proper character of a nation is pure mental gymnastics. Let's put it simple;Jews and nonwhites are not humans, but as for the whites, respect their fucking nations even if you want to clear them off the face of this earth.

	Furthermore, they might create a fruitful ground for a non-Croat instigated Jasenovac, and then they'll cry again to the world about being victims. Fuck that idiocy. They can't understand the simplest of rules...
