			Thanks for the concise reply.

			Sounds ideal and very interesting. I do, however, have more basic questions.
		</p>

		<ul><li>
				How does one go about engaging with the group or its members?
			</li>
			<li>
				What commitments does membership entail?
			</li>
			<li>
				As this is a pan-European group, what are its goals exactly? Is it basically nationalist organisation active <em>within </em>nations, but also with supporting links <em>between </em>nations? 
			</li>
		</ul><p>
			Thanks from England.

	Currently, we constitute only a Telegram group, so you don't have to worry about all those matters. You can leave and rejoin whenever you want to, and there obviously isn't any kind of membership at all. It is free.

	Yes, the group is Pan-European and International. It is also a new community, so we are now immersed in the growing phase of every community.
