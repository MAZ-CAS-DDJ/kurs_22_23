<p>Alright, I will definitely be willing to help write for you and be a member of an organization and do some work towards a goal. That sounds good. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'd gladly write a lot for the organization because there is a lot of risque writing that I cannot do with my real name for the time being. Obviously, at some point I want to do it with my real name, but now is not that time. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As far as writing about cultural Marxism, just google some stuff on Antonio Gramsci. He is a good place to start as he theorized very much that the Marxist should infiltrate all institutions and transmit the cultural values to make way for the Marxist revolution. </p>
