	Of course they do, you just have to force them. You couldn't possibly think that everybody fighting against your enemies were heroes; most of the soldiers were always fighting because of necessity, not for greater ideals. We have great heroes and we have to respect them, but over-idealizing our history is just as false as devaluating it.

			Yet both of us know Hungarian kingdom was largely multi-ethnic kingdom. Serbia wasn't. It became one when it became Empire, having large number of Bulgarians and Greeks in it. Also, all ethnic maps I ever saw of A-H empire include different ethnicities. Not all were Hungarians?

	Every one of those maps are from the XIX-XX. century. Ethnicity before that simply wasn't that important.

	What I am talking about here is partly ethnogenesis and partly the modern concept of the nation. Yes, the Hungarian Kingdom was largely multi-ethnic, but with a supranational identity - so were France, Germany, Italy, etc., all with different regional identities and ethnic influences, only their actions were more aggressive to unify every community into their artificial nation states. The French Chauvinists for example banned every regional language and forced French identity to every <em>citizen</em> (another Modernist concept), while even before Trianon there were more Romanian schools in Transylvania then in the Regat. The Habsburgs of course first tried to Germanize the whole empire, and we have answered with forced Hungarianization unfortunately. It' easy to be clever after the fact, but back then this has divided the Empire and Austrians and Hungarians gone into a war of identity, in which we tried to follow a softer version of the French model while the Austrians were supporting our minorities. Then came WW1 and of course the primary object of the West was the same as today: divide and rule. It's funny how they argued for the right of the peoples for establishing independent nation states here, while back in their countries they were fully against the very same concept. This is the same game the Jews are playing; they are supporting every kind of Liberalism everywhere except in Israel, where they are arguing for hardcore Nationalism/Chauvinism and sometimes even Racism. Or just look at the example of Kosovo and Crimea. Same situation, totally different Western propaganda.

	All in all, though it's true that most of your neighbors are Slavic and Orthodox, but they can still have a different identity than Serbian - after all, we could call every Orthodox Slav a Russian on the same basis. The problem is not with regional identities (it is natural that a Serb from Vojvodina is different than a Serb from Bosnia), but the confusion of the hierarchy of identities. Everything can be disintegrated into even smaller pieces, for a man is more closer to his family than to others, to his city than to other cities, to his region than to other regions and so on. What is unnatural is when his false pride becomes supported by faraway powers, and transforms his love for his own into hate towards his neighbor (see Ukraine). This rips out these regions from their traditional place thus tearing apart the organic structures.

<p>
	I see your hate towards Croatians as the same hatred.

			We, as Slavs, settled in the lands of Roman provinces, no? Provinces populated by lesser tribes we assimilated (such as Illyrian tribes) and other largely empty. It's not like this region was densely populated before we settled and established our states.

	I see. I though you meant something more... formal. :D

<p>
	The same applies to old Hungary though. When we came here, we were the absolute majority, our numbers only dropped later with the invasion of the Mongols and the Ottomans.
