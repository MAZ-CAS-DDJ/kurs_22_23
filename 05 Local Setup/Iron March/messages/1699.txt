<p>Yeah I can totally understand your take on things. My deal is I've been to Europe plenty when I was a kid (luckily had travel-oriented parents, and spent plenty of time in France on student exchange) so I've seen Germany, Italy, Spain, Holland, Switzerland, the UK... most of Western Europe really. I'd love to go again as an adult, but being an Australian and being so close to Asia (which is fucking cheap as chips mind) means it's a pretty convenient travel destination. Plus, Australia is (geographically, if not in any other way) part of Asia, meaning we can't really afford to ignore the rest of the region. It's a pretty interesting place, and pretty important for our country in tons of ways, even if they do seem to have an arse-backwards approach to life. For instance, I doubt you'd see people shitting in a major river in any part of Europe... or people brushing their teeth a few hundred metres down, in the same damn river. Though as you mentioned, Singapore is great. Wonderfully clean city-state, plus they have public corporal punishment for deadbeats (and the death penalty for drug offences, something I'm sure you'll approve of <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" />).</p>
<p>Your trip sounds like a good idea though. Europe should be first port of call for any of us... I'll probably tackle that next. Money permitting. XD</p>
<p>And yeah, still up for the article. Let me know when you need it written. If it's only one page I don't think it'll be a problem at all, even when university is at its busiest.</p>
