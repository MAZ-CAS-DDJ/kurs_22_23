	Usually I quote Codreanu on Monarchy when it comes to Protestantism: <em>"Not all monarchs have been good. Monarchy, however, has always been good."</em> Yes, Protestants had <em>some</em> good intentions, but they ended up destroying the Church instead of fixing its problems, and we can see the result of this today. The only situation in which I would welcome the fall of the Church is if we would have something better to replace it with. Historical Fascism could have been that.

	Sadly people in Hungary are turning away from Catholicism, mostly because we (just like the rest of the world) are losing our connection with religion. I am trying to research the great Traditions but I don't think I will ever going to pick one for myself. If I remember correctly, there was a debate between Evola and Gu√©non about this, and Evola argued that sticking to a concrete religious form is not necessary in order to find out the Truth. To my understanding every religion is in decline, and it was natural that in an era like this extraordinary men will come and save what is left of them by reformulating their essence. Traditions are all talking about the same thing, but they naturally aren't saying the same. I see this as a result of our different viewpoints as humans, peoples, nations etc.:

	You can also look up the Hindu story of the blind men and the elephant for an even more clear explanation.

	For this I am trying to grasp the essence behind religions mainly through reading the great Mystics. I was also following Vikernes and translating some of his stuff until I have realized that he is basically an Agnostic/Utilitarian and the only thing why he sees Paganism as good is because those<em> tales</em> are building up some good morals what can prevent humans from destroying nature. Now I am not against nature but I never understood why would any mortal be obsessed with it. If we are to perish than we should pursue higher realities. MEMENTO MORI.

	Science is neutral in general, but since it is out of control it became the tool in the hands of destructive forces. I see today's Scientism similar to Polytheism, where the form became more important than the content. Praying to the Creator of natural forces through their personifications is totally OK, but praying to the forces themselves is idiotic, especially if in time this practice turns against exactly their Source (that's how science became Atheistic, though I can see its other side too). Science should have been coordinated by philosophers in the Platonian sense.

	You are right in that Paganism is not a perfect word for that we are using it for, but 'Ancient religions' is inaccurate too since most of those weren't institutionalized systems but mysteries (which system was more closer to the Fascist Corporatism, but needs a much stronger society in order to survive). Usually I use the terms Paganism and Heathenism while I call their degenerated forms neo-Paganism.

	I was never interested in the religious history cause it's extremely hard for me to believe anything from most of the sources, especially in this age where movies like 'The Secret' or 'Zeitgeist' can convince millions about falsehoods.
