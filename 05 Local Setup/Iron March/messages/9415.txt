<p>I'm glad it wasn't, but also glad I explained my thoughts on that. Respect has always been a big part of my idealism, and I can't stand this notion of tension, competition, or conflict between man and woman. We're meant to complement each other, not fight over the scraps at the table.</p>

<p>That's fucking horrid, such monsters should be culled with a shot to the back of the head. I won't pretend I haven't entertained killing people, but that... It's not barbarism, it's just something so utterly alien to me. The dangers of pleasure. I would end that man's (does he deserve the name?) life in a second and feel no remorse. I'm glad I quit masturbation a while ago, it's a nasty habit in general but now I will always associate it with that gruesome imagery...
