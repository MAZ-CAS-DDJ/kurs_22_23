<p>I'd of thought you'd be unwelcome here due to all the white supremacists (unless you actually believe you are an inferior race which seems counterproductive). Surely, if you don't mind my fowardness, it is... strange, in a sense, to promote Nazism despite the fact Nazism in all its strains normally advocates racial purity, and you would considered racially "impure" (having hispanic, african and asian roots all at once). Don't get me wrong, I'm not against you, but it seems Nazism would be. Could you give me some insight into this issue?</p>
<p>Sorry if I'm sounding like an asshole, but I'm just trying to get an idea of how you could incorporate a fascist worldview despite being of mixed race background.</p>
</div></blockquote>Well you only think like this because you don't have a very good understanding of Fascism yet.  <p>There are actually a number of non-white and mixed race users here.  The Administer and owner of this website is actually half white and half mongol/Asian. That's not to say we support race mixing, we just accept that it is an unfortunate fact of the modern world.  None us here support race mixing and we would all outlaw it, the fact that some of us maybe mixed ourselves doesn't matter at all. We want to stop the race mixing and make sure that it goes no further than what it already has.  What is wrong with believing that my race is inferior to the more pure European races?  There is nothing counterproductive about it at all actually. </p>
<p>Personal interests play no part in Fascism.  Fascism is truth and we accept truth no matter how it affects us personally.  I will not deny reality just because it may be inconvenient for my personal situation, and this is what it means to be fascist.  So I gladly accept that race mixing is wrong even though I'm mixed myself; I also gladly accept  that the European races are superior to all others even though I do not belong to those races.  I accept what is true and deny what is false, I can't let my personal interest get in the way because then I'd be dishonest. Being a Fascist doesn't mean that we have to hate racially mixed people just because they are racially mixed, just like it doesn't mean that you automatically have to hate every other race besides your own. </p>
<p>The modern world is about rejecting reality in order to feel good and this is what we are against.</p>
