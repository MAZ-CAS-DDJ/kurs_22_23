<p>Okay cool. Which did you think you cool, the Arditi shield pin or the CD buying part? Also, I am pretty poor too, so I'll save up money for a while buy a couple of CD's and save up my money again for a while and when I feel I have enough and make sure that I can cover my bills first then I'll buy more. I do the same thing with books.</p>
