<p>yeah no problem, hopefully they'll lead you somewhere useful! yeah i hate that the church feels they have to pander to modernist bullshit like that. sacred and holy areas like a church should be closed off from the modern world and the mundane and feel like something separate and otherworldly. i really like latin chants, dies irae and salve regina especially. well christianity is pretty much corrupt all the way to the top, if the pope is in with the enemy it almost seems hopeless to wish for a crusade. we can dream though haha</p>

<p>not like paganism is really doing a whole lot better honestly, we still have wiccans and "heathens against hate" to deal with. so what are you ethnically, austrian? sorry for the curiosity haha</p>
