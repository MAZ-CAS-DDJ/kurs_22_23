<p>How did you become such a massive conspiracy theorist, TS?</p>

<p>Even during my semi-Marxist days I believed their was a New World Order. I did not believe it was Jewish or anything of the sort. I saw it as a non-racial mostly white gentile movement of bankers and elite people in different governments that wants to dominate the world. A few years ago I was attracted to white nationalism and eventually National Socialism. Italian Fascism did/does not focus on conspiracy facts like National Socialism did/does. Conspiracy factism is an essential part of NS.</p>
