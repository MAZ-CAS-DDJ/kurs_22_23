	Not really. We're more Militant than activist, and we're not exactly looking for moderate or average Joe type people to be part of our group. We typically recruit ex-Military only. The political climate in America is different, and most Polish diaspora are just normies. We are however purchasing a lot of land soon for training, so if Falanga ever organizes a trip to the US, you are all welcome to come train with us.
