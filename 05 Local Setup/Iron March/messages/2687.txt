<p>Debating would be rather boring if we would all be on the same level here. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>And indeed although I certainly disagree on most levels with you and don't think we will ever reach a consensus on certain points, you keep a hell of a debate with good content. So I'm happy to cross swords with someone who knows how to debate, which is unfortunaly not self-evident on this board.</p>

<p>We disagree, and likely we will disagree in the future. But I count you as an intelligent man and I like our discussion.</p>
<p>You are one of the few people I actually enjoy debating with. I am rude sometimes in debates, but ultimately I respect you. My use of arrogance is merely to determine if an opponent is respectable.</p>
<p>I like you, NSP. Even if we will always disagree, I always like intelligent people. I may mock your arguments (call this primal male stupidity if you will-- but it is a sign of respect for me), but I respect them and you.</p>
<p>Hopefully, if our disagreements are too profound, we can discuss them in messages, and reach a consensus sooner.</p>
