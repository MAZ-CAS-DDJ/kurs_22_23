	Did a year of IT networking and security. Quit that because fuck Uni and I had a lot of problems at the time including no money for textbooks or food or anything. Since then I've been doing programming in software development and computer science. Gonna hopefully become self employed and probably poor as fuck but all I want is my own land. Money doesn't mean a lot to me.
