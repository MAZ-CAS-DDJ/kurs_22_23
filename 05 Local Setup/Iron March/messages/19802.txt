	Everything you responded with would have been true, but your premise that all religions are equally correct is false. As a Pagan or whatever you are you probably consider natural law to be God, and if that were the case you would be correct that all religions are equally true. Natural law <em>comes </em>from God. All religions including those of our European ancestors <em>did </em>understand natural law. That by itself though is not sufficient. They <em>could have</em> come to the correct conclusions by understanding God through His creation (natural law), but they did not. They, like every religion other than Christianity lacks a full understanding of God through the divine revelation of Jesus Christ, the Logos. We don't just arbitrarily choose to follow a religion that has Semitic origins. It just so happens that the religion which has the full truth comes from the eastern Mediterranean. That fact alone doesn't matter though as I have said many times. It doesn't mean anything. The full truth could have come from anywhere, and it came from the eastern Mediterranean.

	Yeah every religion on the planet is just another way of understanding natural law based on the specific culture that the religion comes from, but they all lack the full truth that can only come from divine revelation. To even have a discussion about this you would have to accept the basic premise that God cannot be fully understood through human reason without divine revelation, which I assume you don't so these discussions are always pointless. It always just ends up as: Who can make a fancier post that ultimately accomplishes nothing and gets cheered on by the same exact Christians or Pagans of the forum.
