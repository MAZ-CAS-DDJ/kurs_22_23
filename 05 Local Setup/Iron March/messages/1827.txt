<p>That's what I've been looking at, actually. Going to MEPS next week as it would happen. Trying to get as much information as I can. I've a close friend who's in the Marines as of current, and stationed in Okinawa. Talking to him as often as possible, and he's able to more or less fill me in with what I need to know. I've no clue about the Army, though; it's kind of an unknown, other than reading tidbits on forums and such, that I'm walking into. I was wondering if you'd be willing to answer some questions &amp; talk?</p>
