	Well, it is more of a personal interest thing. I am much more interested in the Germanic gods as I have always enjoyed their tales. The only thing I really know about Celtic paganism is that they were Druids, which I think has now a days been hijacked by the Wicca fags. So, you just pray like you do when your Christian? Only replace God with Woden, Tyr, Thor, etc? Also, wasn't Himmler a neopagan and tried to institute it in the SS? Sorry, I am just really into the SS. Anyways, I would be happy to give you my opinion and whether or not I recommend the book when I finish. Also, if you haven't read it already, Storm of Steel is very good imo. Also, at this time I am unfortunately getting further and further from reading things like the Sagas, because more books just keep popping up! (Which isn't necessarily a bad thing :) ) But, you know when I start them because there will be a bost in what are you currently read thread or trivial happenings thread or both.

	PS Finally finished reading that Lovecraft collection, and it was great.
