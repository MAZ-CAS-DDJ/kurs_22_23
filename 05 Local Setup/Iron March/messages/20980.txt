	There's been a few Devildogs on this site, and we recently got some MARSOC guy from Texas. We need doorkickers, not intellectuals. I've been defending the point of utilizing Military service since I got here. There's always the naysayers that whine about "ZOG Military" but you already know that they're feeble minded. Its good to know I'm not the only one sacrificing 4 years for the cause. Slay bodies in boot.
