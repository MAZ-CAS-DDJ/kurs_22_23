	I recall reading in your intro thread that you took an interest in Marxism prior to arriving at Fascism/National Socialism. This might not surprise you, but I underwent a similar path of ideological development. My distaste at the capitalist system I see around me attracted me to Marxism and communism at first, which envisioned a perfect and rationally designed society, where all members of that society are united into a single community and free of what I perceive to be the chaotic irrationality of capitalism. If you compare Seoul to Pyongyang on Google Earth, you'll notice how differently the land has been developed. A residential area in Seoul tends to be a random patchwork of small homes and connecting streets, whereas in Pyongyang urban planning was used to the benefit of the community as a whole. There is a sense of beauty to that. But I found the humanitarian nature of Marxism hard to reconcile with my strong feelings about my people and their plight. There is no way I can imagine myself sharing a country with the Turks, Iranians or Arabs as would be the logical outcome of a communist system, so I abandoned communism.
