<p>Would you be interested in being an officer for the NBU? You would be responsible for your home state and for the time being, until we grow stronger, the region around it.  We could really use someone with your enthusiasm and speaking abilities. Of course I would have to clear it with the leadership first, but I don't anticipate any objections.</p>

<p>As far as the direction of the American operations go I have some ideas I need to talk with Gary about but there hasn't been much action to date. All of the ideological positions you brought up above are applicable to what we're doing and what we believe. I don't think we should emphasize one above the rest. It would depend on what's hot at the particular moment.</p>

<p>I think the wordpress site is a great idea. When you have it up and running make sure to promote here and I'll do what I can on Facebook.</p>

<p>In the meantime if you have any ideas on how to promote the NBU here in the states I would love to here them.</p>
