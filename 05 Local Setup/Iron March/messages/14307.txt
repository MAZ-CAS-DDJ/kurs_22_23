	Yeah, it was called running start. I had the aptitude for it, but decided against it. Pretty much every man in my family worked in construction at one time or another, so I figured I'd either start with that or just enlist. At that point I just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible, so I got my diploma and never looked back. Of course I would later find from a few acquaintances in the service that pretty much every branch was pozzed now that they were letting women into combat branches and being politically correct took precedence over pretty much anything else. I've been doing odd jobs for neighbors and whatnot to get some income, probably get something part time when summer rolls around, turns out you need to get a good goy card from the labor unions if you want work year round.
