<p>Very good, Socialist comrade. Now some recommendations I have:</p>
<p>I advise for State Socialism and a despotic dictator.</p>
<p>The role of the dictator is to provide the collective with a powerful State that will ensure that the predators are not vituperated or extirpated for their strength. A State in which the strong rule with an iron fist that no one will dare oppose. Destroying those who threaten the determined future of the glorious Republic. The State must be designed not to help, but to lead the many to the fulfillment of the vision you, the Eternal President of the Socialist Republic of the Philippines, have brought to life.</p>
<p>I also recommend that you form the utmost Alliance with North Korea and maintain good relations with China. Through both diplomacy and military actions aim to create an Union of Asian Socialist Republics.</p>
<p>Remember that there must be bloodshed before peace and there must be suffering before bliss.</p>
