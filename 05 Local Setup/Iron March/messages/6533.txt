<p>Hello my Russian friend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I do not have skype at present, but I will have it someday soon. I am rather poor right now, but my circumstances will change somewhat for the better once I start my new job. I'd love to skype I think.</p>

<p>I read up on Ustrailov and on 'National Bolshevism', it sounds like something I can agree with for the most part, because I already am pretty 'Strasserist' in sympathies to begin with. I don't advertise it much on the other forums i've been on, much like my admiration for Codreanu, which some 'traditionalists' who like Evola have kind of made into a faggoty fetish almost.</p>

<p>I'm Orthodox Christian, and I'm definately a 'Moscow the Third Rome' believer. History has proven that to me. I also, based on my part-Czech heritage, am pretty Pan-Slavic. I think we should get along pretty well. What I am uncertain about is what needs to be done in this day and age, beyond survival. Seems to me Russia is rising again, while America is falling apart from her contradictions. Things here could get worse someday soon than what happened in your land after the fall of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, God bless you and yours, 'michaelarchangel'</p>
