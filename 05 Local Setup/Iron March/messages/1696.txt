<p>Hello Sir, </p>
<p>When you have a spare moment, can you recommend any other essential online forums, blogs, or other resources of interest?  Do you post content anywhere?  Unlike most here, you actually know what you're talking about.  Regardless, I deeply appreciate the reading list you contributed several months ago.</p>
