	Yes, surprisingly enough, most of the guys I've listened to on podcasts and such that are former or currently in the military are Marines. One is even a Major. In my unit, there's another guy who could'v easily been a grand wizard Inn the local Klan. He's very fascist, way before I even considered it. You'll probably find the most anti establishment and hard right guyside in the Marines. In my experience anyways. The only catch up you might find is the race question, but depending on who they are personally they're probably already privy to it. For most Marines however,  we're all green underneath.
