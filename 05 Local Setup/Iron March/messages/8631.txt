<p>Not at the moment although i am planning on it, i've actually been looking into colleges recently, my issue is finding a way to pay for it (shouldn't be too hard, community colleges are my only real options at this time). Considering what I actually want to focus on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also been considering the military, it's really more of a question of when rather than if, honestly i thought i'd of joined up by now, getting too old to be a grunt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other than that I do irregular work and country stuff.</p>
