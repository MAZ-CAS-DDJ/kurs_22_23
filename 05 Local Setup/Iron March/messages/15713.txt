	You inviting me to Australia m8? With me, it was once again a genetics thing. I had to get glasses in the 2nd grade and have been wearing a pair ever since. I also really can't see without my glasses (everything is just blury). So, I literally have to wear them all day everyday. You should be fine however if you have never even had them.
