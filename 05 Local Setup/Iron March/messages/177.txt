<p>I didn't answer this then because it is not a simple or conventional answer.</p>
<p>The only political change mosley sought was a strong cabinet with the power to enact legislation that people had voted for, but there would still be elections every 4-5 years and change of government. The 20-30's was a time of very weak government when through forced compromise policy makers were unable to enact the type of legislation that was being carried out across europe. it was felt that the solution to alot of the problems was to have a system that could get more done.</p>
<p>The concept of removing opposition simply came out of the fact that they believed it would be the young men of ambition that would take over the leadership roles in politics in a simmilar way that the new political class was able completely replace the old leadership in both the west and Russia.</p>
<p>Example of how social group wipes out all opposition, whaping politics in it's own image - yet still politically diverse</p>
<p>Labour went from a party of workers to a party of upper-middle class social liberals (current leader son of marxist intellectual)</p>
<p>Conservatives went from the party of the establishment to the party of new money (Current leader ex marketing scumbag)</p>
<p>Liberals went from a party of alternative radical outsiders/independants to a party of cultural marxist interest groups: Gays, Liberals, Minorities, students.</p>
<p>ect</p>
<p>Mosley was associated with all these political parties in all their old incarnations. Now they are part of the political class; they all have the same sort of values and the same vision for how society should be run, they differ slightly on civil rights issues and less on economics.</p>
