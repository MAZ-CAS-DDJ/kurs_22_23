<p>Hey man. I havent watched it whole yet, got through the first 30 or so episodes, and I will continue when I get more time. I dont really like anime either and I cant stand webs, but lotgh seems decent and a rank above the other staff I've seen. I heard stuff about a remake or a novel release, but I guess its a visual novel? Idk, I'll check it out when it comes. </p>

<p>The stuff I've seen so far I like for the most part, and I've a read bit on the story to follow. When I first heard of it I thought its gonna some space fighter type of thing, with ace fliers doing ebin manouvers and shit, which was okay I guess but I'd find it boring as it would turn into animu over the top shit, and I was very presently surprised that was about actual tactical fleet battles with slow moving ships and classical music blastic, great stuff. </p>

<p>I like the overall theme and all, but I have some minor grievances so far. The founder of the Empire and almost all of the nobles and Emperors since then are represented as evil, all though the old republic and the rebel republic are just as corrupt themselves. It doesnt really paint the Empire as good, but it doesnt represent the republic as goody two shoes either, its sort of a grey area where everyone is corrupt, except for our wunderkinds, Wenly and Reinhardt. The Empire looks far less corrupt and degenerate then the Republic, but nepotism and false elitism are certainly a plague as its riddled with incompetent blue blood officers. Reinhardt seems to be driven by butthurt about his sister, and looks like he wants to turn the Empire into a parliamentary democracy, which would unknown to him just lead to much more corruption. </p>

<p> I'm looking forward to see what Phezzan and the Earth cult are up to, Phezzan does seem very Jewy. Thats my take on it so far. </p>
