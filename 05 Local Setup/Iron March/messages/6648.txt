<p> </p>Atatürk himself did not denounce the idea, but unlike Enver Pasha(whom I also adore), he was a calculating man, and he thought that the best way to serve the Turkish race was to first save what was at hand, Anatolia.</div></div></blockquote>

<p>Enver Pasha died a glorious death, outnumbered and facing the enemy. I have heard various accounts of his death. In some, he fell while charging into the enemy, blade and Quran in hand, others say he felled by machine gun fire while shooting at the Bolsheviks. I do not believe the account which says he was killed in hiding by some Armenian.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have read an interesting account about Enver Pasha in the <a href="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89092588227;view=1up;seq=9" rel="external nofollow">memoirs</a> of Rafael Nogales. Armenians like to quote Nogales selectively to support their genocide claims, while ignoring the fact that Nogales had a very high opinion of Turkish soldiery, and also notes atrocities committed by Armenians.</p>

<p>That was a little too much even for the phlegmatic Britishers. A squadron of Australians picked up the glove. The Cross and the Crescent clashed amid a cloud of dust. After the fight was called off only about three dozen Australians and Turks remained standing in their stirrups. Not a rifle, machine-gun or fieldpiece cracked or thundered on either side until that handful of Knights of St. George and Paladins of Allah had safely re- treated to their respective lines. <i>El-Hand-Ul-Illah! </i>While speaking about the Turkish soldier I cannot help remembering Enver Pasha, the greatest man that Turkey produced for many a generation. He was a soldier, a statesman and a patriot. It was on a sunny morning of January, 1915, that we met; a day which I will never forget because that morning I felt as if I had discovered America. It all seemed so strange to me, especially after I had donned my first Turkish uniform and walked up the broad marble staircase of the war department to report to his Excellency, Colonel Enver Bey (later Enver Pasha), secretary of war and vice-generalissimo of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>When I stepped out of the auto at the main entrance of the enormous rectangular four-story-high <i>Ministère de la Guerre, </i>which stood solitary in the center of an empty <i>maidan</i> surrounded by kiosks and a tall, iron railing, a military band, dressed in historical uniforms, was playing a weird, wild march such as the janissaries used to play long ago, while besieging Budapest or charging Napoleon's Old Guard at the foot of the Pyramids.</p>
<p>I felt a real thrill as I crossed and recrossed the beautifully decorated reception halls before I was finally ushered into Enver's office. The minute I entered he rose, smiled affably, shook hands with me cordially, invited me to sit down and, after we had smoked a cigaret and enjoyed a thimbleful of black coffee <i>à la turca, </i>we parted the best of friends. He was about forty or forty-two at that time*, medium-sized, slender, extremely good-looking, wore a mustache <i>à la Kaiser</i> and had a charming personality.</p>
<p>He never used his official titles.</p>
<p>"I am Enver; glad to meet you," was the way he introduced himself.</p>
<p>Being the first A. D. C. to the Sultan he naturally wore an A. D. C.'s uniform, but only a plain one, like that of any of his own A. D. C.'s.</p>
<p>Once, in the spring of 1918, one of our former Austrian officers on the Sinai front, a captain of artillery, wanted to meet Enver very badly before he returned to Austria. He had been proposed for a war medal which only Enver could confer. So he begged me to secure him an audience with II <i>Seiner Exzellenz! </i>" I got it for him, naturally. He was to be received on Tuesday at 2 p.m. sharp. His audience was to last <i>five minutes, </i>which means two minutes more than was usually granted to subaltern officers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few days later I met our captain again. He had got his medal all right, but there was a story attached to it. After being ushered through four different reception rooms, and after having been asked by four different A. D. C.'s whom he wanted to see, he entered a fifth <i>salon</i> where another A. D. C., dressed exactly like the others, addressed him with a courteous:</p>
<p>" Anything I can do for you, sir ? "</p>
<p>"Do what?" the captain snarled angrily. "of course you can; I have got to med: Enver Pasha at 2 p. m. sharp. Through all of these blooming delays I have lost already three of the precious five minutes which my audience is supposed to last!"</p>
<p>Instead of getting angry, the A. D. C. smiled affably and replied:</p>
<p>"Please, don't worry, Captain. I am Enver." He immediately granted the captain's request.</p>
<p>Unlike other Young Turk leaders, Enver was a man who ro~ by his own force of character. He was the hero of the Tripoli campaign, during the Italo-Turkish conflict in 1910-11, and it was he who turned the tide in favor of the Turkish army during the Second Balkan War.</p>
<p>After the fall of Adrianople the Turkish Cabinet which was then in power had assembled in the palace of the Sublime Porte for the purpose of signing an armistice by means of which Turkey ceded not only Adrianople, but practically the whole of Thrace to the Bulgars. A few minutes before the proposed treaty was to be signed and sealed, Enver and two other Young Turk army officers presented themselves, unexpectedly, and demanded that the cabinet immediately sign its resignation. The secretary of war was the only member of the council of state who refused to sign, whereupon Enver shot him down and, assuming the supreme command of the Turkish army, reconquered Adrianople from the Bulgars and built up, with the help of Marshal Liman von Sanders' German military mission, a modern Turkish army.</p>
<p>This not only withstood the Allies during the World War, but finally freed the Ottoman Empire from the humiliating "extraterritorial rights," or capitulations, by means of which the imperialistic European nations had kept Turkey in bondage for over half a century.</p>
<p>Enver died during the Greek conflict in 1923, while he rushed at the head of several thousand Turkomen to the aid of Mustapha-Kemel, who had begged him to come to his rescue. He shot his way through the Bolshevik troops which tried to block his advance, but ran out of ammunition and, when he charged again at the head of his tribesmen, a Red soldier pumped a machine-gun load into him, at five yards distance, which tore him to pieces.</p>
<p>Thus died Enver Pasha, the biggest Young Turk and the real protagonist of modern Turkey.</p>
<p>The indomitable courage—or fanaticism; call it what you will—and the traditional boldness of the Osmanlis, frequently during the World War offered examples of that ferocious endurance which, from time immemorial, has made them famed as one of the most valiant and warlike nations of the Old World.</p>
<p>During our Caucasus campaign I repeatedly ran across trenches filled with corpses-the frozen bodies of our <i>askars, </i>both officers and men—who had frozen to death rather than budge from the positions they had been ordered to hold at any price. During those dreadful months among the eternal snows of the Caucasus the Muscovite high command had ordered its Russian divisions to be replaced by the Siberian Iron Legions, because even the Russian <i>mujiks</i> could not withstand any longer the terrible cold.</p>
<p>We were fighting most of the time up to our necks in the snow, at an altitude anywhere from ten to twelve thousand feet above sea level Nevertheless the Turks, who had been rushed to the front with hardly any preparations at all, or even an adequate service of supplies, owing to the rapidity with which things had happened, stood their ground wonderfully well; sometimes even without overcoats or proper footwear; in many cases without the necessary medical attention and, most of the time, with hardly anything to eat except a crust of bread. Those were men who knew how to fight and die without a murmur, without ever showing the slightest sign of insubordination.</p>
<p>During our miscarried offensive of Sari-Kamish; near Erzeroum, in 1915, for instance, we lost thirty thousand men in less than two days, mostly frozen to death. Nevertheless, in spite of that drawback, our Third Caucasus army kept fighting the Russians and driving them back at the point of its bayonets with more vigor than ever.</p>
<p>A far greater toll than by bullets and cold was exacted from us by the terrible typhus epidemic which broke out in Turkey almost immediately after the beginning of the World War. On our Caucasus front, where we were separated from the rest of the world by a roadless barrier of two hundred miles of mountainous frozen wilderness, hundreds and even thousands of our wounded and typhus-stricken <i>askars</i> , for whom there was no room left in our Erzeroum lazarets, were handed some money and a knapsack full of food and allowed to trek back across the howling wilderness in search of Erzindjan, Trebizond or Sivas, which were the only three towns provided with hospitals within a radius of two hundred miles.</p>
<p>I met hundreds of those poor dying wretches along the goat- trails which crossed those snowy wastes. Most of them were al- ready on their way to the great beyond: Living skeletons who were dragging themselves by the dozen on hands and knees over the frozen snow-fields, closely followed by ravenous bands of wolves which were waiting only for the night to set in. I remembered a wounded soldier who had bandaged a fresh saber-cut on his arm with some filthy rags which he had torn from the festering wounds of a dead comrade.</p>

<p>Nogales seems to have relied on rumors and hearsay in describing Enver Pasha's death, and the relation he had with Atatürk‎, but otherwise, his memoirs are pretty solid.</p>

<p>Only recently, 200 Turks have been allowed to cross to Turkey from Thailand, and that was because there was an enourmous pressure from the Turkish public to let them in, else, the government would have left them to rot.</p>

<p>Your country hosts thousands of Syrian Arabs in state of the art facilities, 200 of your ethnic kin shouldn't be a problem. Why has the government shown such reluctance?</p>

<p>The current state in Turkey is also not too well. The fact that we're being held ransom by a bunch of Kurds in the mountains, is truly an insult to our heritage, and the Turkish national identity is being tried every day, whether it will ultimately fail or still hold strong. Atatürk and Atsız, have all forseen these. We're digging our own graves.</p>
</div></div></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Indeed, I can imagine how frustrating it must be to see your government granting concessions to terrorist and separatist Kurds. Such a course of action will likely only embolden them to make further demands.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the American Southwest, there are high schools which have banned students from displaying the American flag, while Mexican flags are permitted. A Federal Appeals court has even upheld these bans, and its possible that the issue will reach the Supreme Court. This is to say nothing of the Atzlan separatist groups which operate openly, or the bile spewed regularly on University campuses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The government refuses to decisively tackle the illegal immigration issue, instead preferring to make oblique promises about "securing the border" and "immigration reform". Meanwhile, the illegal immigrants continue to benefit from American social services, education, and healthcare, while pumping out ever more children. Some traitorous politicians have even suggested that we should give the illegal immigrants a "path to citizenship".</p>

<p> </p>As for the Armenians, true, there are surely good people amongst them, however, what I dislike about them is that they prefer to do things the...dishonorable way. They dream of getting back Mt. Ararat and our Eastern Provinces, yet the best they can do is to hope for stronger nations to intervene, and enforce their claims. The Greeks on the other hand, have tried, honorably, to take our coastal areas, and have declared a state of total war just for this reason. Greeks have fought, bravely with a purpose, they failed, but no dishonor was upon them. The Armenians on the other hand still claim that they have rights on our lands based on a treaty we tore up with our bayonets, and just as the Jews, scream Genocide to legitmize it.<p></p>
<p>If they are serious, I suggest that they prepare for war as they did in Karabagh.</p>

<p>Sadly, they are ignoring the harm they are inflicting on their descendants by instilling the victim mentality inside them. Armenia has sold its self-determination to Russia, and depends heavily on diaspora Armenians. I have noticed that without <em>Hye Tahd</em> (the campaign for Armenian Genocide recognition), American Armenians would have been assimilated a long time ago. Amusingly, some Armenians refer to the assimilation of diaspora Armenians as a "White Genocide" (<i>Spitak Jard</i>, a concept similar to the Jews' "Silent Holocaust"). I for one cannot fathom how they have the right to demand a separate existence, if anything, if they hold such views, then they should buy a one-way ticket to Yerevan if they feel so 'oppressed' in America. After all, if I didn't like the US, I could try to become a naturalized Chinese citizen (this would actually be quite difficult).</p>
