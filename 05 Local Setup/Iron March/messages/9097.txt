<p>Hey Venator,<br /><br />I just wanted to let you know that I got your last message and sent a reply back to you with answers to your questions. Anyways as far as the philosophical discussions goes if there is any suggestions about what you want to discuss please let me know. I personally have just started reading Nietzsche's book The Will to Power, perhaps after I am done we may discuss this. However, I ask that you please give me time to finish it, as I will be very busy this summer with work and trying to get into shape(I will admit that for a Fascist I am a tad out of shape).<br /><br />Blackshirt 13<br /><br />PS I will always make time for our philosophical discussions. For now I will leave to you as to what to discuss. However, I will have a suggestion soon. Also, if you are having problems with your e-mail do what I do and just check your e-mail/IronMarch profile a couple times a day.</p>
