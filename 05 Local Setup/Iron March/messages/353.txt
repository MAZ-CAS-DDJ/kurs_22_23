<p>I'm tellin you, I'm glad they ran off that furry, but their arguments that he was projecting on his life a fantasy, i think half this board is doing the same thing.  I analyze posts, and I'm not ready to call people out just yet but based on what they say about their personal lives, most of these people would be killed off by even a moderate fascist government.  I'm wary of what they say.  I'm not that impressed by ideology, I want to see how it is applied to everyday life.   I am certainly not any sort of Fascist intellectual but I apply what I have learned and agree with into my daily life, I think half of these posters draw nazi art on deviant art and don't do much else.</p>
