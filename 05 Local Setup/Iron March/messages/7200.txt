<p>Boxing for years now, it's just that sometimes I train more intensively, sometimes less. Lately I've had more time so I devoted more time to sport.</p>

<p>You mean Slovene accent as in Slovenes speaking English? Or my accent of Slovenene? I speak in Ljubljana accent, ie. the accent spoken here in the capital. If you want to hear how Slovene sounds like I can post you some music I guess.</p>

<p>It's nice that you found this ideology. Don't mind what people think, it's a great way to live your live, it's a code of honour and the more you read about it the more you see how much truth it is in it. Especially if you follow what goes on in modern world with all this degeneration.</p>

<p>I came to this ideology way back in 2004 through local football hooligans connected to Blood&amp;Honour NS skinhead organization. I was involved in football fan scene first and most people I came up with had right wing ideas too. I read a lot of stuff on the internet through the years and developed some basic knowledge of the ideology because I was really interested in it, but I was far-right already because all the cool people I knew in real life had such views. This entire scene was just magical, with cool music, symbols, slogans and a badass reputation. It was all I wanted to be and I still remember how cool it was to be a "fascist" hooligan back when I was on high school, there were like 5 of us on our school which was more leftist-leaning, and we were known by everyone. I was happy to belong to something big and powerfull, everytime media reported something about neo-nazism or football hooliganism we felt even more proud and stronger. Later I devoted more time to "intellectual"/philosophical aspects of the ideology and became even more convinced it's the right path.</p>
