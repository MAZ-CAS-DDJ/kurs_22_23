<p>I reckon we're better off ditching the name Sigurd, tbh - don't want to forever be associated with a guy who said he'd had a 'crisis of conscience' and 'was no longer racist'...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Apparently there's a rule-of-thumb in the world of marketing when coming up with a name for a product, and that's 'the shorter the better.' Makes it more memorable/ more readily communicable in everyday communication. So we need something short, like Sigurd, or something that can be truncated to a shorter form, like Sigurd Legion to Sigurd. I'm open to suggestions on this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The overall aesthetic of Sigurd on the other hand, we can keep. Developing it over time as we see fit. So with that in mind, I'm definitely open to your input on how it should look, etc. And feel free to give your opinion on anything else to do with the project for that matter.</p>

<p>I'll probably be looking at putting everything into a website, a pdf (maybe), and videos. Which I'm hoping you can sort out cos I'm fucking clueless.</p>
