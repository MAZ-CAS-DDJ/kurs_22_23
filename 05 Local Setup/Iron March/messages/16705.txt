	Dear Oakleaf,
</p>

<p>
	         The PLAN is accelerating faster than we expected. My own masters have given me instructions - we have to keep subverting this board, keep bringing people in the fold of the Dark Lord. Soon, we will have complete control. But we must act quickly or else all our hard work will go to waste - they are become wise to my...<em>our</em> intentions. Oakleaf, I would like to accept you as an apprentice and teach you the ways of the Dark Lord. But you have to leave behind fascism and the ways of the material world forever to find true transcendence and power.
</p>

<p>
	I look forward to hearing from you to put the final stages of the PLAN into action.
</p>

<p>
	AVE SATANAS DIO OSCURO
</p>

<p>
	                                                                                          Sincerely, your friend and Servant of the Dark Lord
</p>

<p>
