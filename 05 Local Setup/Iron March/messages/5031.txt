<p>Well as you said in the thread it's usually not a good idea for Soldier to be very politicized most of the time, as his duty as a soldier is soldiering not poltics.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm not in the Military yet but when I do enter I imagine that as much as I might want to proselytize people on the virtues of Fascism I imagine that would just be a red flag and get me in trouble/discharged.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Which since i'm favoring going the ROTC route means that I probably have to keep my mouth shut then as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's incredibly annoying to try and advocate Fascism and in the same time have to seclude yourself into Crypto-Fascism out of pragmatism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don't like bullshitting people, if they ask me what I beleive politcally i'll tell them whether they like it or not and just have to walk on eggshells in annoying and ironically humorous for all the systems promotion of Tolerance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not that i expect anything else it just goes to show the hypocrisy of modern values.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Racism in the Military? Idk you'd have to specifiy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Like can people be allowed to say "Nigger" and "Kike" and stuff like that without getting in trouble? yeah.</p>
