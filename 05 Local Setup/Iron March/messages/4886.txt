<p>CI means christian identity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's an idea I've been working with a while; Rockwell wanted it implemented to infiltrate these racist christian movements and use them to make his ideas more mainstream. I doubt many fascists would deny that the Mosaic law is one of the most just legal systems you could get, and it would be since it's not Jewish at all and was stolen from the code of hammurabi in Babylon. Jews left to their own devices implement thousands of laws as can be seen in the Babylonian talmud and today. The only difference between Christianity and Jews is that they don't believe Jesus was messiah; the new testament still has a Jewish supremacist outlook over non jews and passages even say it. It makes little difference whether Ancient Israelites were different from the sephardic and ashkenazi Jews of today; their genealogy relates them together and it's just a fact. It's like the differences between Englishmen and Welshmen.</p>

<p>My idea is mainly to get the lurkers rather than the forum members but if it helps radicalize a few forum members then that's good too. William Pierce uses the idea of using CI to their advantage in Hunter as well. Christian thought lingers today in most fascists, so if they're convinced the christian religion says this and this is okay then they atleast become a little more open minded to pagan aspects (or instincts). The only problem here is I've seen people use Christianity to make arguments for faggotry like in the example of the queen james bible and saying the passages concerning faggotry are about idol worship, in that way it's a liability and must be thrown away in the end.</p>
