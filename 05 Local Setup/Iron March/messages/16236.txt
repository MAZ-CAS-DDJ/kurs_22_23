	Greetings! I was just writing about my findings when I got your message. The last two days I was researching the history of Algeria and the symbols you are using on your blog. I will share you the information I have found; please tell me if I am wrong or if you have something to add.
</p>

<p>
	One of the national symbols of Algeria is the ancient <strong>Khamsah</strong>, or the <strong>'Hand of Fatimah'</strong> which was used even before Islam and they are using it since then as a symbol of protection. I have found three historical eras of critical importance, the first is the<strong> Carthaginian Empire</strong>, what is well known because of the <strong>Punic Wars</strong>. The second is the reign of the <strong>Almohad Caliphate</strong>. The founder of the Almohad movement, <strong>Muhammad Ibn Tumart</strong> was one of the greatest Berber Muslims who successfully defeated the exoteric and pragmatic Almoravid dynasty of Morocco. I see him similar to Codreanu: he started a small, but elitist movement; he was a (Sufi) mystic thus he was against the wasteful lifestyle of the decadent Almoravids; he and his followers have found a safe haven in the Atlas mountains, where they became a disciplined ascetic community of strict regulations and what became their base of operations. He died in 1130 - and similarly to Codreanu he was never able to see the victory of his movement in his life. His successor, <strong>Abd al-Mumin</strong> finished his work by conquering every region of North Africa where Berbers lived (this territory was the prefiguration of your dream, the United North Africa). They have also crossed the Mediterranean Sea and attacked Spain achieving great victories. There was a mysterious mosque this Empire started to build (but never finished), what is called the <strong>Hassan Tower</strong> and which would have been the greatest mosque in the world.

	I will share you a story here. There was a visionary nun born in 1901 in Hungary, who has foreseen the destruction the Second World War will cause and in 1936 she warned our Church that in her visions Jesus asked Hungary to build a chapel of atonement and repent our sins or else we will suffer a much greater bloodshed than we had in the Great War. We didn't listen to her, and we didn't build this chapel since then. There are important things we have to do, and I think both the Hungarians and the Berbers have to finish the work of their forefathers to be able to build a better future.

	After the fall of the Almohads came the Kingdom of Tlemcen (I still have to research this era) and after Tlemcen came the Ottoman Empire, then the French. Then came <strong>Abdelkader</strong> you already spoke me about. They say he was using a flag though they are not sure how it was looked like. Here is a possible depiction of it:

<p>
	The 'Union Démocratique du Manifeste Algérien' which was created in 1946 were using a similar flag:

<p>
	The Algerian nationalists used this one at that time:

<p>
	The hand is presented on all of these flags. Is that the depiction of the Khamsah?
</p>

<p>
	I have also found out that you are using the <strong>Eagle of Saladin</strong>, who waged war against the Crusaders but who we have great respect for because of his noble character and his great wisdom. In the modern times his eagle was introduced by Gamal Abdel Nasser after his victorious revolution in Egypt in 1952. Later it became the Coat of Arms of the United Arab Republic (Egypt &amp; Syria), Yemen, the Ba'athist Iraq, Qaddafi's Libya, and Palestine, but today it's only Egypt, Iraq and Palestine which are using it. The other heraldic beast what is widespread in the region is the Hawk of Quraish. Could you make me clear what's the difference between them? Are these representing two political factions, maybe they have something to do with the Arab revolutionary movements like the Nasserists, the Ba'athists and the followers of Qaddafi? Why did you choose the Eagle and not the Hawk?
</p>

<p>
	Also, the Emblem you are using is the modified version of the Coat of Arms of Transnistria. Why is that? :D What is the letters C. N. P. A. are standing for?
</p>

<p>
	And what about the symbol you just sent me? I have never seen it before. 'Nova Icosium' is in the filename, but all I know that it was a city of the ancient Punics/Carthaginians, but I wasn't able to find the symbol itself.
