<p>Not you in particular; I'm just very critical of the Enlightenment, and I also think that Europeans who are anti-Christian set themselves against Europe itself.</p>
<p>  I wouldn't say that the Enlightenment is evil or anything like that,  I do see all the benefits of technology but I recognize it as a double edged-sword. The Enlightenment is certainly proof that Europeans are supreme in their impact upon the world, for good and for worse. I think it is very important for people to understand that many of the wrong and destructive ideas of today are rooted in the Enlightenment and Renaissance.</p>
<p>  As for the Christian issue, I really have no issue with fellow nationalist/fascist types rejecting Christianity. But, the neo-pagan faggots who actively oppose the more traditional Christian forms come off as suicidal as the white liberals. I say that, because I see religious forms as absolutely integral to the human condition and to European survival. I accept that the pagan religious forms of antiquity are long dead, and I accept Christianity as the religion of Europe. All of which are historical realities.</p>
<p> I also accept the fact that religious forms are dispensed from on high, so I think it would be ridiculous for human beings to attempt to reconstruct dead religions or even attempt to construct new religions when there already exists a religious form that contains the eternal esoteric truths required for initiation into the mysteries of God.</p>
<p> As far I am concern, the religious issue of Europe is this: either we rediscover the esoteric Christian Faith, wait for a new form of paganism to spontaneously arise, or be overcome by Islam. This spiritual vacuum will be filled regardless, we will be required to accept which ever one is chosen by Providence. I only hope it is the ancient Christian Faith the once united Europe.</p>
<p> To you, the compassion of Christ may seem to only be an expression of weakness. I just hope that you can recognize that the Faith is as much about struggle as it is about love and compassion.</p>
