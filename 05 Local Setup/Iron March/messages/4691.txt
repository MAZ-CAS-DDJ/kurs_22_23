<p>I don't think there is an ideal monarchist world, really, and I don't like getting involved in other countries and their monarchies.</p>
<p>For my country I would favor the restoration of a Bonapartist Empire, but it's all at the end of a very long tunnel.</p>
<p>So authoritarian hereditary ruler, weak parliamentary structure, press supervision, direct contact between people and monarch...</p>
<p>Some democracy on lower levels, less as you move up. On aristocracy I'm divided between a purely decorative one (titles but none with power or salary) or a meritocratic/hereditary hybrid where you're audited for your title, but that would be a novel idea.</p>
