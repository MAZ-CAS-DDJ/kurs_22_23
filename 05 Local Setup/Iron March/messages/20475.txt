	honestly, only two flash demos I've been involved with has went well, the rest have in some way been excessively and illegally shut down by police. UK laws and AUS laws are obviously different and it mostly depends really on if the cops who respond are pricks or not. Just assume they will be and prepare for an illegal arrest to which the officers performing said illegal arrest will receive no consequences. 15-20 is more than enough, but it really depends on what you're doing really. Like, take into accounts there have been demos in the UK liased correctly with Police and all legal avenues, yet they have turned into total chaos (White Man March in Liverpool and the big demo in Dover two years ago) because the police have just decided to stand back and let the violence unfold, and then arrested nearly 100 Nationalists who are all now in jail for at least two years each. Many more people are currently on bail and awaiting sentence. Problem with this stuff is, there's not really any advice to give because every demo is different. Police in Scotland are usually really courteous and understand the reds cause all the trouble, but go to Glasgow (our biggest city) and they will go out their way to be assholes to you.
