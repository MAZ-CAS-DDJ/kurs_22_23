<p>You make some excellent points about the unworthiness of the Jews as God's chosen people and their fall, but even if many Ashkenazim are Khazar, other groups like the Sephardim have reached similar positions of influence in their host lands and been thrown out, so I'm not sure if that explains why the Jews jew. The idea of medieval kebabs deciding to convert to Judaism en masse is certainly fascinating, though. Gahhh, you're making me consider reverting. Although I'm still unsure how the soul doctrine applying to humans intersects with the non-human hominid blood thought to be in most peoples. Genetics and the measure of predestination associated with it is what made me start to doubt. </p>
