	G'day, nice to get in touch with people from around SA. I found out about this website from another guy in the group. A few of us have been meeting for a couple of years, but recently it seems to have snowballed a little and now as I said in my intro there's about seven of us who consistently meet on a Sunday afternoon in the Adelaide Hills. Where abouts in adelaide are you?Â
