<p>Yes, hopefully. Really, it's simply an effect of international debt slavery, which the West faces as well. It's just more of a direct result in Africa. Honestly, a huge milestone for fascist movements would simply be to get people to become aware of the debt crisis and how international private banks actually own the rights to manipulate currency. If people just become aware of that, then fuck ideology for the time being. People would be furious if they did some simple research and realized how the monetary system works. But unfortunately, people won't do the slightest amount of research.Â </p>
