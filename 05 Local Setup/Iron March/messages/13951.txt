	Sad thing is most of paganism is pure cancer. By that I mean communities / people who call themselves pagan. This is why I suggest mostly reading the source rather than anything else. Asatru is better than wiccan faggots but not by much. Odinists are generally pretty good, but still has a lot of faggotry. It's like all the pozzed up Christian churches / denominations.
