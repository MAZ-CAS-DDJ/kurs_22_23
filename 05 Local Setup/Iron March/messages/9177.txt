<p>Teanaste'lle'n my yellow Brother. I welcome you to the site, I understand your plight in Japan. They have become materialistic and mediocre and lost their way. I hope you become the next Yukio Mishima. Ethiopia and Japan have colorful relationship with each other. I hope we become allies. Speak to The Colonel he's also Asian. </p>
