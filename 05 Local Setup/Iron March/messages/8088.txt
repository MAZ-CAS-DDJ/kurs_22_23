<p>The benifit of craig gone is that all the personality went into that - his idea, his book, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is what I know about web security;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Despite the reputation of Hushmail and Safemail most people avoid them. Hushmail has servers in new england and they comply with standard court orders if it came to it - bear in mind that UK and US have shared intelligence services and co-operate in war on terror. Safemail has its servers in Israel - I thought that was an improvement but I got so sick of being told this that I gave up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The only reliable email client is riseup.net an anarchist webring. This is what major vendors in drugs and firearms use and it has been entirely effectlve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. You need to consider what it is you really need. I think the more important thing is human security, there is no point in having a safe email if you keep the password on your desk or a third party has put a RAT or Keysttroke moniter on your computer. It is about cutting out the trail.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A good example is threema - an intant messaging service that the German nationalist use, it is an android app. Its simplicity is what makes it effective, like any flash there are no records. This is something that tommy could have really done with as it would have avoided a lot of hassle. It is very easy for authorities to moniter text.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. Tor is essential, I don't know if you already use it or whether I am bringing anything new to the table but basically your IP is masked and nothing you do is logged on your computer. registering an email through that like mail.com and just remembering the login details is secure as it assumes nobody knows who is using it, and if they did try and find it they would have to prove who it was.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regarding anonymity you don't really have this while internet persona so there isn't really going to be much of an expose. I would write to 192 and follow the procedure for removing your details, as I had been contacted this way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I agree completely on look, I have never made propaganda for stuff that wasn't real .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If there is more music on the way then I look forward to it. I have been discussing GT's nu metal project a lot, shoud have the finished EP this month.</p>

<p>All the ukrainian nationalists are big into black metal. I try and incorporate as many styles as possible. What is important is moving away form the puritain years of the BNP which had a kind of soviet view regarding creativity.</p>
