	I've been planning a fraternity of sorts, and ideas for a culture club for our sort of thinkers and people in our circles, but I need more likeminded people, so I'm going to join <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> London and meet more people. I know someÂ good people in other countries, so hopefully we'll set up a wide spread network for material and more.
