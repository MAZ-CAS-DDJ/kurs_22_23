<p>No problem, dude. Anti-Catholic Ukrainians are according to my observation a rare occurrance and mostly confined to the internet. Most of them are not Ukrainian nationalists though, rather russophiles, pan-orthodoxists or pan-slavists. The UGCC has played an important role in the development of Ukrainian nationalism, Greek Catholics were the driving force behind both factions of the OUN and accounted for the majority of UPA-fighters and Ukrainian Waffen-SS volunteers (as you already noted in the thread). The Greek Catholic regions are a stronghold of Ukrainian nationalism up to this day.</p>
<p>I wish you all the best, people willing to dedicate their life to God have my utmost respect. Is there a large Ukrainian community where you live?</p>
