<p>We've had a growing problem with libertarians on this board. FasCap, NatCap, even Ms. Rand atleast pretend to be authoritarian, but we're now getting out-and-out members that profess their libertarianism right on their profile. Shouldn't they all be held to the "opposing views" subforums?</p>
<p>Aside from that, I've noticed the occasional crazy in here as well. Should we be tolerating members who believe "the life of a single wolf is worth more than a million men"?</p>
