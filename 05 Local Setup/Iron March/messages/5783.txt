<p>Women's primary responsibility is the home if she is a mother.  If circumstances are such that she never finds a suitable mate or doesn't want a husband, she should be free to be independent and be successful in whatever field she chooses.  A woman shouldn't be ostracized for not being married.  And you are most certainly welcome.</p>
