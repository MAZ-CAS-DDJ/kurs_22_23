<p>I became a monarchist because I realized that republicanism is destructive and ruins national identity.  It easily ends with the nation dying away in multiculturalism.  If you ask me, all problems with a country can be traced back to when it abandons its traditional government for democracy and republicanism.</p>
<p>I prefer death metal and rock music and I am a huge fan of sci-fi.  Furthermore, I'm usually bigger than most of my peers and I seem to intimidate most of them so I probably could handle a fight.  I'm from America but I've lost faith in it recently.</p>
