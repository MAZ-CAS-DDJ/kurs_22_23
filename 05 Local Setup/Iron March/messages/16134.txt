	my mate told me of a guy in his batallion who was caught calling somebody a nigger and almost was sent home..
</p>

<p>
	maybe it was because they were in benning?
</p>

<p>
	i plan on joining the navy to be a corpsman and go greenside to serve the marine corps
</p>

<p>
	basically all they do is load up on career experience and sit in the barracks, stitching up marines whenever they break each other
