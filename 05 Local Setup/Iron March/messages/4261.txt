<p>I get where you're coming from. But I think we need to focus on having new canadians being able to function in greater canadian society.  chinese man should be able to move cross country. read the traffic signes and legal documents get a job he can do well in working side by side with european canadians and not be called the token gook or "that slanty eyed fuck." No one wants to work under condistions where you need to be on your toes and ready to doge insults.</p>
<p>Also if you are in a possition of only being able to speak mandrin (or whatever your native language is) you cut yourself off from the rest of the country. While im not expecting the first generation to intigrate flawlessly but the concer is for the following generations.</p>
<p>Now as for how europan Canadians are diffrent from where we come from the main line I use is that if one were to go back to the homeland we would not be able to instantly function in said homeland. We are acustomed to our new home. We drink beer. watch hockey and have coffee at tims. We have developed our own norms and have split from our european contemporaries. Now we still have our holidays and traditions but we are diffrent and the longer we live apart the wider the gap will grow. I think all of us should remember who we are and where we come from. But we have goals and aspirations that are not only seperate from the US but Europe as well and yes minorities should stay minorities. The immigration door will be more or less closed and tightly controlled.</p>
<p>As for the suggestion of removing usery. In the state I have in mind all the major banks are nationalised and are simply a public utility. In the time of the italian republics banks were a for profit buisness. However larger cities like florence had hundreds of small banks and functioned on service charges and that kept them all competative. Not now where all the banks function on industry standards and work together to make money.</p>
<p>Also I have no issue with jews in canada so long as they are loyal to our nation and society first. Zionists can never be trusted as they have motives that are not in the same ilk as that of our nations. They will put israel first and that is any other words is treason. One Canadian agent had the nerve to convert to judaeism and left for israel to work for mossad with a head full of canadian secrets. I cannot convey the contempt I feel for this man.</p>
