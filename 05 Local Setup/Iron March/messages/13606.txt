	I just saw this shitstorm too man, I have knowen Weissewolfe for years but he has always seemed sketchy to me. Atomwaffen always struck me as "off" tbh, with its LARP-ass name and everything. I promise you Reaction wont have the same problems, and we will be just as radical as <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>
