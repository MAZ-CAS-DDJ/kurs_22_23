<p>Great reads.  Particularly liked the info on ZBOR from you and on the 1942 Youth speech -that IS inspiring because it is so true.  As for the massacre of the volunteers by Tito (and the conspiring of the Brits?), bloody war crime if ever.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the radio link didn't work - seems like I need a specific up-grade/change.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the info.</p>
