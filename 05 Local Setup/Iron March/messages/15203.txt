	Maybe but I wouldn't hide it at all. Of course I'm rather stupid and would get persecuted for it, but that doesn't bother me too much. The problem with writing books is that it requires having something worthwhile to write. Writing for the sake of writing is pretty intellectual and faggy, and overall useless. Even the best fictional literature is written by incredibly wise and experienced authors. I see writing and all that as more of a side job you do alongside fighting the race war, or doing useful, practical things for our cause. That's not to say that you shouldn't do it, you should always pursue writing if it's what you feel is your calling, just don't necessarily rely on it as your main 'job' or income until you are set up with something else.

	What sort of stuff do you write anyways? Is it all essays and such? Either way you should try to refine what you do, get more knowledge and experience if required and start writing on a site somewhere or doing stuff for Noose if you think you can genuinely contribute.
