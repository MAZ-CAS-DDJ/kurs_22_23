<p>Ok, hmm, I am new to Forums as this is my first one....I lurked on Stormfront but its wasnt for me. When I posted all I did was hit reply and then typed my response and then post. I dont know how I I double posted but I will edit from now on. Thank you for the help. Also I had a question. Why do you think no one here actually uses their actual face in pictures? I am thinking about using my actual photo but I wanted to get your opinion on this.</p>
