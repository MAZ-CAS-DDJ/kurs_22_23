<p>Personally I see race like Evola did, Slavros mentioned this view of race in his last thread. That is that race is<em> </em>in spirit, soul and the DNA. I don't think we should only talk about the purely biological race as many 'races' or 'subraces' to begin with seem to be mixes of others rather than unique ones, and us being even more mixed up these days.</p>

<p>Evola also spoke of two polar spiritualities, the solar and the lunar. The solar being manly, strong, passionate and heroic. What we should aspire to. The lunar being more hedonistic, womanly, lazy and escapist. Much more plebeian. I think you have to consider things like this as well. That's why some spoke of a ''new race'' back in the days, molding a new man from the clay. </p>

<p>I'd recommend reading ''Revolt against the modern world'' by Julius Evola though, it's really good. </p>

<p>As for psuedoscience. Science can only measure the physical, not the metaphysical. That's pretty much it's definition. There are obviously some differences between the different biological races, a picture of black albinos should put those doubts aside. But since science is limited to the physical plane, you can't use it's methods to determine the metaphysical realm. This is also why social science sucks arse, because it is barely scientific.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, we shouldn't dismiss science. Science is great for explaining the physical world, but as said, it can't explain the metaphysical world.</p>

<p>Haven't slept the entire night now, but I hope I was helpful. Any questions?</p>
