<p>You poor bastard.  have worked with a number of Phillipinos over the years. Good people, work like dogs for nothing and are heavily exploited here. Truly sad.</p>
<p>I cant say I have ever done a kit back but I have contimplated it. See I live in a place where most of my hobbies are scarce and I can only ever buy them a few times a year.</p>
