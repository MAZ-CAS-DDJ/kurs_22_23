<p>While all these philosemitic nutjobs here certainly freak me out, I'm much more appalled by all these low-lifes for whom ideology seems to be nothing but a fashion statement, an accessoir to make them look "cool" or "badass". Don't get me wrong, this hardly applies to all of the ironmarch-users, not even the majority, but certainly to some of the most loudmouthed.</p>
<p>Yes, I am Ukrainian. The GDR was just as bad as any other communist terror regime and from what I have read, the eastern parts of Germany still bear some scars from that time (wrecked economy, high unemployment etc.). Communism is a disease and any commie, no matter if he is a typical left-winger or one of these nazbol-fuckers, should be locked away. Luckily, I was born just after the soviet union collapsed. However, in Ukraine today the power is mostly held by different kinds of mobsters and oligarchs so in the end, not too much has changed sadly enough.</p>
<p>I definitely agree with you on that one. It also proves once more that Adolf Hitler was far from being the monster he is portrayed as nowadays but quite the contrary - a sophisticated man who genuinely cared for his nation as well as for his loved ones. Sure, NS Germany had a lot of flaws, but Hitler was, at least in my eyes, not responsible for any of them. All the flawed aspects of NS policy (such as e.g. the irrational hatred for the Slavic peoples) can be traced to equally flawed characters, e.g. Himmler.</p>
