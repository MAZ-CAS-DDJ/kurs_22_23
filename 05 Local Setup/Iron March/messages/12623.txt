<p>I applaud you on your group, it's nice to see some form of organisation in Canada, but I don't uphold your views on placing Europe first. Canada is first and foremost a child of Europa, it is an extension of Europe, it is built and founded by Europeans and thus should be placed equally to or above that of Europe. Your/ours (Shit gets confusing when you're a halfbreed) ancestors built this country and therefore it is your duty to defend it, and from the decrepit structure that you protected, build it anew to the likes of which it was meant to be, another Europe.<br /><br />Any way my rambling is over, in terms of working together I have around a dozen men under my wing in a remote part of the North. I'd be lying if I said we weren't similar to the American patriotards that form their own militia. All members are armed and we practice at the firing range as much as possible. This summer I plan on organising group fitness exercises, camping/exploration trips, more firearms related activities, and lecture periods in which I teach them all they need to know about fascism. The group is slowly expanding and hopefully when we relocate to urbanised BC the group will grow far quicker.  <br /><br />Might be a good idea you hop on our skype chatrooms when you're ready.<br /><br />Hail Victory! <br /> </p>
<p>P.S. Love the merchandise you're getting, keep it up. </p>
