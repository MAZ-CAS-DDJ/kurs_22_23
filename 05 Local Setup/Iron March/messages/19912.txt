	Hi, I'm a French fascist. Like all French, I speak bad French, my phrases are sometimes badly written.

	I don't like Jews, but I consider that Islam is such a big problem. Obviously I know who is bringing them in, I know they are Jews and leftists, but when you are invaded as at home, you learn to hate Muslims, Arabs and blacks more than anything else in the world. I am a conservative because nationalist because fascist. In french language, nationalism is synonimous of fascism, when one is "civic nationalist", they are just patriotic,Â There is no white nationalist in France, or very little. Sometimes nuances in expressions make misunderstandings when I express myself, sorry, if you have any questions, do not hesitate !
