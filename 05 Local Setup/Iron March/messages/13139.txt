	Not sure where this leads and if I can be of much help. Sounds interesting.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately JW does not yet support listing of organizations. That would be very helpful.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Subvert?
</p>

<p>
	The interests will hopefully become clearer once we list everything these people do.
</p>

<p>
	There is one possible limitation in JW which is that every "claim" needs a "source" link.
</p>

<p>
	So atm it will only let you submit if you have an online resource backing up each claim.
</p>

<p>
	However, I will keep adapting JW as I go along so it becomes more powerful.
