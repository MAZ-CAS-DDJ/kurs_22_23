	Yeah, this is a new account. I tried to make an account a few months ago, same display name and everything, but the confirmation emails wouldn't ever make it to my old email account. Not even my spam folder. I just lurked as a Guest between then and now.

	As far as my redpilling story, I'd say it's pretty standard. I started as the garden variety conservative libertarian, but I always had niggling doubts about how a people would survive with no identity and no guiding force, even going as far as to say, "Fascism would be the ideal government if only it allowed people personal liberty." I also fooled myself into thinking all races were equal and socioeconomic background ruled behavior.

	Fast forward to me working my first job as an EMT in an inner city. It really opened my eyes to the diseased culture of blacks and progressives more generally. Once my notion of equality was thrown out the window, everything else followed. I found /pol/ and started reading the recommended books in the NatSoc General threads. It took a long time before I actually admitted to myself I was NatSoc, but I've been admitting it makes sense for several years.

	The research I've done alongside WWII reenacting was the final nail in the coffin. Realizing that the Germans were fighting against Judeo-Bolshevism and the world banking elite was a real eye opener after the murky haze of public school history classes all about "MUH HOLOCAUST".

	Anyway, I think that about covers my redpilling unless you have any more questions?
