<p>Danm those skirts i know what you talkign about bro. Most of the good ones have some swine that dont deserved to be with her as boyfriend... But your mistake is that you fell into depresion instead of going to gym and channel that disapointment in something usefull. But you doing it now so dont think it.  Visiting Englands is not a bad idea at all. Pile some cash and go if you dont make those things while you are younger you will never do it.. Just and advice when you buying ticket look for the two ways option, just in case.</p>
