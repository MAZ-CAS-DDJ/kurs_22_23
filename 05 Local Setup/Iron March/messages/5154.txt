<p>I do have skype but it's screwing around at the moment. I could give you my mobile number, if you want.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyway, is National Action a group in its own right or just a brand? What I'm asking, more specifically, is how formal is the membership system?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As far as my activity goes, I'm going to have a lot on my plate over the next two weeks (my family will basically be out of pocket a couple of hundred quid until then), but I can get started on anything you've got for me (or on my own initiative) immediately thereafter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'll start seeing if I can get some gauge on the strength of the local EDL/EAP and also whatever leftist groups we've got around here (they'd be the ones most likely to be holding anti-austerity protests).</p>
