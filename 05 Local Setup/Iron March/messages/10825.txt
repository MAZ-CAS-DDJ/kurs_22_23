<p>The narrative I wove is that we was in a call to play contaigon for totenkomph gaming, then there was a nock at your door, you went and answered it, I heard talking in Russian, then women crying, then door slam. Your mother then spoke to me on the call you didnt hang up and told me you was arrested by FSB crying to me.</p>

<p>Every one bought and believed that. Might have to make the tabor thing bullshit to avoid it unraveling.</p>
