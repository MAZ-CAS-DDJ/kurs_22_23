<p>Welcome. Personally, my idea consists of this, so forgive me if i am sounding messy or my message looks messy. In the Filipino context, that means we Filipinos will preserve national values (respect to elders, love of country and so on) and take good parts of Filipino character (discard bad ideas like total hospitality, love for USA, too many) while taking the good things from socialism (how socialists do it), and discard bad things (namely internationalism, disregard for labor, class wars, liberal democracy). While at the same time, we take some ideas from socialism, though not western socialism (especially not the liberal style socialism), but DPRK style Socialism (Philippines and DPRK are small countries, and the DPRK did well before 1995) or at least our own Socialism, even if deaths arise from mistakes done (the USSR rose in a few years with their industrial revolution with equal casualties compared to the west, A. Slavros said it in some webpage in DA). If it goes bad, then we Filipinos could take corporatism/syndicalism.</p>
<p>Remember that J. A. Primo De Rivera said</p>
<p>"Fascism was born to inspire a faith not of the Right (which at bottom aspires to conserve everything, even injustice) or of the Left (which at bottom aspires to destroy everything, even goodness)"</p>
<p>In the case of the DPRK, it kept the good parts of Korean character, like love for country and love for parents, not to mention you dont see skimpy women in Pyongyang and very little liberal degeneration or none at all. They (Kims and WPK) kept Korean values (love for parents, country and so on), but removed the bad characteristics from the previous colonial era/South Korea and Joseon Dynasty, like injustice, ignoring the people's pleas to save their Korea, writing in Hanja (many Koreans then and now use less Chinese letters, only the aristocracy can write Hanja as if it's nothing.) or worse, sucking up to Japan/USA, and took the best of socialism or made up their own concepts for their Juche (Autarky). </p>
<p>In short, we keep the good values of the right (love for country, elders, working hard) and and left (coopreation, mass mobilization, everyone working and so on). A true conservative will accept the social conservatism prevailing in a socialist country, a fake one will despise a socialist state with right wing characters (like the DPRK), mainly because its socialist. </p>
<p>As for the ideal Filipino State...</p>
<p>Ideal State? Good question. </p>
<p>In my case, the Philippines, it would mean big things.</p>
<p>First of all, ties to the colonizers will be lessened/eliminated, and more ties of friendship to oppressed countries and enemies of liberalism (DPRK, Vietnam, Russia, Iran, Syria, Zimbabwe, and so on, and possibly in the future, TotalitarianSocialist's Volkstaat). China will be considered as a neighbor, and Spratlys islands cannot be owned by Chinese alone. Us southeast Asians will own the islands, respectively going to any island's nearest country.</p>
<p>Crime shall be solved with Gulag systems around the country.(it isn't bad at all) Death Penalty and Penal battalions (labor and military alike) will be established. Corrupt officials and nasty criminals (rapists, pedophiles, traitors), will be punished by severity. Lowest punishment is jailtime or labor, highest is public execution and/or public torture.</p>
<p>Culture shall be given a big boost. Music/other media shall have Filipino characteristics. One can still watch/listen to foreign stuff, since such media could be used as an inspiration to make our own. New forms shall be encouraged as long as it has Pro-state/pro-Filipino/pro labor themes. Removing Colonial characteristics is a must.</p>
<p>Immigration is ok for foreigners and Filipinos alike, as long as foreigners will obey our rules, and Filipinos will do the same thing in other countries. Those who have skills shall not be allowed to go out to the country for jobs, nor shall the unskilled. Filipinos will only go as respectful and considerate tourists. Foreigners in my country can stay indefenitely/have a Filipino wife, provide they behave nicely.</p>
<p>Military shall be given a big boost too. It shall be on the top priority (Songun, fcuk yeah!). Muslim rebels/communist rebels/private armies will be eliminated. Guns taken from the enemy shall be given to loyal persons and to veterans. State intelligence and Organizations for the state and nation shall be given top prority. Equipment will come from our own people's hands or from newly found allies. </p>
<p>Economy shall either be State Socialism, Juche, Syndicalism, Corporatism (not like what fascap says), or a hybrid of all 4, with considerations to my country, so it would both be nation wide, and all islands given priority. Since we have debts, the debts from the us government/many anti filipino states can go to hell. Labor shall be given a boost, with medals for those who work a lot. </p>
<p>Religion shall have no priority in the state. There are muslim Filipinos and others, so no religion shall be given a damn. We will only worship our state, our heroes from the past, the leaders, and our nation as a whole. They can keep their religions, as long as they give priority to the state and to the leaders.</p>
<p>The rich shall be allowed to stay, as long as they obey the government, and support the people. Middle class, same thing and rules. Those who do leave and side with the enemy shall be assasinated. and lots of Filipinos work for the US government, so they will have persona non grata for status, and the name "race traitor". They go back to serve the country, good. If they are oppositionists, they go to labor.</p>
<p>Population control shall be given a big boost. The churchmen/imams shall be silent, lest they find themselves in the Gulag for racial treason. Abortion is a yes, for rape victims, pre-21 y.o. mothers or mothers who might die. Parenting Licences shall be issued to those with good genes and merit, and shall be checked for behavior towards children, and their children as well.</p>
<p>The language shall have big boosts as well, using local terminology or self made terminology, and to modify it for everyday and formal use alike. Dialects can be used, but giving priority to State Language (filipino) is a big yes. </p>
<p>The system of government is a one-party state. Opposition shall be destroyed polite. Autonomous regions shall be dismantled, and all citizens of it shall be considered as Filipinos. </p>
<p>Tribal persons shall be considered Filipino citizens, and we shall look upon their character. </p>
<p>All natural resources shall be government property. Refusal to give it to the state shall have Katyusha or scuds planted in their so-called turf, especially if they are mistreating the workers and the locals alike. </p>
<p>Values shall be kept, indecency frowned upon (Filipinos will wear Barong Tagalog/Mao Suit/what the North Koreans wear, since DPRK people wear nicely.), and social conservatism shall be a big must. </p>
