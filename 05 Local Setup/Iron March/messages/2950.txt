<p>I notice you "like" many of my posts or try to defend me in debates. I'm not sure why, considering I seem to diligently shoot myself in the foot on many (or perhaps most) occasions.</p>
<p>I'm probably a pariah on this site. Or it is assumed I'm JIDF.... I should be focusing on work or real activism when I'm not working. This is mainly because of my work move to America it was something to do and all my NS friends are back home... In Germany, most of us are scared to go to sites not approved of.</p>
