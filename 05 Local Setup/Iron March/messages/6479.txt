<p>The 'Generation Identity' brand is too Continental, too commercial, to thrive in England. However, Identitarianism as a broader doctrine can flourish and would undoubtedly, if presented in an intelligent manner, appeal to much of the youth who are currently lost at sea. The points which you have listed in your topic are perfectly in sync with my own thinking; especially the one concerning the bourgeoisie. If we were to declare an <i>Identitarian </i>group of some sort, I'm sure we could make something of it. The use of the lambda could still be retained, but should be used alongside our own aesthetics. You've mentioned your fondness of Evolian Traditionalism, in this light I believe Anglo-Saxondom to be a true treasure trove for English movements; its folkish ethos, its untapped myths and Germanic asceticism (and fatalism) would make for a perfect marriage with traditionalist thinking. </p>

<p>Previous attempts to establish Generation Identity groups throughout the country were wrong to endorse the House of Windsor, and merely offered a sort of youthful conservatism to those who would listen. The minds behind these attempts failed to recognise that our 'movement' is as much opposed to the Old Right as it is to the general Left. We must shock the middle-classes, we must outmaneuver any and every attempt made by the establishment to categorise us. We must breathe fresh air into the rotten carcass of the failed unitary-state.</p>

<p>We should, like Alain de Benoist, come to use Left-wing ideas in the name of Right-wing principles.</p>
