<p>The facebook page is something i've been considering doing for a while, look for it within the next few days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've never been on Twitter and am not that familiar with it, but if you think the effort would be worthwile it might be something to look into.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As far as the American members go your suspicions are probably correct. I have been contacted by a few Americans who were interested, but I don't know for sure whether they've joined or not. To a large degree this is understandable given the lack of historical Fascism here in the states and the propaganda of the NBU being primarily aimed at a British audience. When the NBU does start to gain publicity in Britain there will be spill over on this side of the Atlantic and I'm convinced at that point membership will pick up. Our challenge in the meantime is to make sure we have the organizational leadership and structure to take advantage of the opportunity. I don't know of any active members that participate here on Iron March. Most of the members here don't consider the NBU anti-semitic or racist enough to garner respect. I prefer to stick around here though and fight the good fight. i'm stubborn in that way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wouldn't waste your time on Stormfront. They're so obsessed with race they don't realize that even if you got rid of every non-white here and in Europe the problems which caused the muliticultural issue we currently have would still be here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The only Fascist figure people here in the states are familiar with is Hitler, and only in respect to his policies towards Jews. I think we should take up the job of what I try and do on my personal Facebook page and educate people on the wide variety of Fascist thought that has been passed down through the years, not only Moseley, but Codreanu, Mussolini, Primo Rivera, Evola and many others. This is not going to be easy there's lots of educating to do, we're just going to have to be patient.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now that I think about it your title might be divisional officer, i'm not quite sure since you'd be the only other officer here in the states. And I'm sure we could use whatever email you desire on the webpage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'll give you some recommendations on Mussolini tommorow. For now I've got to get some sleep.</p>

<p>FB - looking forward to seeing this development from you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Twitter - once the fb page is set-up, assuming you are structuring it as a page as opposed to a group, then one can open a Twitter account, which is straightforward and from memory takes around 5-10 mins, if that, and, as part of the process, one is able to link new threads/posts on fb to automatically "tweet" and those "tweets" link back to the fb page for the full information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Membership - all noted and understood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stormfront - will ignore.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fascist figures &amp; ideals - I understand.  I have been reading your fb page and links you have picked for it: I have just finished reading the 2nd. post from Counter-Currents books with translations of Bardeche . 'til the past couple of years, much of my reading has focused on English/British history, chiefly 13th C. - 17th C., taking that country through the Dark Ages to the evolution of parliament to the Divine Right of Kings, Cromwell and the restitution of the monarchy; Eng lit classics; Shakespeare &amp; Shaw but I will catch up your help!   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Racism - I do think I need to remind you while a fascist at heart, I do have Nat. Soc. tendencies on this specific aspect. Race though is a minor sub-section of the panoply of fascism and, for the NBU and elsewhere I will throttle back on the subject: I have to do it for work anyway!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NBU Officer - I will let you &amp; Gary work it out and in non-core countries for the NBU adjustments in organization and approach may be necessary.  The first of your 2 pieces by Bardeche refer the difficulties of transplanting one specific national fascist cause in another nation.</p>
