	That is workable, it depends just how serious you are in setting things up.

	When we started <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> I didn't really have any more than a few IM guys to lean on at well, like one in scotland, one up north, one in London, etc - not exactly many. You have to look outwards for more people.

	I suggest you get on TRS there is a canadian pool party thread - a couple from BC though those could be the same guys and knowing them nationally is a good idea. Less emphasis on starting an organisation but on networking. If you can get them to talk on skype etc. I assume you are already investigating this. Discuss activity but without specifying the group there is probablyaÂ  lot of generic stuff you all agree on.

	What else is there. Oh you know what, I fucking bet that the North West Front has a few guys in BC.

	Fuck knows what any of these people are going to be like.

	It is really about getting as many contacts and leads as possible and following that up with something to offer them or convincing others to take action.
