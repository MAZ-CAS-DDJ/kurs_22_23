<p>Even the old Klan were not just "lynch dem nigger" types, it just happened that they had to. The Klan did have some support from niggers too. The lynchings under slavery and in the days of the Klan are blown way out of proportion. Blacks used to be clean cut and atleast respectable, dumb almost in a younger brother kind of way - we didn't hold it against them. But I suppose having a separate water fountain was more evil than forced integration in a society which they cannot match up to, which holds different standards, and nobody wishes them to.</p>
