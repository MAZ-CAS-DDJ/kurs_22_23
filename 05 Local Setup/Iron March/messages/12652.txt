<p>Not to be a nuisance, but would you be able to explain to me the dynamics and conflicts of certain groups in Ukraine. I saw you were discussing the Russian National Unity party and was wondering what their views points and goals are with Ukraine, I know one is Pan-Slavism. Also what is their feelings towards Azov and other Fascists and National Socialists groups in Ukraine. Finally which group do you believe is best to hold power within Ukraine. Apologies if any of these questions are redundant but I was just interested to get your take as you are a much more educated on that region than I am.</p>
