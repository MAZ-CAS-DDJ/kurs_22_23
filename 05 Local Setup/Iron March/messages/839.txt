I have never read the book, so I can not be sure how accurate the Wiki article is. I can see the differences though. To be quite honest, I have always liked the idea of a German+Russian alliance against the decadent west (which could have been possible under Strasser in his early years), but I dislike that the other European nations (especially Britain "being totally cut off") not being allowed to join a united Europe. Then again, I suppose Britain wouldn't concern me personally (not even having a shred of British heritage).<p>As for the Atlantic nations, I am not too concerned. I do not know how you feel about your own Canadian nation, but I identify more with my own European heritage (I hate Americanism) than I do with my American "citizenship". It seems like Eurasianism would be the perfect movement to support seeing as how it would break America up along ethnic lines (which is what I think should be done anyway).</p>

<p>I identify fairly strongly with Canada, and I think an ethnically fractured North America would essentially be totally under the heel of the Eurasian countries. A multipolar world where Atlantic nations get back in touch with their European heritage? Marvelous. A multipolar world where tiny racial communes do what Moscow or Berlin tells them? As a nationalist I don't think so.</p>

This last year has been an immense ideological transformation for me and I think that is what makes the people on SP suspicious of me. Up until the end of may last year I was the most ardent Hitlerite you could imagine, even getting into esoteric Hitlerism and nonsense about Hitler being the "kalki avatar". After my departure from SF and the reactionary scene I began swinging toward orthodox Marxism when it just didn't feel right - than I arrived at Strasserism/Conservative Revolutionary when I almost thought I would take Southgate's path toward NA I swung back around full circle and found solace in Dugin and National Bolshevism. I have learned more this year than I have in the past 2 that is for sure and I think I am stuck at NB.<p>Anyway sorry for the rant, but yea you will probably see my new intro thread.</p>
