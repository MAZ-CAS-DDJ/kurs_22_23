<p>Yeah that certainly reminds me of the zentropista/zentropaville/sexorcismo memes (which is good), i was quite amused the other week when i finally got around to watching Apocalypse Now and finally catching where that phrase came from.  <br /><br />The thing about relying on the vector graphic process too heavily is that somewhere in the process lines lose alot of style..  Often the character of the individual lines need tweaking to really make it pop.  Like what some were saying about the Codreanu image in the User Content thread, that his facial features were distorted enough to not really convey the gravity of his character.<br /><br />The thing about zazzle is its the least hip.  We want some degree of "boutique", for lack of a better word.<br /><br />I have a few thoughts on the above image.  Cowabunga makes me think of Ninja Turtles, does it reference much else?   I would tweak the details of that skull to refine it, make it more iconic, make it pop.  Maybe use an accurate silhouette of an arditi or a specific nsdap dagger like that of the hitler youth?<br /><br />I did just now catch that he is throwing a salute, and that is quite amusing.<br /><br />i tried adding you on skype yesterday, idk if you use that much.  </p>
