<p>Yes, the edited out part. Ben wants to keep it out of the public view so this is being kept to private messages, skype and whatnot. He's not just being charged with nazi stuff, they confiscated his devices and then told him after a few hours that they had 'found' pictures of obscene filth involving children on them.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to God that they're just trying to scare him, but I wouldn't put planting evidence beyond them. If it was just nazi stuff, he could go out on bail, do a short bit of time (or pay a fine) and make friends, but with this, they could send him to prison for a long time and that kind of charge doesn't make you many friends.</p>
