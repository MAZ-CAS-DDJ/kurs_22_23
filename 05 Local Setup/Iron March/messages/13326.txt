	Ok, thanks I might change my username.
</p>

<p>
	In hindsight it was a stupid idea, as I use this name on TRS as well as Disqus.
</p>

<p>
	I have to wonder though, was it a deliberate decision to let Google index this forum?
</p>

<p>
	Don't know if it's a good idea, unless the reason is attracting new users.
</p>

<p>
	But I think users generally sign up after being directed here by word of mouth..
</p>

<p>
	Anyways, I'd appreciate it if you could "retract" my introductory post if somehow possible!
</p>

<p>
	Cheers
