<p>Does North Carolina have any NS or WN movements that are good? I have another comrade that lives there, that feels very politically isolated. He goes by 'EuropaRising' on the forum, and he's apart of the same organisation with me, we've been hoping to find others from NC to network with our member, because finding like minded individuals in North Carolina is extremely hard according to him. </p>
