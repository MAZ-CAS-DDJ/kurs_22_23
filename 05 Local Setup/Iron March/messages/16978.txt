	I do not even know what the Texas chapter is sir.  That post was afew weeks back. Can you remind me? Also if I can't meet face to face. the answer is no. I am not interested in keyboard warriors, or being  card carrying member, or forming a new group. We are already creating an Structured Folkish Heathen (Odinist) chapter here in Houston.

	I do not mean any disrespect. I have just been at this game since 1990 and i left before out of disgust as most people I met that were proud of their race, were proud because they had nothing else to be proud of in their lives. No Mental Strenght only blind hate.   I loath Beer nazi's as I call them.
