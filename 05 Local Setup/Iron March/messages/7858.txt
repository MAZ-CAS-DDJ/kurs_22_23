<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I was impressed by the thread, and was wondering something. Race.</p>
<p>I'm from Puerto Rico, racially I am white but my family has a tiny amount of Berber admixture, and as such I don't look 100% white, most people think I look Italian.</p>
<p>The point is, we are obviously white, (my mother is a natural blonde, my cousins are pale red heads with green eyes, my grandfather was a German speaking blue eyed man, etc) </p>
<p>But because I don't look 100% white, and my name is Spanish, people automatically assume I'm some indian. </p>
<p>My point is, I am a fascist, and I am not tolerant of non-european cultures, etc, etc.</p>
<p>So theoretically, if in the US there were a Fascist revolution, or a civil war with different factions including a fascist one, would it inevitably lead to a merge with Skinheads/Neo-Nazis/White Nationalists?</p>
<p>So how would someone like me fare, because I would pick up a rifle and have no problem fighting for a fascist goal, and form a fascist nation.</p>
