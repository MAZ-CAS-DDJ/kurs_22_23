	Alex,
</p>

<p>
	I don't really know what is going on with Atomwaffen, but if things go south and AW falls apart please do not forget about Reaction. We are currently taking in former AW members and are preparing to go public soon.
</p>

<p>
	We are going to burn a Mexican flag at the next Trump rally in front of news cameras, with our flag and everything. So far we have 11 guys going, with full Black Bloc clothing, skull masks and everything. AW has honestly not done anything besides flyers (we are trying to hit UC Irvine tonight) but we are ready for actual demonstrations.
</p>

<p>
	I think Reaction is the future of the American National Socialist movement, and I pray that you keep us in mind. Please do not let the movement fragment into multiple competing groups, (Reaction, AW remnants, Silver Legion). If you would consider giving us a subforum or at least directing people towards us I would really appreciate it.
