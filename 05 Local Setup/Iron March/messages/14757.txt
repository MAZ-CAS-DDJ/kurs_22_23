	I used to think paganism was cool but lately I've been more into cosmic order and truth as a natural spiritual force less emphasis on the names of deities as sentient beings more on the concept of s force ( to quote Starwars) as the cosmic order and truth it seems more likely than multiple spiritual beings or an all knowing and loving Abrahamic god.
