<p>Well, it is something like that, but Kemalists themselves don't really know what they really want.</p>
<p>They don't know what they believe. They claim to be left while claiming to be nationalist at the same time.</p>
<p>The opposing side, on the other hand, are the same as the "Kemalist" rabble, they too know not what they want or why they want it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Its really complicated, but the reason and the solution is simple. The reason why this came to be was due to a destruction of the national consciousness, the elimination of national goals.</p>
<p>This was done in order to better polarize the political climate in Turkey, by claiming that the people who lived in the central areas, who were more conservative were "Islamists" who wanted to destroy the freedoms of others, and by claiming that people that lived in coastal and urban regions, who were less conservative, yet still adhered to our customs and beliefs, as atheist, moralless people who wanted to turn Turkey into a state where there is nothing sacred.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, how is the political climate in Greece nowadays?</p>
