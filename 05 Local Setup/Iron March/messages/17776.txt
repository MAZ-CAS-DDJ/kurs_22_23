	"Brother blackshirts, my comrades in the struggle:
</p>

<p>
	Our fight is for the soul, and in that battle we go for - ward together until victory be won. Our struggle is hard, because we are fighting for something great, and great things are not lightly or easily gained. We are fighting for nothing less than a revolution in the spirit of our people. We must be worthy of our mission.<br />
	For blackshirts are those who are summoned to lead the people to a new and a higher civilization. The blackshirt is a revolutionary dedicated to the service of our country, who must always possess the character of the true revolution.
</p>

<p>
	It is not the character you observe in the little men of the old parties, blown hither and thither by every gust of transient convenience, elated by little success, downcast by little failure, gossiping and chattering about the prospects of the next five minutes, forward in place, but not so forward in service. Without loyalty, endurance, or staying power. Such a character is the hallmark of financial democratic politics. It is the opposite of the National Socialism.<br />
	In the true revolutionary, the first quality is the power to endure. Constancy, loyalty to cause and comrades, manhood and stability of nature. These are the qualities of the true revolutionary. In our movement, that great character has been reborn, and for that reason we carry within us destiny. We care not whether we win tomorrow morning or at the end of a lifetime of labor and struggle. For to us, the little calculations of the little men mean nothing.<br />
	All we care is that win we will because no power on earth can hold down the will within us. Struggles we have had and will have. Blows we have taken and will again. Victories we have had and will have again. Through good and ill we march on, till victory be won, for this is the character of the true revolutionary.<br />
	In the great moments of supreme struggle and decision, it is easy to hold that character -- even in supreme sacrifice. It is not so easy in the hard and daily task.
</p>

<p>
	It is then even more than in the great fights we have together that I would like to be the companion of every one of you. I would like to be with every action team that carries the message of our new faith to new streets. I would like to be with every man or woman doing the hard but vital job of giving leadership to the people in the block of houses for which they are responsible.<br />
	For these are the jobs that come, by the dedication of thousands to the mission of leading people in their homes and streets, revolution is won.<br />
	In that task I cannot in body be with every one of you every day. But in spirit I am with you always. Together we have let a flame that the ages shall not extinguish. Guard that sacred flame my brother black - shirts until it illumines, and lights again the path of mankind.-" Open letter to the white man, written by a anonymous Black Shirt

	<strong>According to the Blackshirts</strong>, winning matters &amp; not fucking playing by the rules. With thousands working towards that goal &amp; a small base of support. You can't win by playing by the rules. It doesn't happen in the US because the system stamps out any opposition when it becomes a credible threat, it gets discredited, leaders get killed (Rockwell), people disappear, organisations get infiltrated by informants, &amp; because of widespread apathy:
</p>

<p>
	-Since a mass movement cannot be “pulled off” in America because of the antimass movement nature of the American people (Which stems from their evergrowing apathy), the only recourse for the National Socialist Revolutionaries is to go underground and build their own armed struggle to wage war against the State. National Socialist activities have never produced one significant political results in the U.S.A. Any mob resistance our people have ever been engaged in has always been a spontaneous eruption (like Boston) with the participation and agitation of no political party or National Socialist activist. They did it themselves and without our help... The Party with their stagnant Prussia tactics were incapable of identifying with the revolutionary youth. Special propaganda and mass organizing [of revolutionary youth] did not occur... - Building the revolutionary party, by Joseph Tommasi

	Popular base support does become more important later on in the struggle but it will also be easier to achieve that support as the govt gets more weakened, inept &amp; economic conditions get worse.
