	The last set of principles are Fascist/Natsoc, they are technically traditionalist as well since respecting the Tradition is to respect the truth - its all part of the same Worldview. That is Natural Collectives (personal, family, ethnic, racial, gender and human), Common Good (typically explained under Prussian ethical socialism), Great Goals and finally Meritocracy (which I would say is part of Hierarchy but you can explain it separately too). This means that in total theres 10 principles or 11 if we count authority and/or dominion, legitimacy, sovereignty and independence together as its own principle (which is fine - since you need those together to form authority or political units). Finally theres 1 extra element that I wouldn't call a traditionalist principle, its about action that works to realize a Worldview and solve problems in innovative ways depending on the temporal circumstances - histiorical-cultural and prevailing attitudes or social positions of key groups or individuals and that is Dynamism. One aspect of Dynamism that is eternal is the Laws of Power - which anyone must heed outlined in Imperium by Yockey. Â
