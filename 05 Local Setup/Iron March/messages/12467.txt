<p>Yo so it's taken me a lot longer to do this than I thought it would. it's pretty much done except a few small bits that need re-recording. I've uploaded a couple of clips onto sound cloud though.</p>

<p>It's not perfect and being a bit of a perfectionist I'm not entirely happy but I think it's good enough. I've done the best I could with my set-up, mic and mastering skills which have improved quite a bit so I may well re-do the entire thing in the future. The full thing will be heading your way as soon as possible.</p>
