<p>William,</p>
<p>It seems that I am not quite familiar with how IRC works. I'm trying to find some sort of alternative to Skype, as the last time I tried to download the program my computer had the equivalent of a stroke. But I have no idea how to set up a channel or anything. Assistance would be heavily appreciated.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Dux</p>
