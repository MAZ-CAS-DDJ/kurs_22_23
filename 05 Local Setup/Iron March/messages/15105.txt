	Hey Rostislav,
</p>

<p>
	This is Blackshirt 13 here. I was just wondering if you are into neofolk and martial industrial? I am also writing because I heard that the martial industrial scene/music and neofolk is pretty active in Germany? Just wanted to see if this was true. Also, if so do the artists preform a lot and where? Let me know if you get this.

<p>
	Hail,
