			I'm not too proud about the Integralists, more now than ever as the 'new' movement is very ridiculous, but it was the main form of Fascism we had here, but it was not tailored after the many folks and cultures we have here in Brazil - instead, it celebrated an inexistent "Brazilian" culture.

	I have read somewhere that their main goal was to actually create a Brazilian culture by mixing everybody within the borders and by that breeding a 'Brazilian type'. That's bizarre and not exactly in line with Traditionalism, but I kinda like it as a strange face of Fascism. Also, I was talking about this movement with another guy as well and I came to the conclusion that if we acknowledge the triune hierarchy of Spirit, soul and body, than it could be logical that mixing with somebody who is on the same spiritual level as you, but from another race is more acceptable than vice versa. (It could be though that this applies only to other nations, but not races, according to other Fascists.) What do you think?
