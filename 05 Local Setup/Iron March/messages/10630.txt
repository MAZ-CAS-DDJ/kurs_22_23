<p>G'day m88,</p>
<p>Just inquiring about your sticker manufacturer, looked into it a bit, and around me I can't seem to find any cheap and decent places to make politically incorrect stickers. I want to get some Aussie IM ones done up, if the mob you get yours done with have a website than it would be much appreciated if you could give us the address, or if you know of any other establishments, than that'd be a great help.</p>
<p>Cheers </p>
<p>Tom</p>
