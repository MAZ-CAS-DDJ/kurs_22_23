	Oh, if you're talking "organized crime" instead of street gangs: where I'm from that's Triads, Yakuza, "Russian" (multiethnic) mafiya. That's pretty much the case in the Bay Area as well, with less ex-Soviet syndicates, way more Triad activity, and a tiny bit of Mexican Mafia stuff.<br /><br />
	Also, it kind of doesn't? But we do have a common identity over our regions, which has held us together. Demographic changes are making that harder to maintain though. So like, Cascadia/the PNW is fine being America, but would also one of the first regions to break off if things got really bad.
