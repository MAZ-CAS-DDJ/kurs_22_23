	Lol, it feels like I'm speaking to a mirror here. :D

	Awesome, so you're young too. Are you still a student? I'm a computer science major, 2nd year in college. My plan is to go into software development later. What about you?

	By the way, even here in the US, there's an active but small Kurdish community. Don't you have that in Holland too? Families, friends, basically anyone who could help you re-learn Kurdish alongside the online material you'll be needing. Because again, as a fascist Kurd you really need to re-learn your mother tongue and reconnect with your homeland. Your knowledge just can't go to waste.

	Also, what are your general skills? Anything counts, like what languages you know, what work you do or wanna do, what hobbies or interests you have, etc etc. For example: I know 2 languages (English and Kurdish, with a bit of Arabic), I can make posters and artwork, I can make music (play the piano), I can code, I'm good at writing, and I'm interested in hiking and other nature-based activities.

	Yeah, from reading your comments I got the impression that we went through a similar path. I'm from Bashur myself, and what the capitalists have done there disgusts me to no end. But then I look at what's happening in Rojava, and the degenerate society that the communists are creating over there, where Kurdish kids are being taught that Arabs and Turks are our "brothers," and I'm filled with the need for action because these two groups are utterly destroying the Kurdish nation. They're both just as bad as each other. There's really no answer to our problems other than National Socialism, since it's pretty much the one Truth that unifies everything.

	Interesting that you bring up the Koreas, since we're basically facing the same problem: the capitalist south (Bashur) split up against the communist north (Bakur), and all of this on the backdrop of the global geopolitical situation. I've actually analyzed the two Koreas as well, and my own conclusion has been that South Korea is only slightly better than the North (as opposed to the common misconception that the North is literally hell and the South is heaven). But of course, the best would be a National Socialist fusion (basically what Hitler created in Germany). Are you familiar with Evola and his ideas about the traditional Aryan hierarchy and divine order and all that? I'd love to discuss our conception of what the ideal Kurdistan would be like on its various levels and aspects.
