<p>Hey mate sorry for the late reply, hi days have been hectic...too much fun! Happy new year anyway mate! Well it's probably just the old white nationalist intolerance shining through...</p>
<p>Difference between us and the old Germans is that the japs or Turks they allied with weren't invading Germany, it's safe to say if those old boys were around now they'd be pretty intolerant towards them...but hey it is the 21st century and we need to adapt. </p>
<p>IM had sort of changed my stance about a lot of things...Albany is staunchly white, saw my first African when I was 13-14 and first Muslim when I was 12, so I notice the demographic displacement in Perth a lot more than others, always grew up around filos, they are usually quite good workers, friendly and respectful....they have good family values too, that easy assimilation is quite frightening as blood assimilation doesn't come much later...</p>
<p>I find when I'm in Perth that the immigrant population is quite the opposite...rude and oblivious to the host population plus they look sickly....I guess a product of dwelling forever in the metropolitan regions..</p>
<p>Miners are good value, we see the displacement of our workforce by imported labor more than any other trade here in Western Australia, Economically our trades/ minng/construction would sympathise with nationalism. </p>
<p>I'd get booted offsite if I flyred up camp, all this Islamic terrorism is piping up the old national fervour a bit down here, I must say I was a little enthusiastic about the Sydney happening...didn't play out as I expected. </p>
<p>I'd love to do that mate, I agree with you when you said that activism doesn't have to be backed up totally with an organisation, autonomous activism is a brilliant tactic. I like what nordfront does with tarps, been throwing up making a few and putting them up around the place <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> I can see the potential for graffiti tactic in Perth aswell...</p>
<p>Also cool to see the Aussie fash thread getting used, we need a section to discuss our situation down here which I think is quite unique, I don't see australia gone like America...I don't think we necessarily need to destroy anything and rebuild...our folk is a lot better off than other nations, our mindset and youth have potential still...not all is lost but I've come disparaged a lot with big tent...I dunno, anyway buy yourself a kettle bell and look up the various workouts for them, good muscle building/strength training + Muay Thai which gyms for in Perth are everywhere...works for me m8.</p>
