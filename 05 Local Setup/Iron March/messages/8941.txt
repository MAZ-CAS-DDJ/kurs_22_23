<p>Yeah I don't have the build to pull that one off(yet). I just usually wear band shirts and the like.  I can't go blatant cause I can get kicked out of college or fired from my job.  But I wore this in class and talked about Rockwell. Nobody caught onto anything. I'm either really subtle or they are just all very dumb. </p>

<p>I would say 70% of the time most people are too stupid to understand the meaning behind the shirt. They might see it as racist, but that's about as far as it gets. Multikult has gotten too warped into people's minds nowadays for them to even understand a simple message.</p>

<p>I wore that shirt to school lol. I got suspended but it was worth it to see all the nogs get pissed. I mean I don't dress full on skinhead (boots, braces, whole nine) but I still wear buttons, pins, RAC band shirts, 88 shirts, and other "racist" imagery.    </p>
