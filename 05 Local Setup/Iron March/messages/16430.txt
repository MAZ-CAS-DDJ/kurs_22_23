	Well you won't be gassed immediately. You will be given warnings and if you ignore them then you will be sent to the concentration camp where you will be restricted to only post in the showers of which trolls and stuff usually get put into. Being gassed is the ultimate restriction applied to an account here so it isn't the easiest thing to do. Don't worry about it, just don't act too stupidly and nothing will happen. Due to the way fascism is structured the reason fascists focus on them is because we see them as an enemy to a better society under good values.Â
