<p>Heb 1:5 discounts Jesus as ever having been an angel of any sort</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"For to which of the angels did he say at any time, "You are my Son. Today have I become your father?" and again, "I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son?""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm sure you'll do well brother, keep to the narrow path.</p>
