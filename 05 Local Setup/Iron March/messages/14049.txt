	Well that's what will eventually happen. Shit is going to hit the fan one day. Maybe in 5 years, maybe in 10, but some day soon, probably sooner rather than later. And I'm hoping I can gain some skills and knowledge that could help when that day comes. Hopefully the military might provide that. But yeah I would never risk my life for any bureaucratic bullshit or fight in a war I oppose.
