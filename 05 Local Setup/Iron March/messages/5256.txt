<p>Dear Sir Parrott of the Knights of Avalon</p>
<p>I am but a humble Shintoist/Buddhist East Aryan hailing from the land of the rising sun. I can trace my lineage to the famous Samurai Sanada Yukimura and I hope to be a warrior just like him, adept at the art of war as well as that of peace. I am currently studying for a college degree in the United States and my curiosity was piqued by your organization. I would like to settle your kingdom in martial spirit in order to help develop it. Would it be possible for me to become an Avalonian Knight so I can assist in your most noble cause?</p>
<p>I am however, concerned about the theological aspects of such an arrangement. Is it possible for me to keep my traditional Shinotist gods and buddhist practices while at the same time practicing Orthodoxy? Would your Orthodox god allow it to be worshipped alongside my ancestors? Does he recognize the late divinity of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor?</p>
<p>Thank you very much, hope to see you in knighthood</p>
