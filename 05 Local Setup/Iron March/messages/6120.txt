<p>Sadly. I went to walmart and aldis today to get food. It amazes me how people act these days. I just about got ran over by some obese woman, while I was in a pedestrian right of way zone. I seen about 5 different guys that I swear HAD to be gay, a few lesbians, and lots of unattended children. And the rural areas are supposed to be better. Okay. Whatever. How is it where you live?</p>
