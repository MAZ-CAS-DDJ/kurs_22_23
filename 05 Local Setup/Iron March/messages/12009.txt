<p>I'm not talking to them about anything I can figure things out for myself , I don't really think they have a grasp on the things they study either, yeah they have plenty of time to talk to teenage boys on the internet......................................................</p>

<p>Esoteric is a dumb word to describe these teachings it means within , I mean we aren't using to correctly as it was mean't everyone around here , Including myself has been guilty of not understanding the meaning behind the knowledge they study and procure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I would much rather use the term occult because let's face it that's what we want, some occult  power to dictate to us a forbidden knowledge to lift us up above the rest of the squalid blind ignorant writhing fools , that make up the entire world. Occult meaning hidden which I'm sure you know , hidden so that only the worthy may recover.</p>

<p>Slavros's whole platform is based on inner conflict I knew it didn't seem right, but after I found out he was of multiracial origin it makes perfect sense, His entire ideology is an identity crisis projected onto a website.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Think about it remember his pyramid diagram, As above so below, whatever well in that paragraph he goes on to say that , people of multiracial origin should be killed etc. etc. Another odd thing is that he tries to reconcile his edgy communist stalinist youth with Nazism which quite frankly just can't be done , there is no way Russians or most slavs for that matter could fit into that particular ideology without twisting and warping it from its original viewpoint. Hitler was indeed esoteric and had a divine message, however I think Evola just muddled it up and confused it with late 19th century mysticism and pseudo-science.</p>

<p>The one thing I agree with on this website is that the world we live in is utter shit , no worse than shit , I want to know if we are destined to live here or if we are destined to change it to fight it or if destiny is an empty invisible structure in our minds and we are screaming into an empty blackness. That is why i must study the occult to know the spirit world I read books I took notes I alone can decide what is real in my mind and what is false. We must do something but Ironmarch is not the answering just the park where a bunch of strangers meet up with the same empty blackness inside of them.</p>
