	No, it didn´t. I started to sexual dreams, once girl i like, then some woman propably over 50 that i would´t ever fuck and it was every night something like that. I was even dreaming about watching porn. I googled meaning of dreams...and i found out it was succubus ( i´m really happy, that it haven´t attacked physically. But it propably would, if i haven´t prayed). I was propably infected, because watching porn and jerking off often(back in time, when i was degenerate).
