<p>The system is so hypocritical it doesn't matter. Leftists always whine about right wing violence, but when they do it, it is never a problem or stain on their record. The Right has for the most part been commited to pacifism and democracy, and that weakness has been exploited by the left.</p>
<p>I don't think violence repels people. it makes you look stronger so it is a good thing; people always decry the nazis but when the killing starts they are going to want the killers to be on their side. I am not promoting violence, though I promote political militarism, but violence is something that will happen. Bomb attacks, media personalities knifed on their way home,  fat ugly lesbian MPs having their heads bludgioned to a pulp by sledge hammers - all this will be perpetrated by their VICTIMS and so they will only have themselves to blame.</p>
<p>Revolutionary violence will only come in the form of the armed forces turning on the system and that will be a very short fight. There will be a crisis and alot of people will die, all enemies of the nation will have to go. that isn't a problem. It is innevitable. And there isn't anything you can do about it either way.</p>
