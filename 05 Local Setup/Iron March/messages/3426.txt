<p>Well, have you seen the Faith table in the Glorantha RPG?</p>
<p>It works with percentages. For example, if you have a 35% chance to do something, you ought to roll between 1 and 35, otherwise your roll is considered a failure. Do you have a Skype maybe? It would be much better to discuss about it on an instant messenger.</p>
