<p>Hey there. To answer your question, your best bet is to look at schools that have the most industry credibility. What I mean by that is, which schools do you usually see popping up in the resumes of successful animators, illustrators, concept artists, comic artists, etc. For several years I tried to get into art school and could only manage to get chump-change for financial aid (<em>I wasn't poor enough to qualify, or rich enough to afford it on my own</em>), so I gave up and went into working in the comic industry full time without a degree. Then I suddenly ran away and joined the circus with the big green camouflage tent... But that's another story.</p>
<p>From what I learned, the schools in the US that I see in a lot of big artist's resumes are the following:</p>
<p>Art Center of Pasadena</p>
<p>CalArts</p>
<p>Rhode Island School of Design</p>
<p>Pratt Institute of the Arts</p>
<p>Ringling School of Design</p>
<p>The Art Department (TAD. They have a location in Texas, and one in Richmond, VA)</p>
<p>Virginia Commonwealth University (<em>in Richmond VA. This is where I intend to go, since it's a state school and will be easier to afford on the GI Bill, while still being among the top 10 highest rated art schools in the country</em>)</p>
<p>Every school varies a little, but almost all of them will be hysterically liberal. So naturally, expect loads and loads of idiocy. Try to have fun with it though. Trolling college liberals can be a great time, especially if you're older and more experienced than them. But ultimately, you're there to learn and better yourself. Every school has its shortcomings, and 90% of what you get out of it is what you put into it yourself. You can go to an awesome top-notch school where all the big studios hire from, and still graduate as a mediocre artist if you only do the bare minimum and never push yourself. Likewise, I've seen people who went to small schools I never heard of with questionable credibility and were amazing artists.</p>
