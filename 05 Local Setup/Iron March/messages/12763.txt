<p>Yep. GCSEs coming up sooner than I can deal with. You have any exams coming up? That sounds lovely! Do you celebrate both the equinox and Easter? And nice new icon. The angry dwarf definitely goes with your ideology. My favourite thing about the format so far is that I'm finally able to upload that pic of Unity Mitford I planned ages ago.<br /><br />
Wasn't being sarcastic about your slogan, btw. It was good... just afraid to put my trust in hyper-capitalists like our lord and saviour The Donald. Gosh, I wish my dreams were that interesting! ... Besides sleep paralysis. My mother and brother get it and it really doesn't sound pleasant. And not to worry about demons- I used to feel and see them swirling around me in the dark, as a kid, when I was walking through the house at night.<br /><br />
Was reminded of how beautiful forests were on my expedition. It was in the New Forest, which has old (England why?), well-spaced trees and wild ponies living in the African-esque grasslands. Do you mean desert people are rotten or L.A. people? The desert folks I knew were quite rough-n-ready, but friendly all the same. The bugs tho. At least neither of us lives in Australia- both for the bugs, and the new gender-propaganda being forcefed to schoolchildren.<br /><br />
Absolutely. People have lost their faith in monarchs, but not their fear and awe of power. I heard someone say a good fascist state will eventually become a monarchy of sorts. What do you think? You're a bottomless pit of Trump puns- should have really joined his propaganda team!</p>
