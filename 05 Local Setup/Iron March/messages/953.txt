<p>Thank you very much for the welcome, and hello to you too. I will gladly answer your questions!</p>
<p>German blood? Not that I know of. I'm hoping I do, but from my grandparents, all I have heard is that my blood is all based from the North of the British Isles. So basically Scottish English, with a tiny bit of Irish. What about you?</p>
<p>To answer your second question: Yes. I am interested in Germany in the First World War, the 1800's, and as far back as the 1500's. German culture and folk traditions are also an interest of mine: Look at the beautiful regional clothes! Not to mention the food, damn it sounds delicious...</p>
<p>I am very willing to learn about all aspects of German history really, Europe is my passion with the Fatherland being the heart of it.</p>
<p>And, the NSDAP...The party has also influenced my morals. I love the ideas of strength, loyalty, pride...Etc. Politically it has pushed me to the Right side of the spectrum, yes. </p>
<p>The only thing I am not too keen on is the emphasis of keeping women in more traditional roles, and if they have to work, in more 'typically female' jobs. For example, nursery assistants and the like.</p>
<p>Thanks for your questions by the way. It did cheer me up a little to see a message in my inbox, haha.</p>
