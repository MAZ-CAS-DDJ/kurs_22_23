<p>Good on Occidental House bit, I have some links to share that you may like. Qho is Fasces again? Why a National Socialist slant? And I have a question, if you abandon "Union!" I'm seriously considering taking it for myself to replace Reaktion!</p>
<p>Tell me about your religious projects.</p>
<p>Regards to whatever it is your mother is going through.</p>
<p>I haven't officially converted to the Orthodoxy, I'm going to wait awhile before starting catechumem. I've taken a liking to the Romanian OC, although the only difference in the nationalities behind the churches are just that, nationalities. Same message, different flavor.</p>
<p>God bless Codreanu for inspiring me!</p>

<p>Do share them, by all means. Fasces is a member of the Politics Forum, and registered here awhile back; although only to gripe at us. He lives in DC and says he'd be willing to help. The NS slant may be the result of my constant see-sawing between Traditional Reactionary sympathies and Revolutionary Conservative sympathies. I've always had a penchant for National Socialism, although of a Strasserist variety, not Hitlerian. But perhaps not, and I'll just go with <strong>Union! </strong>under a different name. If I do abandon it, you may use it; although hopefully sticking to it's intended Traditionalist purpose. I'm also working my ass off to try and get a organisation established. Found a webhost, now I need to work out where I want it to go. There's never been a better time to get into politics, my friend.</p>
<p>My religious projects consist mainly of my blog and a devotional to the deified heroes and gods. My sacra privata is devoted almost entirely to the Deified Julius Caesar, so I'm trying to see if I can get him and other similar deities recognized within Nova Roma. It'll be difficult though as the Pontifical College seems to be dormant.</p>
<p>The Romanian OC seems one of the the most of the Autocephalous churches. I of course prefer the Patriarchate of Constantinople, Byzantine man that I am, but the Romanians would be  a close second. What are your thoughts on Oriental Orthodoxy?</p>
