First, the Islam thing. No, not a Muslim. My friend Joe (elegos on here) and I have been discussing the role of Islam in traditionalism, specifically in regards to Guenon and Schuon. We have also been reading the works of Ayatollah Khomeini and studying the Islamic Revolution. Basically, trying to understand how Islam has managed to stave off modernism in the Middle East and its role in a non-democratic State. I threw the avatar and signature on there for laughs. I've already gotten hate mail for it (aside from your benign inquiry) so I think it is working lol.</div></blockquote>
<p>Haha I see what you mean. The one caveat about Islam is that while it's kept off modernism, it's sunk rather into barbarism, although it had periods where it matched up to the glory days of the West. Who'd you get hate mail from?</p>
<p>Also, if you want to screw with those people more <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span> have a pretty cool avatar, <a href="http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/195/9/b/allah_by_hashem37927-d3lhwnz.jpg" rel="external nofollow">here.</a></p>

He said something along the lines of totalitarian socialism or national socialism is, by definition, monarchism. I have always been a socialist in a loose sense (not a Marxist or hard leftist by any means though) but through my study of Orthodoxy, have grown to appreciate and endorse monarchism,when appropriate. However, nations like America will never be monarchic in the true sense of the world, so I leaned on this envisioned socialist autocracy which serves as a stand in for an official monarchical system. All fairly hypothetical.</div></blockquote>
<p>Ah yes, I saw that quote by Spengler up at the top of the main page. I understand completely, and I think that fascists should try to learn from the old monarchies with regard to how powerful a force the monarch can be for the preservation of the nation and traditionalism.</p>
