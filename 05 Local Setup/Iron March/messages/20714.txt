	I'll get on it. Although, on the topic of not wanting to use the word "fag", why? I think Slavros put it pretty good, " <span style="color:rgb(224,224,224);font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(28,28,28);float:none;">The more inflammatory the better, you WANT to make the fags upset and the onlookers shocked but at the same time they have to deal with compartmentalizing the "bad no-no offensive word" with the horrible truth provided via the poster and that statistic."</span>
