<p>For instance something of an inspiration that just came onto me: a montage of various footages, BUF, Iron Guard, Spanish Falanga and etc, with their leaders set to the pace of <em><strong>The Saints Are Coming</strong></em> by <strong>Von Thronstahl.</strong> At the start the changes between footages could be matched to the drums and the same for the end and whenever the drums are the central sound, and mix into that some modern footages that could be interpreted as Fascist, like taking some yank skinhead march with footage of their boots only - can't tell who's wearing the boots so it works.</p>
<p>Just an example, though I am tempted to try that one out myself now.</p>
