<p>As promised last night, a more comprehensive reply to you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But first, facebook:</p>
<p>- I accepted your friend request, thank you;</p>
<p>- as you will see, it is purposely bland. It is such because under the proper use of fb with a business a/c, individual page and business are linked. I deeply regret having followed their rules;</p>
<p>- I have my "Likes" switched off but wonder if you see in your NewsFeed my "Like" of the Black Shirts fb page as I did that after accepting the friend request. Incidentally, I "Liked" the NBU page last week;</p>
<p>- the nature of my business - florist - is such that it demands gaining as high a profile as possible on the Internet -search engines &amp; social media - as well as strong local word-of-mouth and networking. This means my apparent convictions have to be as neutral as possible, all in an effort geared towards the small business. Positioning in the market is key;</p>
<p>- Medford, NJ, is a staunch Republican town with a pop. of 22k. There are a number of Tea Party people - stronger than Dems - and I do count several as both fb and real-life friends. However, just to the west of us lies the populous rich Jewish ghetto of Cherry Hill and, next to that and across the Delaware, Camden, NJ, and Philly, both heavy Dem and left-wing and a marked presence of "N"s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The above written, <strong><u>it is time for me to stand-up and be counted</u></strong> &amp; have the courage of my deeply harbored views. I might be gingerly on fb, for reasons stated above, but in other venues and forms, I must make a stance for fascism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I feel I have been a fascist based upon the strong moral &amp; religious ethic of my (now deceased) parents and the experience of my travels.  I have lived in 3rd world countries and find their chaos, corruption, moral turpitude disgusting and adherence to Christian religious beliefs to be entirely wanting. I moved to Germany (Aschaffenburg, Bayern) in 1987 'til early 1993 and that move threw any uncertainty I had on fascism away.  I meet fascists of all ages and found members of the Wehrmacht and SS fascinating. The matters of everyday life under National Socialism were revealing regardless of during peace or war.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My desire is to die under a Fascist state and the more that exist, the better. I suppose my time in Germany has me leaning more towards National Socialism than true Fascism, as you clearly do but I trust that will not be held against me.  I deeply admire Oswald Mosley and his BUF and what he attempted to do for the peoples of Britain. The Public Order Act and the banning of uniforms &amp; military political parties is surely when the BUF started to dwindle. His efforts to work for a negotiated peace until his arrest in 1940 are to be honored for he was working for his nation and fascism. On Mussolini, I pale in your shadow and any books or on-line links you can recommend to me, I would greatly appreciate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, what skill set(s) do I have to offer?  I am told I am a relatively strong public speaker but that is probably for further down the road. My athletic skill is in swimming with a daily plunge and, while not particularly physical <em>per</em> <em>se</em>, I have used skin before when necessary.  Possibly my strongest skill is my ever-growing fervor for the cause.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the USA, I know of no clear fellow fascist, bar you. Sadly, as I wrote above, this country-cum-dormitory town is steeped in Republicanism and that are relevant Jewish influences.  I am conscious of a couple of friends potentially willing to work for fascism and I will commence work on that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although I will retain a blah position on facebook under my name and the business name, I will start a WordPress blog under the name I use here, ProudFascist. I recognize that is probably going to be hard to find with all the blogging that goes on but I need to start it, with the focus being on becoming a declared Fascist and subsequently, joining the NBU.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the above reason(s), I need to know the main strategy and direction the US division of the NBU is to take - it can hardly be built around British nationalism, surely. Is the focus to be on moral &amp; Christian fortitude and moving smartly away from the government peddled liberalism and hedonistic behavior?  Or is the target capitalism and banking?  Or immigration and race?  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Have you any NBU papers -with or without an American slant - you can forward to me?  If so, note that my e-mail addresses are iredale1@verizon.net -this being the one the NBU has- and ProudFascist@mail.com - this being the one related to Word Press and for which I use to access Iron March. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing further from you and learning more about the cause in general and on my part in the NBU in the USA.</p>
