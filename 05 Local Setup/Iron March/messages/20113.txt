	The socialism in National Socialism is not the same socialism in the leftist sense, it's not marxist, if you think it is then that means you're a strasserist, and the strasserists were purged from the NSDAP for a reason. What socialism in National Socialism means is essentially "to each his own" meaning all members of the nation have a certain duty and a certain place they are meant to fullfill in the grand scheme of things. Easiest way to put that into perspective is to think of every nation as a living organism, just like your body which produces specific cells to achieve certain tasks that only they can achieve, so does a nation, but in the end they all work towards the same end goal, which is making the organism healthy. This itself is essentially the caste system, which is explained in Next Leap, the original way in which Aryan society was governed. The caste system is the application of the universal order to the society of a nation.<br /><br />
	The leftist idea of socialism is the perversion of what I previously spoke of, in their eyes it means "all are equal" but this is in the sense of the lowest common denominator, which is the lower class worker. The difference is of course in National Socialism all are equal insofar as they are all of the same race, the same volk, the same organism, yet every person is bound to a duty they were born to fullfill.<br /><br />
	ANTIFA means anti-fascism but in a sense they are anti-truth, because we fight for the Truth that governs the universe, they oppose us, and therefor oppose the Universal Truth.
