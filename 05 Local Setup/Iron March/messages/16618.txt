	Exactly.  I reckon National Action are a promising bunch. :P Their flash mob protests are a great idea.  The shock factor of it gets the message out effectively IMO.<br /><br />
	Sounds good. I know of another guy in Tasmania (near hobart where i am: has the username here Unity), and another one that lives up north. I made a discord account last night to join the ironmarch discord group.   A meet up like that sounds cool.    A heap of good forest hiking tracks down here. <br /><br />
	Great.  I look forward to seeing it.   Do you have religious requirements for the group,  ie strictly christian or strictly pagan? I'm torn on the topic of faith.
