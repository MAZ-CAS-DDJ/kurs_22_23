			Basically yes, plus there are a lot of priests and believers who can feel that there is something wrong with the leadership, only they don't really know what it is exactly. That's why Vatican II is deceitful, for it has some good elements but also a lot what can be interpreted in opposite ways. <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/7117-pope-francis-vs-cardinals/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=172266" rel="">Overman sees it as it is.</a>

			No. It works the same as Fascism, what is interpreted in different form everywhere since that's how different people can understand the same principle. And another no, you can't take everything literally in any holy books, it would go against their nature. When you take something literally you are abstracting, restricting and objectifying it - which works on limited objects, but would never work on the transcendent. Think about God - you can't. It is impossible even to imagine Him. That's why it would be a heresy to think that we, finite beings can grasp the Absolute, Infinite Totality we call God.

			This have to apply to people of different eras as well. Try to read a text from the middle age - maybe you can do that, but most of your people couldn't, that's why you have to be able to change, not the content but the form.

			Let me give you a metaphor. When you are looking at a tower from a moving car, you always have to turn your head a little in order to keep it in your view. If you move too much, you won't see it, but if you don't move at all, you won't see it either. Truth is always the same, but since the world itself is a constant motion, you have to balance it with counter-motions.

			As long as this wouldn't mean the rejection of our history it's okay. Some kind of Imperialism is needed, the thing you mentioned about the Russians would be something like that. Also, imagine Fascism without a powerful leader like Hitler. It would have been chaos, a war between Fascist states with the quick victory of the Allies. This way we made them bleed at least.

	Many have said that Russia will be the preserver of Europe, I believe even Hitler said that the future belongs to the strong men of the East.<br />

			So basically you only want lands which were BOTH historically yours and where Serbs are living today? What about Kosovo then? Sure it was historically Serbian, but you won't find a lot of Serbs there today. Also, you can only claim most of those lands by implying that Croats are somehow Serbs, but if that's true, than why don't you want to take Croatia as a whole? Nation states are a result of the French revolution, of Modernity, thus they are humanistic, lame and weak. It was the interest of others to turn Yugoslavia into those pathetic mini-states, cause it's easier to devour them like that.

	Serbs lived in Thessaloníki yet we don't claim it as ours. Kosovo was one of the oldest lands of Serbia, no wonder it is, together with Macedonia, called Old Serbia. Plus it is our literal holy land from which we have been in a way exterminated. It's not hard to imagine our soldiers on that land soon and our churches and monasteries free. Why would we want whole Croatia? We know our borders, the rest can be a province of Slovenia or Hungary for all we care.  Little nations are made for nation-states. Empire builders are not. There are no empire builders on the Balkans today and there never will be one.
