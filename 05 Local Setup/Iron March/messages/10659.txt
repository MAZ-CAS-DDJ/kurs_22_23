<p>Thanks, the point wasn't really about going out and converting people, but rather to be confident you can present your views in normal social situations (work, friends, familly, etc) and handle any bullshit that comes your way. Most people aren't surrounded by redpilled people, and feel bad that they have to repress their views continuously, so I wanted to address that problem.</p>
