	Damn. Lots of guys in the military become red pilled. Seeing first hand how little the government actually takes care of its fighting force, much less it's citizens is more than enough for many. And if that's not enough, killing some sand niggers does the rest. There's a catch 22 though. Some come out of it for some reason, utterly blue pilled. I'm with 3/23.Â
