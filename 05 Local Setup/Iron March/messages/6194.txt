<p>It's easier said than done, pretty much any bordering nation of ours has some land which we desire, I don't know about Ukraine, but at least that's the case with Romania(including some Ukrainian soil, heh.)</p>

<p>Although nowadays I'm more of a moderate nationalist in this regard - Moldova is Romania, Kosovo is Serbia and Macedonia is Bulgaria, but that's about it. The days of border fiddling are long gone and instead of fighting like idiots over lost territories we could strive for a better future in a stronger Balkans.</p>
