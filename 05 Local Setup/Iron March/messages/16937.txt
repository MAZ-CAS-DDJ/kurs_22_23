	Precisely. Games these days are really used as a form of Escapism such as Alcohol or Smoking. It should just be something that should be enjoyed from time to time and not to a huge extent. <br /><br />
	That's why I love games such as Thief, the lore and the worlds are so rich it really delves you into it. Karras is so unique in that hes the only villain who doesn't have this typical sinister or brutal voice. <br /><br />
	I know the person who voiced Garrett had a huge say in the level design, apparently he just used to go in the studio sometimes, change his script and the entire team had to fit the level around what he just said. <br /><br />
	They're amazing games, Planescape is my favorite game of all time due to its amazing story and plot, you honestly feel something for him and all the characters and feel that your on this quest too. <br /><br />
	You should also try out Neverwinter Nights 2. It's more recent but the length and plot of the game has its own Unique selling point too, plus the character design is immense.<br /><br />
	Cheers for the tip, and its good to see another Hammerite here.
