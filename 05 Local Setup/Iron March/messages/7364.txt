<p>he has good intentions/is open-minded and I think his character is often misjudged by people who haven't thought to approach him in a friendly way because of his at-times combative nature, and that is ultimately why I defend him. he doesn't always make it easy to defend him but I don't think he'd be that way if people approached conversations with him by working off agreements instead of disagreements, which is why I made a big deal of it. sometimes I get outspoken too but I really just want everyone to get along. perhaps I should have taken a different approach to defending him, since I don't really have anything against the people I was arguing with, even if I got a bit pissed.</p>
