	Yep, it's quite basic. There is better literature:<br />
	Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Nietzsche is good though he's too materialistic for my liking.<br />
	Revolt Against the Modern World by Evola however is fantastic (if you can get it in hardback, don't know about you but I can't read .pdfs)<br />
	And Sun and Steel by Mishima.
