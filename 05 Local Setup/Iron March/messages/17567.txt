	Hey!
</p>

<p>
	I hope you all right, I haven't heard about you in a while.

	The leadership on IronMarch just decided to leave Skype as it is unreliable so Discord is the general chat what we have now. It's more simple, you don't even need to download it as it can be run from your browser. In order to join, first you should register in discord (use the same username what you are using here), then join the channel (link in the IM thread) and ask for entry. Then Slavros will ask you to prove that you are really from IronMarch so you will have to post something he asks you to in <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/7106-the-official-official-im-discord/" rel="">this thread</a>.

	Come on, it's all day shitposting and we could finally talk about how to finish those designs I made for you!
