<p>Hello, unfortunately I have been rather slack on my reading. So no, I have not. It is rather down the list, although I am obviously a massive fan of Dr Goebbels. So I will get to it eventually, hopefully in a few months. Have you read it, or have you read Goebbels :Mastermind of the Third Reich?</p>
