	Soldiers from our regions don't fight like, for example, Americans do. Those are the real robots and slaves.

			Most of the Hungarians would say the same about Romania (remember the "best of betrayal" list I sent you), or any of the post-Trianon states for that matter. I know that's not exactly the same situation, but there are a lot of similarities. Anyway, those times have passed, get over it. It's on us to build a better future, but in order to do that first we have to stop supporting our real enemies with all of these pity skirmishes between us. You as a Serb know better than anyone else that the Jew stands ready to exploit every one of these conflicts. Look at Ukraine; Russia wasn't able to defend even them. I hope she gets back her power, but meanwhile time passes and we are fading away, paralyzed by our obsessions with wars already fought by our ancestors. Don't be sad, we will have an even bigger one against the greatest enemy ever - but only if we can get there.

	I doubt that Romanians in a span of little more than 50 years managed to erase over half a million of your people, assimilate you under the barrel of a gun and put your kids in concentration camps. Ffs, they have butchered people and threw their corpses into the Danube so people in Serbia could see. True, Croatia is not the main enemy, but when the conditions are right we are rolling over there to settle the scores. The only ones who do things like these are fucking Jews.
