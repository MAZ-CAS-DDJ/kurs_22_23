<p>I am uncertain if you received my earlier message because an error occurred when I sent my previous message. My real name is Stephen. I joined this forum a long time ago, but I haven't been an active member of the Iron March online community for quite some time. I have returned and I want to join the Atomwaffen Division. I currently reside in Texas. I recently learned that you are serving in the military. If you are too busy to talk to me, is there someone else I can contact?</p>
