	really what do you like about them ? 
</p>

<p>
	I think Necrons are cool , well there's cool things about all the factions really, except the Tau literally space communists.

	I like how its explained with the Old Ones creating life throughout the galaxy sort of like in Halo and other series that play on the ancient aliens hypothesis.

	Some writers attempted to do the same with Star Wars and the celestials but it never took off , which I thought it should have because it gave a good explanation for why the species are all humanoid because their evolution was guided by a single ancient race. That also may or may not have created the force similar to the warp.
