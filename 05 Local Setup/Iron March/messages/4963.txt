<div>It's a php script so it doesn't matter which forum software/CMS you use, although you can edit them through some control panel it's easier to just edit the raw file yourself. All php should install within a directory that is reached by the command line, your browser or whatever you use to navigate. I obviously don't know which directory you specifically keep your php scripts in, but I can tell you that the file itself should be named either settings.php or mysettings.php, if not those than something similar. </div>
