<p>I have, however, Europe (therefore the concept European) is much more than a continent to me. It is an ideal, a most noble one, and everyone of European blood is connected to it no matter where you are in the world. I see no problem with establishing autonomous European States within the United States and furthermore I reject their nationalism because they support "Anglo-Saxondom" which would be a diluted form of Civic Nationalism where all races are just expected to unite for "Amurrika!". It would encourage Anglo supremacy not only over colored race (which is stupid, I support their right to self determination just as much as I do Europeans) but also over European non-Anglos (which includes me).</p>
<p>Their authoritarian push to try to pick up the remnants of a decaying capitalist behemoth and force all these groups into a "Greater Federal America" will end horribly if it is ever realized at all.</p>
<p>I also see it as my duty living in America to combat the beast from within. I know you may have different feelings being a Canadian, but Americanism and Anglo-Saxondom is a disease upon the world and it would just better if it was shut down and left in the annals of history.</p>
