	Bullying/hazing is an integral part of the welcome process. Your intro materials were posted on page 6 of your intro, they should have been posted earlier, but you should have read them before joining, even. And you said you did, anyways. When you said you were from AV of course it was going to come to this, you people can't admit you're wrong and think you know everything. Read the materials, then come back and argue with us and tell us why we are wrong. Not &gt;u didnt read history, the people on IM are some of the most well people about fascism and it's exactly that reason that they have come to the conclusion that fascism/NS are inherently the same. If you're going to refuse to read what they have written and cup your hands over your ears, then of course you are going to get a warning. No one else did because they are trying to help you but you won't engage them, once again, typical AV/VA symptom, we've had enough of your members here to know and strangely enough they all end up getting gassed or storming off angry
