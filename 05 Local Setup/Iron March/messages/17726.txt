	I don't believe the American people will submit to a government they deem illegitimate. It's too ingrained in our culture, that sense of individualism, and that deep hatred of what our people might deem a "tyrannical" government. So in the case of the United States, yes, I personally believe that fascism must come about in a mostly democratic process. This does not mean I believe that every country is the same, but the United States has been democratic since it's inception, and I don't believe at all that people will simply "step in line" if a fascist government seized power.

	So when I talk about keeping parts of the system, that's what I mean. That doesn't mean I'm compromising any of my personal beliefs about the failures of democracy or the degeneracy of liberalism, it just means I'm being pragmatic.
