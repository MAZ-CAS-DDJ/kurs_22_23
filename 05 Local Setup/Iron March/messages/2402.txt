<p>I suppose one cannot be too opposed to them. They merely do exactly what the anti nationalist media wants them to do. They continue to hinder nationalism. </p>
<p>Much of the time, the US has held Israel behind. The US forced Israel to give the Sinai back. Land that would have been for expansion and GDP growth. Depending what Israeli you ask, a future with an America that is not involved is good for Israel because it will allow the nation to be independent and autonomous. </p>
<p>I think many people are paranoid. Anti socials on the Internet especially (ultimately sites as this). But I agree many Jews think non Jews just want to kill them. Which often they do. And the stance of neonazis do not help this perception. </p>
<p>Anyway, I am considering I am done with this site. There is nothing really to be learned from the Internet site. When I return to Germany, I will return to involvement with the National Socialists I knew. Debating with Americans about politics is ultimately pointless. They will never acknowledge that National Socialism has been a progression. Similar to how religions pick from what they like and what is logical from illogical texts.</p>
