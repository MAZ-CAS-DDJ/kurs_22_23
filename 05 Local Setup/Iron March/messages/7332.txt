<p>It's fine to talk to me whenever, you strike me as a good person, and I appreciate that. I don't visit /new/ either, but a lot of the "in-crowd" on the forum does.</p>

<p>From what I gathered, a lot of the people in that thread were Iron March posters. In any case, people like Ben should be ashamed to consider things like imageboards a big deal. That's the real embarrassment here.</p>

<p>I'll keep posting for now (though last time this happened I threatened to leave if slavros banned vlad, which ben circumvented by doing the banning himself), if anything because I don't feel comfortable not voicing my opinion on this. I don't know if I have the time to sustain a continual argument right now, but I'm considering making my own thread on the same subject, because if anything, it will be harder for the people who derailed that thread because it was vlad to do the same thing to me.</p>
