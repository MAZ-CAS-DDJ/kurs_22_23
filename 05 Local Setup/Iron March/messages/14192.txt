	Hey man, I'm in Western Canada and I want to start recruiting for our local movement. I have an issue that I'd like your advice on, if you've got the time and inclination
</p>

<p>
	I live in a relatively small town. Reputation is a pretty big deal here, and my father is in a very leftist/PC line of work (he's mostly on board with fascism though) The problem here is that if word gets around that his son is spreading ebil nazi racist ideology, he could very likely get canned. My family has a hard enough time supporting themselves as it is.
</p>

<p>
	I can put up flyers and such, but seeing as I'm currently the only person in my area that I or anyone else knows of, I'd have to get to real life networking with any potential recruits eventually, or it wouldn't go anywhere.
</p>

<p>
	My other two options that I can see are either distancing myself from my family, making it clear that I don't associate with them (which isn't even sure to work because of the nature of my dads job) or just moving to another town entirely. I'm likely to do that regardless, but I'd like to start here and now.
</p>

<p>
	I'd like to know what your thoughts are. Thanks.
