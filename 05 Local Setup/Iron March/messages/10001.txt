<p>As the "communist" China abandons marxism the west adopts it. Makes you wonder who won the Cold War after all. The saddest thing is that these entitled shits can vote. So that is why you had your Obama and his welfare spending what objectively we can call "buying the votes".</p>

<p>I miss being younger. I remember when I only know the US from 80s actions movies and documentaries about Vietnam and the Gulf War. I had a much positive opinion about the country back then.</p>

<p>Liberalism is reduction. If we look at it it's now based on post modernism which deconstructs and questions everything as subjective. This is why we have sciences assaulted by feminist and antiracist agendas. Liberals/cultural marxist hate meritocracy and facts. For example science is black and white you are either wrong or right. That is why they flock to the "humanities" where you can bullshit your way trough. The problem is that those people worth way less economically than a plummer. What they can do? Whine on tumblr, work in academia and be politicians. Personally I gave up caring about them they are not worth my time I have no influence over them after all.</p>

<p>Math can be learned, I don't believe in talent just hard work.</p>

<p>Sure thing. The current system will simply implode based on demographics and economics. When the parasites outweigh the producers it simply collapses. No amount of printing money or "taxing the rich" or affirmative action will help them when they run out of wealth to transfer. The problem is that the dumbest people are dumb and live like animals so they will breed kids they can't afford, buy houses they can't afford and degrees they don't need and expect society to bail them out because they "deserve it". They are legion so they are the ones people pander to politically. Look at Sweden how they already have muzzies in their government etc. The saddest part of this is that society simply keeps telling these feel good lies because nobody dares to offend everybody, even at the price of their lives.</p>
