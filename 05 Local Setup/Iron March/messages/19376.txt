	East Texas here. I've heard nothing about Michael Hill becoming Orthodox, and have little interest in the aging and non-ideological membership of the SCV. There are several League members who did convert, most prominently William Flowers who led the Georgia branch before joining Heimbach's TWP. If anything Anglicanism seems to be the rising religion in Southern Nationalism, with proponents like Michael Cushman and R.G. Miller.
