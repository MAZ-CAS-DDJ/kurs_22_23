<p>My views on economics are more like that of the Strasser bros then that of the Third Reich, though I feel that compromising with the bourgeois was the right thing to do. However NS Germany was state socialist as war-socialism was implemented during the war. Its a shame that Gregor was killed. I think killing him as well as many people that were slaughtered in The Night of the Long Knives were a mistake. Hitler even felt terrible after The Night of the Long Knives. On the other hand many of the people needed to go and it was playing it safe.</p>
<p>Italian Fascism only became more antisemetic post-1936. Racism became a part of Italian Fascism due to imperialism. Race is important and a white supremacist imperialist foreign policy should be implemented against Africa and the Middle East. I do dislike antisemitism against Italian Jews. I am only very antisemetic against American and to a lesser degree European Ashkenazi Jews.</p>
