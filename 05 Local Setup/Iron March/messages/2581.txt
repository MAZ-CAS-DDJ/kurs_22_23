<p>Well, a lot of needed qualities are largely forgotten these days. This is the great failure of our modern world. It just shames me that even in a community of various nationalities, ethnic ranges, etc. united all by our common disagreement &amp; opposition to the modern world, our great divider are the jews. You'd think it'd be something else. I'm certainly not perfect in any regard, but I know my faith, and I know my culture.</p>
<p>You are Ukrainian, correct? I am a German. Although our two cultures may not have too much TOTALLY in relation with each other, both your people &amp; mine have suffered the weight of something like Soviet oppression(I was born in the '80's, right in Eastern Germany(Stettin). The last few years before the wall fell were the worst.) Although, my people ravaged Soviet lands regardless of which 'Soviet republic' it was, during our invasion. </p>
<p>My signature just means a lot to me. Adolf Hitler saw a man's mother as his hearts' lock-and-key, and I'm inclined to agree. I could hate all &amp; turn against everything - even my own, but I could not turn against my mother. Like him, I know a day is coming when I will escort her through her last days, and she will ask nothing more of me. That will be a bitter hour for me, as it should be for any self-respecting male. </p>
<p>I'm sure as fuck not normally sentimental, but my mother is something far more special to me than really anything on this Earth. Adolf Hitler felt the same about his mother.</p>
