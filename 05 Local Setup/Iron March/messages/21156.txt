	Yeah, training camps and facilities would be something that would be really interesting to see, we have some possibilities for private training here in my country but it's all commercial provided by army veterans so not exactly cheap (about €100-€400 per training which takes one or two days). Kiev and Ukraine in general is pretty cheap by my standards so I'm hoping to stay for a couple of days.

	I go to concerts a lot, it's how I got into NSBM and fascism as such. When it comes to photos, for me it's not so much about covering everything but more about getting materials for visual propaganda, for example this was made using a photo I took at a Der Stürmer concert (it's when I saw Goatmoon too).
