<p>Self-proclaimed fascist, gave Roman salutes after important victories, the most passionate football player of our generation and probably the last passionate professional football player playing on that level ever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He's the embodiment of fascist ideal of daring lifestyle, courage and honour. I always looked up to him as a footballer, he was passionate and crazy but he always had honour and an ideal of fair play and sportmanship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This move symbolizes his character:</p>

<p>I was the same when I played football and in general my character is similar. I'm extremely passionate and temperamental, also unpredictable to some extent, but I always have fascism and an ideal of honour in my heart.</p>

<p>Do you know what the slav word for bear is? In proto-Slavic it was <em>medved</em>, it's still the same in modern Slovenian and Croatian, it means honey-eater.</p>
