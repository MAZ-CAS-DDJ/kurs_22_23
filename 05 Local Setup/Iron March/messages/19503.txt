			What was the opinion back then about the First Vienna Award? Hungarian politics were led mostly by the thirst for revenge for Trianon, but since ethnically the 1938 borders were more just I would think the Slovaks could accept the loss of territory more easily. Also I haven't seen any Revisionist Slovak propaganda from that period, only those nice borders I like so much. :D

	Well, people were pissed off. Slovakia didn't lose even south but parts of Spiš and Orava too(Mainly Slovak population, Stalin gave it to Poland after war as "reparations"(with some other areas) for areas that Soviet union took from Poland). For example in Košice lived mainly Slovak population (Hungarians were big minority(arround 20-30% as far as i remember) bit Slovaks were still mayority). Or Šaňo Machs birth village Slovenský meder was taken too by Horthy. The problem was that your people havent taken only Hungarian mayority areas. We were sure that we would lose the war, so we havent been provocating with revisionist propaganda(most logical answer i figured out, our politicians wanted bigger borders of course).

	I'm was thinking the same thing since i joined, but i haven't got enough time to do it with all needed information. Writing that on tablet would be impossibe for me and family members don't let me be on computer too long because they want do stuff on it too. I will try to write in some txt file piece by piece and then just paste it here and add images. Where should i put it in? In famous persons or in ex-czechoslovakia?
