<p>Highly interesting!  Would you mind throwing me some sources for these claims?  I know nothing of the history of Dacia.</p>
<p>I have a purely hypothetical question for you:  What would a Dacain state look like?  Where would its borders lie, and (most important for a philologist such as myself) what language would it speak?  The Romanian language is an obvious reminder of Roman infiltration into the Dacian nation, but Dacian is a language lost to history with only distant (if any) relatives surviving into the present.</p>
<p>Also, what sort of links do you perceive to exist between Dacians and the Teutons?  You imagery and rhetoric strike me as exceptionally Germanic.</p>
