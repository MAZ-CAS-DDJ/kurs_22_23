<p>Whoopsie missed this. "The conference in St. Petersburg under threat of bombing - the conference was cancelled." </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As such, I don't know (nor do they apparently) if they will resume the conference and if there will even be a detailed report. It says that the representatives from NRM are back at the hotel. </p>
