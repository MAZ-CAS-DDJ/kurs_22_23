	Interesting! I would gladly exchange experience with you. I'm active within Falanga organisation and I'm also one of the editors of Xportal.pl, where we are promoting Traditionalist worldview, knowledge about geopolitics and international relations and many more (sometimes we do intellectual provocations, because we like causing butthurt, both among pathetic lefties-liberals and neocons).<br />
	If you want to know about what's going on in Motherland, ask me anything.<br />
	I know, that Polish diaspora in the US is very patriotic, despite being across the ocean. Are there many Poles with worldview similiar to yours?
