	With shipping including or thats just the shipping ? Cuz if the whole thing is 90 +USD i will probably delay the order. I have some mates having seasonal jobs in the USA and might do it through them. Would it technically be a problem if such book is carried over an airport a long with, well The Turner Diaries for example ?
