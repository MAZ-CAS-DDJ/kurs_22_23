<p>I refer to the "occident" as the Julius Evola's definition, like a contamination or a hemorrhage of the european blood, that use this same european blood to spread itself around the world, it was the history of the american colonisation and the tragedy for american natives, and this occidentalism turns against us when all the world can also come at our homeland.</p>
<p>now there is more often zionist or liberals who refer as an occidental identity, beyond borders, than european nationalists.</p>
<p>I think that when vikings came in Vinland, they always refered to their homeland or blood as identity.</p>
<p>I would prefer a identity based on the blood line, than the idea of actual mondialisation.</p>
<p>For the wider racial net, i'm not so sure, there was some jews, arabs, korean and turkmens in the reich army, and even magyar, finnish, caucasian, turkic people, or half-chinese in the SS. I think that none serious would only focus in "aryan". But none serious would also consider jews like other "white", there are something ... different.</p>

<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="202" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Are you familiar with Distributism? It sounds similar to this system.</div></blockquote>
<p>I only discovered it a few days ago. It's not an idea from the francophonic culture.</p>
<p>I prefer socialism, not a state-socialism like in USSR but a national-collectivisation of means of production at the local level, in the factory or the quarter, the city or the local industry. It's more closer to the anarchistic vision of economy, and it's real that it's closer too with distributism.</p>
<p>Means of production wouldn't be between state or individual hands but for the community, it goes with an economy (production and consumption) focus on the local level, you would eat what the agriculture around you produced, and not what is imported from brazil, gabon or australia when the agriculture around you that produce the same thing is exportated anywhere.</p>
<p>Distributism seem to always be preferable than state-socialism or capitalism i agree, but there is no real interest outside a free market systeme (when decision of price and partners are decided by the community), or with a free market, it would quickly become again a capitalism way.</p>
<p>I don't believe in guilds too, because it would be the employer that decided all, and it will have a bad influence in the society between syndicats or old corporations. In a systeme where workers are free, why they would organise in group of interests ? To bicker themselves ?</p>
<p>The third Reich created the Labor Front, a single organic body for all workers, i think it is better. A middle between the old syndical way, the soviet way, and the fascist corporatist way.</p>
<p>But, and this is why I'm Fascist, I think these economic issues (who possess means of productions?) are secondary, the important thing is to have :</p>
<p>- A mimimum redistribution of wealth, from the 1% for example, in my country, they earn 20 times more than average income, and half from the interests, not their own work.</p>
<p>- An education to know better manage its business (it was the weakness of the Soviet, they did not know how to do)</p>
<p>- Nationalisation of banks and trusts</p>
<p>- Protectionism and sovereignty of the nation's economy, with companies such relocations, and fund locally.</p>
<p>- The end of speculation, the credits and  borrowing unprofitable for the society, and high rates of interests, thus ending the high finance.</p>

<p>It's really a big piece,</p>

<p>difficult to summarize</p>
<p>Aryan (Indo European) religion was the primitive religion of the Aryans, who has declined over time in different forms by adapting to local cultures, religions as Germanic, Celtic, Roman, Slavic, Greek, Persian, Armenian, Indian, etc.</p>
<p>If you already know a little Germanic religion, or the greco-roman beliefs, it will be very simple, you already know the Aryan religion, they are all from the common core, there is the only mythology that really changes.</p>
<p>The main particularity of this religion is that there is a triple system (the tripartition): the wise (like the Druids or the Brahmins), warriors (as hoplites, Roman legionnaires or berserk) and craftsmen, producers, farmers. The Aryan 3 colors: respectively white, red and black.</p>
<p>(and traders are considered without caste, )</p>
<p>We worship  the sun, the moral war, blood, the family, the nature, and all these things.</p>
<p>Our symbol is the solar wheel, similar to the celtic cross, the svastika is a square version like there is versions with 3 (triskell), 4 (classic), 6, 8 (kolovrat) or 12 (dark sun) branches</p>
<p>Personally, i worship the Nature (whitout idealise it, but like it is), the sun, the sky, the life, the power and the blood.</p>
<p>I rarely get to do rituals in groups (perhaps one or two time each year), so it stay more an individual practice, i only occasionelly make an offering in woods, less often than christians goes to church. I won't say that the practice is "free" but it's very simple :</p>
<p>I always wear a mjollnir around my neck, but now this has become a fashion with metalheads. I will try to have one in wood to make the difference.</p>
<p>I believe in all values and first the sense of honor.</p>
<p>We don't came, we born pagan</p>
<p>We don't believe (in the monotheist conception) in anything, we feel all</p>
<p>We don't converts, we wakes</p>
<p>It's always uncounsciensly in us whit our blood, (the mythology said that europeans are all odin's sons) that's why Ernst Jung theorize the aryan psychanalyze differently from freud with his jewish psychanalysethat is better only for jews.</p>
<p>I refered to the aryan religion and common core because it allow me to claim as well germanic or celtic roots.</p>

Did you learn Breton in your family or did you have to go out and learn it? Are Breton, French, and English the only languages you are familiar with?</div></blockquote>
<p>I learned with my father who learned with is grand mother, it's difficult to learned outdoor today, but i feel a grat interest and perhaps it will reborn again. Only 5% of brittons are fluent with this.</p>
<p>I also learned spanish (i can't really speak, but i can easily read texts), and chinese (i think that studying a non-indo-european language is helpfull for an understanding of the linguistic system, to see it hindsight).</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="202" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>That is interesting. Would you be willing to accept autonomy as a compromise or are you dead-set on a resurrection of the Breton state within the framework of a Federal Europe?</div></blockquote>
<p>If the "enemy" (Paris government) is ready to let us autonomy, why only autonomy ? we would claim the independance. Local elections prove that if we ask for autonomy or independance, we have the same score. "half-nationalism" only exist as a compromise from colonisators, not for colonized people.  In the history, there is no declaration of autonomy but declaration of independance.</p>
<p>But now it won't be possible, not with the actual mondialisation, we see that Irland for example was a prey for the international finance, and to have a little state like cuba or north korea is not really suitable too, that's why i prefer the european level as a practice for a national-socialism way.</p>
