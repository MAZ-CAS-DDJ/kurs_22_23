<p>Could you give me examples of the Greek names you were talking about? It does not seem likely to me since the Aromanian legionanaires acted towards the Greeks the same way the Daco-Romanian ones did towards the Jews. And I don't buy the Greek side of the argument, m8. Aromanians and Arvanites in Greece are Greeks in all but name only, maybe only remembering a broken language learned at home and nothing else. And no, they call themselves armâni(just as the 'Vlachs' from Timok call themselves rumâni), vlach is an exonym for Eastern Romanic peoples. But lets not get into a debate about the identity of Aromanians and other Eastern Romanic peoples since I do want this conversation to remain civil.</p>
