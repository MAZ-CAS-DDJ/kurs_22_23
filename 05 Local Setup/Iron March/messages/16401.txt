			# Notes on preliminary retro siege cut video
		</p>

		<p>
			intro graphic: zooming in text looks a bit wonky. maybe it just fading in or some other animation would be better.
		</p>

		<p>
			0:19 there shouldn't be a rough cut like this. the music should continue. also, that noise can probably be mostly erased with a proper noise reduction algorhythm. if you send me the mp3 audio track, i can do it if you can't.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, i would cut the initial meeting, since they repeat the same things later.
		</p>

		<p>
			the begining should be a montage of juicy quotes from the rest of the show to whet people's appetite, with cool background music. then it would cut to the host giving his high-energy intro speech.
		</p>

		<p>
			2:40 that warning is gold, it should be put at the begining of the video, lol (just the audio)
		</p>

		<p>
			3:15 this is great. more of this for the whole video. i would just flash "danger" for a second though, and then keep the red tint, so that we can see his face. keep the music going for longer, though lower the volume. having people talk on a beat is great. 
		</p>

		<p>
			6:10 good candidate for the intro here "you want to bring about a violent revolution / it's going to happen on it's own. that's the meaning of helter skelter"
		</p>

		<p>
			6:20 again, let the music continue longer. though I'm not sure about this choice, it seems a bit too upbeat. the previous bit (with "danger") was perfect. it was dark and menacing, very retrowave. this music is a bit more standard techno, and doesn't fit the atmosphere. also, in general, you don't want to have such sudden "fade outs." the audio fade-outs should be much longer, or else it seems weird
		</p>

		<p>
			8:20 another quote for intro: "he killed 6 million / if he had, we wouldn't be stuck with them here today"
		</p>

		<p>
			9:00 quote: "bullet through head of reagan would have broken boredom? / not necessarily through his head" - freeze frame on his smile, lol
		</p>

		<p>
			10:25 quote: "you're advocating murder and terrorism, the violent overthrow of the government!"
		</p>

		<p>
			14:50 don't know what this quote is good for, but it's funny to me "himmler looked like a chiken farme / he WAS a chicken farmer - on the side"
		</p>

		<p>
			15:40 quote "what happened to nations that opposed the jews? rome, greece? / they died in racial degeneration"
		</p>

		<p>
			15:56 funny quote "sir, you are cursed / i don't FEEL cursed..."
		</p>

		<p>
			16:45 "hitler died in a bunker / and how did jesus wind up?"
		</p>

		<p>
			19:12 good footage of the boys who are riding with mason. look like some bad ass motherfuckers!
		</p>

		<p>
			19:35 "you wouldn't want your daughter marrying one of them / better one of them than a black"
		</p>

		<p>
			20:20 "anyone who consorts with blacks should be hung"
		</p>

		<p>
			22:25 "my grandfather died in madrid in 1939 / then he was fighting on the side of the communists"
		</p>

		<p>
			23:10 "as long as law and order are in hands of enemy, it's the enemy of us all"
		</p>

		<p>
			28:00 "satan is about stealing, killing, lying / then i guess satan is controlling this nation"
		</p>

		<p>
			33:40 "are you telling me hitler was like a christ? / probably greater"
		</p>

		<p>
			34:39 good intervention, but would be funny if you went full slo-mo with music, like "mind blown"
		</p>

		<p>
			35:05 this can be put right next to the quote above "hitler was greater than jesus christ / in every respect"
		</p>

		<p>
			36:00 "i would shoot anybody if it would make a difference"
		</p>

		<p>
			36:44 "if i'd have flipped ..."
		</p>

		<p>
			37:40 "concentration camp? / so you could go and concentrate"
		</p>

		<p>
			39:00 "would there be gas ovens in the camps? / sounds traditional"
		</p>

		<p>
			40:20 "you take care of symptoms, we take care of the cause"
		</p>

		<p>
			41:20 "it's been tried. let's give hate a chance"
		</p>

		<p>
			47:22 "where did you get this garbage / where did you get your philosophy, bob"
		</p>

		<p>
			48:10 "does cracking bother you? / no, i've had a few cracks taken at me. didn't take it personally"
		</p>

		<p>
			50:25 "am I mickey mouse? / i dunno. you might be"
		</p>

		<p>
			54:55 bob sermon / "and all that, plus 50 cent, will buy you a cup of coffee"
		</p>

		<p>
			59:15 "loving your enemies is suicide"
		</p>

		<p>
			64:55 "without hate, love is meaningless, like without night, day is meaningless"
		</p>

		<p>
			66:08 rockwell quote about fun
		</p>

		<p>
			69:10 "if i commited sins, it's sins of ommission. maybe I haven't fought hard enough, sacrificed enough"
		</p>

	<em><strong>"overall, would be more motivating to do a few shorter pieces on different subjects. obvious divisions would be "armed revolution" "jews" and "race", maybe one on spiritual matters, and morality. maybe one on manson, though that aspect could also be cut, since it's a bit obscure and off topic"</strong></em>
