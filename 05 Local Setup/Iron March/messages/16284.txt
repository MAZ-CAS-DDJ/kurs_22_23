	Thanks for your message, it's always a pleasure to spread the Fanatical Fascist Friendship! :D

	I am already working on a design, but I need some text to make it better. I had an idea for a more philosophical picture, but I just realized that I can use that with this design too. Wikipedia says that the official language in Algeria is Arabic, but you use French and Tamazight also, so what do you think about a poster what would present all three of these languages?

<p>
	The line would be something like that:
</p>

<p>
	<strong><em>The National Revolution must take place within your: </em></strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align:right;">
	&gt; روح (spirit)
</p>

<p style="text-align:right;">
	&gt; âme (soul)
</p>

<p style="text-align:right;">
	&gt; ⵜⴰⵣⵣⵉⵜ (body)
</p>

<p>
	Referring to the fact that your religion (spirit) is Islam, your culture/history (soul) is connected with Europe and your blood (body) is Berber. What is your opinion about it?
</p>

<p>
	Here is the unfinished version of my first design:
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="MJxzaFm.png" class="ipsImage" src="http://i.imgur.com/MJxzaFm.png" /></p>

	I have also versions with Swastika and the symbol of CNPA, but as you can see some corrections are needed.
