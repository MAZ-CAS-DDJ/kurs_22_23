<p>I see you are no longer active, but I noticed you are Jewish.</p>
<p>I was a Jew at one point, when I had my Bar Mitzvah. It is unfortunate you no longer post here. </p>
<p>The fact that Jews have become such a small population (where there were once 30 million or so in 1900), means I must value other Jews of different nationalities or race.</p>
<p>Solidarity to you. May you return.</p>
<p>Am ratzah ha'shem.</p>
