<p>As far as homosexuality goes: I don't personally believe in it religiously or morally. That being said, my sister is bi-sexual, and iv'e known and been some-what accepting of a few homosexuals before. I'm not 'okay' with it, and won't pretend to be, but depending on the person, as long as the topic isn't brought up, i feel i'm mature enough to leave it be and look past it.</p>

<p>As far as abortion goes: I don't feel it's right to abort a child because the mother doesn't want it. That child could adopted or raised by the state itself, perhaps to be a soldier or something. But i do feel that if the child will be born deformed, with a serious genetic illness, mentally retarded, etc. the state should decide to abort the child.</p>

<p>Also reminds me: What religion do you follow, if any?</p>
