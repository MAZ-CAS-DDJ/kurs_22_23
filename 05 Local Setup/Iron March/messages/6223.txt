<p>Yeah, I'm sure you've heard recently some of the tinfoil stories about Tor when Freedom Hosting got shut down, wellv they don't know what they're talking about, DPR and Freedom Hosting themselves fucked up, not TOR. TOR security stands up to scratch. Bruce Schneier is one of the worlds acknowledged experts in crypto. The NSA has managed to get some some exploits in on users machines. NATIONAL SECURITY. Very little to worry about unless you're an Israeli spy or the next Bin Laden. LEA DO NOT have the technology to de-anonymize TOR. If you can follow crypto here is what they have actually done. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/10/how_the_nsa_att.html" rel="external nofollow">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/10/how_the_nsa_att.html</a></p>

<p>The only problem with Freenet is it's pretty slow but it's highly secure, especially amongst people you know and are connecting to, rather than strangers which is obviously less secure. There are a few pro-white pages on Freenet and a few Leadless resistance ones but they haven't been updated since late 2011 and I doubt anything really takes place on them as they don't on the regular web. Freenet is used more by paedos than anything else because of how slow it is and because of its security. Freenet is peer to peer based.</p>

<p>Here's a guide on getting set up to communicate on Freenet. There are other more indepth guides which can be found on Freenet itself when you browse the Wikis set up on there.</p>

<p>There are other freenet set up guides but that one's sufficient enough for the stuff we'd be doing.</p>

<p>i2p is good for torrents.</p>

<p>Tor can obviously be used with proxy chains as well and a SOCKS proxy put on the end; this is how people post on 4chan with tor to get around bans and get away with posting CP.</p>

<p>As for True Crypt there are tons of guides out there on the internet which discuss hidden volumes but I think our faggy racist libertarian paedo "friend" explains it pretty well here, this is exactly how I did it and it works well.</p>

<p>Without a doubt one of the biggest money makers is credit card fraud, a field I'm pretty well learned in and experienced, I discovered myself a quicker way of getting by PIN protection rather than cracking the EMV or frying the chip was to coat over it with nail polish remover - of course you won't be able to draw from ATM but you'll be able to use it instore.</p>

<p>Here's a guide I wrote up for a website I used to post on 2 years ago. It's still applicable because I've tried to make the info as timeless as possible.</p>
