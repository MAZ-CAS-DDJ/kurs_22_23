	Hi there. I remembered reading <a href="http://golden-dawn-international-newsroom.blogspot.hu/2013/08/democratic-terrorism.html" rel="external nofollow">this article</a> and was wondering what is the state of Hellenic Paganism and (Fascist) mysticism/occultism/esotericism in general within Golden Dawn. IIRC you are not the greatest supporter of the movement, but I don't know anyone else whom I could ask about these things. Were you a member btw? If yes, what changed?

	I am interested mainly in these parts of the article:

			Yesterday was the night of the <strong>Blue Moon of August</strong>, one of the most beautiful natural events of summer and <strong>an important religious event</strong> for the pagan friends of Golden Dawn. The regional organization of <strong>Evia-Viotia</strong>, the architects of the Volksland Project and devoted ecologists decided to organize an educational trip to the <strong>Delphic Oracle</strong>, as part of our "Themes of Greek History" educational program.
		</p>

		<p>
			The comrades discussed about Pythia and her prophecies, the Delphic Maxims, and the Ethics of Plutarch.
		</p>

		<p>
			In a mystic atmosphere, with the landscape and the ancient ruins shining under the blue moonlight, <strong>we all became pilgrims in one of the most sacred places of Hellenism</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>The MSM later rambled that we were there to perform a "satanic ritual"!</strong> <em>(Was this an actual Pagan ritual or it's just the Lügenpresse?)</em> Comrade Ilias Kasidiaris had the right answer for them. Our comrades were there for educational and recreational purposes. Golden Dawn is a Christian party, and it will ban religions that offend Hellenism, like Judaism. <strong>Within its ranks it has followers of the Ancient Hellenic Religion</strong>, and accepts people of other religions, as long as they are not enemies of the Nation and the People.
