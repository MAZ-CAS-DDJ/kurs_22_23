<p>I studied the digital aspects of American national security while in college. Basically, the NSA and Secret Service have massive supercomputers devoted exclusively to searching for "imminent threats," usually through the use of triggerwords or triggerphrases, that automatically put a given website, email account, or IP on a threatlist. If a threatlist entry is flagged enough times it is put up for human review where it's put on a watchlist. Racism and talk of genocide typically aren't considered triggerworthy mostly because they are so common on the internet, it's usually just Islamist lingo and specific threats that are put on lists. Everytime someone threatens to kill Obama online, the Secret Service knows about it. The question is whether they decide to look into further.</p>
<p>In the case of al-Qaeda type websites, the whole site might get flagged, in the cases of suspicious emails or threatening/subversive online activity, only an IP or a particular account would be targeted for surveillance.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is all done with the full complicity of domestic and foreign telecom corporations, usually at the direct behest of American intelligence or diplomatic influence. I don't remember exactly what texts were covered in the classes I took, but if you're interested I can look into it. IMHO there's a line between being a dissenting voice and needlessly calling potentially hostile attention to yourself.</p>
