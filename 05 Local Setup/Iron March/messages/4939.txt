<p>Hey I noticed you said something about needing a programmer? I'm a programmer and can probably figure out a way to get the avatars working without uploading to here (and if not I do have a few VM's running in EC Cloud instances which I have no problem opening a TB or 2 for uploading), and whatever else you may need (for free of course). I've been running 2 different, very active forums for about 10 years as well ( <a href="http://stenchforums.net" rel="external nofollow">http://stenchforums.net</a> is my current forum), I'm very familiar with forum software, bulletin, php, IPB, etc. I probably wouldn't need any special privileges to do any of this, I could more than likely guide whoever is going to do it along after knowing a few things. Just figured I could offer services if you guys need it. Let me know if you do.</p>
