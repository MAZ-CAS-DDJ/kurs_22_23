<p>I still subscribe, in a sense, to a Marxist worldview. I think I'm still sort of a Marxist; I derived my anti-capitalist tendencies from there. I heard about Iron March and Stormfront on Revleft, but I derided Stormfront as KKK-type Aryan Brotherhood hillbilly bollocks. I condemned fascism outright for a long time, but I sort of grew interested in learning more about the fascist worldview. When I say I subscribe to a Marxist worldview, I mean I am a materialist still and still tend to analyse material conditions (if any "racialist" science proved to be correct, that would be material conditions nonetheless). I was always opposed to nationalism mostly due to the fact I viewed it as divisive, a way to split up the workers; I suppose a Strasserist kind of National Socialism could provide an easier way to fuck neoliberal capitalism up than a Marxist world revolution.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I can swallow certain social conservatist views that many fascists do; i.e. condemning masturbation and pornography, devoting oneself to creating a family within the same race, condemning certain types of art, etc. I'm sure I could be turned around but eh.</p>
