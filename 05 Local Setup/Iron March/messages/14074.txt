	I was wondering as London doesn't seem to do much politically, except vote Labour, and the rare demonstrations like the one against the Tories winning. But they seem to just bus them in from somewhere else. Do you know if there's a London antifa? I know their are political bookshops and such, but it just seems a migrant city and all the protesters come from universities in or around London. I wouldn't want to find any trouble in London, as it's mostly gangs.
