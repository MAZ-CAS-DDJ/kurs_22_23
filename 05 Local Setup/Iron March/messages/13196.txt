	Sure. The annals by Tacitus is great, when it comes to Germania at the very least. Varg Vikernes has two great goods, Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia (which should be read first) and then Reflections on European Mythology and Polytheism. Both can be found on Amazon. There's also his blog and youtube channel which are generally very good. <a href="https://thuleanperspective.com/" rel="external nofollow">https://thuleanperspective.com/</a> his youtube channel is the same name. There's the poetic and prose Edda, and the Havamal (easily found online) are obvious primary sources on Germanic paganism. One book that I've recently received is The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion by James George Frazer which I am looking forward to. There's also Evola's works which you're probably familiar with, as they are a great source to understand metaphysics once you get into it. The Grimm's fairytales are a good read too, although not directly related.

	If you wanna delve into Greek or Roman paganism I'm not sure of good academic works on them, but I can recommend primary sources there. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is fantastic. Then there's the classical Greek literature, such as Homer's works, of which I've read The Iliad and The Odyssey. The Aeneid of Virgil is good too.

	The way to get a good understanding of paganism is to read a lot of primary sources not necessarily related to religion, but old myths, tales, and historical works that will allow yourself to immerse yourself in their worldview and culture. That includes the philosophical works of the ancient Greeks too. To add to the bigger picture you can also delve into Hinduism, with stuff like the Bhagavad Gita but I found it a really boring and dry read.
