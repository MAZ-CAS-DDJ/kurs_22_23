<p style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">Exactly that, and I ended up making statements I regretted and having to be a whingy prick to retain a few morons who eventually jumped ship anyway. I quickly learned that mixing boxing, fitness, martial imagery and Nietzsche ONLY ever attracts likeminded people so no matter how much I tried to dress it up, the Fascist overtones had to become dominant. I don't regret it at all and our European focus has got us much further with the program of getting European fit than being "welcoming to all" ever would have.</p>

The more I read of NA and the more I expose myself to their actions, whilst there are things I'd obviously change were I to execute something similar myself, there are enormous benefits and I appreciate the severity and devotion to the cause.</p>

<p style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">Everything you said about the patriotic groups in Russia is exactly what I always envisioned with CM and our other ideas. Operation Werewolf in the USA is run by the Wolves of Vinland (www.wolvesofvinland.com / www.operationwerewolfhq.tumblr.com) and we are in close association with the founders (being prospects for a Wolves of England chapter ourselves) and their focus is 100% on creating a spiritually, mentally and physically superior Germanic elite, even if it looks quite ghetto and biker the end result is perfection.</p>

<p style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">There are ways we can and would present a "fitness meeting" or "training day" as being a civilian effort at counter terrorism and obviously we wouldn't mention National Action involvement, just ask them all to be there and learn with us.</p>

<p style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">The community we're slowly building is focused 100% on Europeans only, boxing, wrestling, strongman and powerlifting and therefore the obvious route for getting activists that are fit, healthy, drug free and aware of violence and its consequences and how to navigate the violent situation. I'm also a complete fetishist when it comes to uniformity and continuity so any program we've run had a demand for Falklands - Gulf War era British Army forest camo and knitted Special Forces balaclavas! hahaha</p>
