	You shouldn't panic because:
</p>

<ul><li>
		you're not the first to do a stickering with direct links to IM, each time the police were involved and got nothing, though they obviously had to have looked at the forum, so obviously they never got anyone's IPs, and your email is private from both registered <strong>and </strong>unregistered people
	</li>
	<li>
		leftyfags make idle threats all the time to scare you, don't give in
	</li>
</ul><p>
	 
</p>

<ul><li>
		the only thing of concern is his claim that weisse sold you out, BUT this can be all bullshit because one can browse the forum and find that weisse was banned, so it may be a lie.
	</li>
</ul><p>
	 
</p>

<ul><li>
		You only plastered some stickers, it's not that big a deal. The stickers contents are not illegal so at most they can claim vandalism which is not something to get out of shape over.
	</li>
</ul>
