	Oh man, Liberty GB and Jack Cuckby. I know certainly of Jack. I think it'll be more PEGIDA UK Tommy Robinson types than the European style GI, as GI in Europe has stepped up their act, with that barricade on the way to Calais and the numerous demonstrations in Austria with staging mock executions in public and in a theatre production made about rapeugees. They also did a banner drop ontop of a Green party head quarters in Austria with buckets of red paint meant to symbolise blood.
