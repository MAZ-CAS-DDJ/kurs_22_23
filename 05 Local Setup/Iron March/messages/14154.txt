	Thank you, it wasn't an optional thing in my case, rather do or die. AA itself contains some wonderful people, but also seems to include the very worst scum humanity produces, trust me I have more than my share of lunatics, deviants, reds and general vermin via AA, similarly I had problems with their theological positions, but I did not let it deter me as my "primary purpose" was to quit being a drunken bum.
