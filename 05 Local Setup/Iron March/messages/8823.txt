<p>Oh my goodness, well at least you got her into jewhate. What a strange combination... Savitri Devi works well for those types. I read to my mother from the Talmud, that was the most effective thing so far. She's a very... Tolerant woman. I don't waste the energy anymore. My father is a Catholic, he hates Jews and Islam, he believes in my vision of Europe. I would call him a Theocrat. My mother is a Swede with some Italian blood (Sm√•lander, Saami, and calabrese). My father is Italian and Croat. Turin and Zagorje. </p>
<p>I never listened to black metal before, I have to say I like it! Alone in the woods on a stormy night is my favorite place </p>
