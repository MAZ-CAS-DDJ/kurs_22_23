<p>Unfortunately though thanks to the media and all, fascism just manages to ingrain in the minds of everyone that it is some kind of no-fun-allowed ebil repressive regime that clamps down all things enjoyable. That's a problem which occurs with a few 'fascists' and nationalists who swallow that jewboy representation and actually act upon it; being the no fun crew burger squad (like it can be occasionally seen in the drunk thread) - the holier than thou kind of attitude that would turn anyone away from the ideology and just equate you to the rigid leftists who instantly try to shut down any non-politically correct banter. They just give the jews what they want to make the general public think that national socialism/fascism is some kind of lifeless grey rulebook that acts upon a tiny toe-out-of-line infraction. There's a gap between degeneracy and life in general which is forgotten with some people. </p>

<p>Hitler's national socialist Germany was just governed on the principles of nature, and fun is an integral part of it, lol. </p>

<p>And yeah, nowadays with the lack of information abundance on the topic of fascism/nationalism and such; or the lack of will to find it; the only way to learn properly is through the internet, so it generally attracts a few autists and misfits. I'm not going to pretend I am the ideal nationalist at the moment, and I need a lot of improvement, which I'll do. That is one of the key things about the difference between right and left in ideology - the left simply accepts failure and even encourages devolution, whereas the right can transform shitsters into good people who contribute and are entirely functioning - only people who are rejected by nature and have an impossible probability of changing are destroyed. Those fucking pony retards or furry invalids cannot be helped though, they're the product of modernity and are just entirely lost. Funny how the left loves to speak about "rehabilitation" by telling mentally unstable people to continue what they do, and other normal people to accept their destructive behaviour, meanwhile fascism and nationalism is the actual game changer in that regard - because it's work &amp; live as everyone else or fuck off to the labour camp/gas van. Tough love.</p>
