<p>I am ok. Today was a weird mix of adrenaline rushes and some utter boredom I almost confused for depression. My workout was kinda shitty too. But it sort of evened out to neutral now, talking to you helps a lot. </p>

<p>I'm particularly disappointed in all my friends right now, I wanted to take a crew along with the Degrelle postering and carry the belgian and celtic cross flags, but they all bailed and I had to go alone. </p>

<p>But now I'm just enjoying some relaxation. All is well.</p>
