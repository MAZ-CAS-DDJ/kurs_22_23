	Hey, just a quick update on this, there were some setbacks but we are still in this 100%, the only thing that has changed is that we are pushing the tentative date for beginning our work from the summer to the fall. Everything else is as expected, it's being worked on, we are going slowly to make sure everything is 100% within the law not to mention we are all new to this
