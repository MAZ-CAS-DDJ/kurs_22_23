<p>I kinda taught myself Cyrillic by listening to Russian folk metal and deciphering the song titles by listening to what is sung in the chorus (and of course by knowing some of the easier letters already). It worked. And I quickly adjusted to the slightly different Bulgarian Cyrillic.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know that it's not great, you have horribly corrupt politicians and all that, but the national economy - while being the worst in Europe - is still trending upwards rather than downwards, and you don't get hordes of refugees like we do. If things go on like this, the east will surpass the west once the full consequences of the refugee invasion hit.</p>

<p>Also, since I pretty much plan on living from what I earn by writing fantasy books, I wouldn't be bound to the local economy, and I would actually get more money in Bulgaria than I get here in Germany due to the large difference in taxation. If I do manage to get rich with my writing, I'd also like to make some investments there, and maybe found my own company (my dream is to have my own game development company, and that way I'd provide jobs to Bulgarian programmers - and in BG, jobs are needed more than here). It's way more feasible over there than in the heavily-taxed Germany, and with how much money our government is blowing on refugees, the taxes might even go higher.</p>

<p>I also appreciate the simpler, more traditional life of Eastern Europe, where traditional values are still more common than here. And I guess I've always been more Slavic than Germanic, though I have blood of both in my veins.</p>
