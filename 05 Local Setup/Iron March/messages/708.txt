<p>Like I said, they don't have formal membership it is sort of like an autonomous underground organization of people with different ideologies. It might even have roots in the crazy skinhead organization, I am not sure, but they are from what is commonly known as the American Front skinhead gang. </p>

<p>A confederation most likely. No group should be able to exercise influence over another, either pre- or post-revolution autonomy of each ethnic group should be withheld. Alls that matters is cooperation within the confederation to ensure the well being of all. </p>

The White ethos is at its most militant basically FC.  We could try to run with the David Duke Euro-American concept, but what parts of European culture do we want to claim?  I feel like the best solution would be an even further breakdown of the Union from White, Black, Brown, and Red homelands to German, English, Irish, American, etc homelands generally along the lines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Census-2000-Data-Top-US-Ancestries-by-County.svg" rel="external nofollow">this map</a>.  I understand that that is about as unrealistic a political proposition someone could make with a straight face, so I am eager to hear any alternatives you have.</div></blockquote>
<p>I can understand that position, but you are right in saying that is really unrealistic for the USA. I will address the issues accordingly. </p>
<p>1. Many European-Americans would not fit into those groups as they are a combination of various different ethno-groups. I, myself, have both German and Polish ancestry. </p>
<p>2. I see nothing wrong with European-American unity in the United States. We are all of the same race, and come from the same fatherland - Europe. While no doubt there is differences in European ethnic groups, America has always been a place where Europeans tried their luck when it all ran out in Europe. Like it or not, we are descendants of people who didn't make out so well in Europe and so it should be our duty to maintain a future here while still recognizing our noble and proud roots. </p>
<p>Lastly, we are all Indo-European (Aryan) and share way more than just genetic bonds, but spiritual, lingual, and cultural ones as well.</p>
