I hope you don't mind if I ask a couple more. Would you like to see Flanders united with the Netherlands or are you content with the Netherlands' current borders?</div></blockquote>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>As I stated on the board I see the nation as the embodiment of the people and the State as its representative. A reunification of the Netherlands with Flanders (the Dietschland concept) would certainly be a justifiable option because of the historical, linguistic and economic grounds.</p>
<p>On the other hand I wonder if there is enough popular support to justify the reunification of the Netherlands with Flanders, these sentiments are mostly found within the traditional Flemish nationalist movement. I think most people in Flanders would rather choose for an independant Flanders, than a reunification with the Netherlands. Mainly because over the centuries there certainly arose certain cultural differences and singularity among the Flemish people. So why would they after their struggle to get rid of the Walloons, choose to bind themselves to the Netherlands which also would impact their right on selfdetermination?     </p>

What are your feelings on this and more generally the relationship between the Netherlands and her current and former oversea possessions?</div></blockquote>
<p>I'm strongly opposed against imperialism and therefore my belief is that any former colony should have complete independance and selfdetermination. I also don't think the colonial history means the Netherlands has certain obligations to former colonies, in the end they have to develop and rebuild themselves without interference of foreign powers.</p>
