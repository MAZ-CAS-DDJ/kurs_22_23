<p>Interesting, I wouldn't mind an elaboration. I've become more interested in religion lately, actually. Many years ago (pre-2006) I was a hardcore atheistfag (embarrassed as fuck looking back at it.), and since then I've been more or less de-facto agnostic. There was a period where I claimed to be Deist but it I think I did not have real faith, and Deism is a lazy religion with no consequence anyway.</p>
<p>Problem with me and religion is it's hard for me to "have faith", like, say I KNOW FOR A FACT. I just could never get myself to do it.</p>
