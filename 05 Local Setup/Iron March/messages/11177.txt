<p>Atomwaffen is an ingroup of Fascist individuals across the world that have common interests and goals. We're mainly in the South, though we have a few in Europe and a Northern Chapter in Chicago Illinois. Almost all of us are on Iron March, and the guys here in Florida meet up almost every weekend to do activism and chill. </p>
