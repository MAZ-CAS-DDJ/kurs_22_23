<p>I think you are very right. I always like to seek advice from a number of people I respect, and they are all pointing the same way.</p>
<p>It's honorable to be there for others, it's something to be desired. But you are right that one should improve their own situation.. Better to help another by pulling them up than to help them by being a footstool.</p>
<p>You seem to be in a really similar boat as me. It's a hard ride, I need to take action to improve it or I will continue in this track forever.</p>
