<p>Mothers are fearful, they think they know what is best, but they only really know what is safe. On one hand, my mother would like me to be the doormat you speak of, it would be easier to explain to her friends. On the other hand, she often praises me for being helpful and uncomplaining, doing the heavy lifting and other things she can't. She surprised me recently by saying she wished she could find a man her own age like me; I told her we are either happily married or dead. Either way, she is liberal to the core and never could attract a man who is inspired by greater idealism.</p>

<p>There is nothing more attractive to me than a woman who can care for others, and it is such a rare quality today. I'll say it again: you are very special.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm sure you would give them something to never forget if they tried that again; a missing testicle perhaps?  <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>If I ever have another dog it will be a husky.</p>
<p>I did see Iron Will, I was very young and it was many years ago. I should watch it again when I'm bored.</p>

<p>Well now I'm a little jealous of him.  <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>And I'm excited for you, Portland should be excellent! Start that fascist girl gang you were speaking of on tumblr. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>All my fascist friends in Baltimore were forged by my influence, needless to say they are rather casual about it.</p>
