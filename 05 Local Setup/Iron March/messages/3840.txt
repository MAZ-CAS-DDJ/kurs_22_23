<p>This is of genuine interest, and good to know. I think if we somehow end up on a government list this way though, no human interest will ever consider to list this site as a 'threat' of any kind until any of us ever do anything. I consider at that point there will be harsh scrutiny the same way perfectly innocious organisations like leftists and anarchists are.</p>
<p>It depends what kind of budget and manpower these people have - I imagine they would rather be listening in on every muslim and right wing nutter before we were even an option. Even is somebody like torren say, went crazy and shot some people - stormfront, VNN, and a bunch of other places have managed to survive somehow. I mean if they just grabbed one of us anyway, that would probably just be it. Any intelligent person knows an active community of a hundred trogladyte posters with no siginificant background or political association.</p>
<p>Not to keep labouring the point.</p>
<p>I would be interested in sources and more information though.</p>
