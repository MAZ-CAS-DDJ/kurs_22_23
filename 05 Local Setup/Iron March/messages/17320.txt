	Hi, I am also new. I've written a rough draft of a book that I know you will find interesting. <a href="http://pastebin.com/UrCA0BBY" rel="external nofollow">http://pastebin.com/UrCA0BBY</a>

	Would be interested in some debate, although it is important to understand that debate and intellectualism is only worthwhile when it directs itself to usefulness.

	Libertarianism only works with diffused morality. We are not at that point. Freedom is only as good as the people who wield it. Psychopaths are free, but they are not moral. Morality is absolutely essential to any freedom. If people are not moral, they should not be free. Practically, we need either 1) a vast repentance of people to Jesus and traditional value or 2) a fascist government to enforce morality. I pray for the first option, but if it doesn't happen, the only way to save Western Civilization is through some type of fascism.

	Enjoy the book. Please carefully consider its arguments.
