<p>Hey Venator,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm glad to finally hear from you. To answer your question no the university I go to does not do continental philosophy. I believe this is due to the fact that it is a smaller 4 year state university and as a result the philosophy department is not very big.(Located in Missouri) However, as soon as I am able I do intend to go to graduate school, and I will make damn sure that it is one that specializes in continental philosophy. Anyways, I am so glad to hear from you and I will try to send another PM later with something we can discuss.</p>
