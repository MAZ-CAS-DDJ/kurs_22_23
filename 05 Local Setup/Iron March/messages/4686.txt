<p>I'm a British nationalist, no I am not a "Breivikist"; he, ideologically, is rather confused and has a lot of flaws- e.g, welcoming Jews as allies, declaring that even non-racial Europeans can live in Europe and fight as equals against anti-European forces etc. I admire what he has done and the determination to do what he did, that is all; I ask Norwegians because usually there is a disparity in opinion, some say he is a "coward" for attacking children - of course that is simply false and idiotic cultural marxist propaganda, and they are buying into it - or they seem to think positively of him, in my experience chatting to them. Also it makes a "welcome" post a bit more meaningful.</p>
