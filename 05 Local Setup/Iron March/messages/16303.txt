	Thanks!
</p>

<p>
	This is a very long text, and it's hard to read. :D Can I use it like this?
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	اللجنة القومية
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	الوطنية الجزائرية
</p>

<p>
	Or another format would look like this:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	اللجنة القومية الوطنية
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	الجزائرية
</p>

<p>
	I have two more questions: can I make a portrait of Abdelkader and use it together with that of El Maadi? It would look something like this (tell me if you have another historic person who could fit there!):

	The other question is about the Khamsah again. If I use it, which color should I use? On the old Emblem of Algeria it is white, on the new it is brown, and it's fingers are always pointing up, but on the internet I have seen a lot of inverted Khamsahs.

	Here is a video I found, it's about the situation of Shias in North Africa and about the historical Fatimid Caliphate:

	I think you would find it interesting especially when he talks about Algeria.
