	Good shit to hear. Honestly, I just planned on hooking up with the bookclub to see who is there and then get contacts with any potential radicals so we could branch off from it and start stirring shit with those red faggots and Zog; do legitimate activism on our own. Thanks for your honesty and the heads-up on the leaf groups, Slavros, cheers.
