<p>Ah look amazing as always.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1st I love the blue Tyr-rune, but im afraid it has to be black, and it kinda stays behind Susitaivals head so put it so that it can be seen more clearer.</p>
<p>2nd I like the idea using blue and white color as the quote is in Finnish so it fits in perfectly.</p>
<p>3rd Font is good, but mistyping error "ahjomattoman" it should be "lahjomattoman".</p>
