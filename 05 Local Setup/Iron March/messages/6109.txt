<p>It's kind of weird how it worked out that way.  I have to go to Christmas party at work so there is drinking provided .  And on New Years Eve my wife and I like to have a few drinks.  Many years ago, I used to have a big drinking problem.  I decided after many attempts at a "no alcohol" policy that only drinking in certain times is better for my mind than obsessing about it all the time.  I don't feel like I've failed at life or something.  I know that may not make much sense.</p>
