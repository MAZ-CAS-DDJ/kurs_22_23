<p>I am Racialist, actually, a racial secessionist, but not as extreme as the others and i don't have anything against jews( in religous stuff i am liberal)</p>
<p> I support a hierachy on the nation, and all the classes working for the will of the nation, and it's people. I never fully understood integralism, but it was a strong moviment here.I support eugenics against people who can't produce, and all colectivist models have my attetion. I haven't decided what i really am, but as for some readings, i am some kind of strasserist. Oh, and since you and your friend are ''rational'' i'm willing to read/hear, on opposite of those who think that you are leftists or something like that <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
