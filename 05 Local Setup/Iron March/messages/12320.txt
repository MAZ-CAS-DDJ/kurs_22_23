<p>Diet is very important, especially depending on what you want to do.  If you're wanting to cut fat off obviously getting rid of virtually all sugar is the starting point.  Also eating more fish and poultry and less red meat like pig and cow is another good starting point.  If you want to bulk, eat like a slob, especially all meats.  If you really really want to bulk, even eat junk food if you're willing to sacrifice cardio and abs.  Abs are overrated anyway.</p>
