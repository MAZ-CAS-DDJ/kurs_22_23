	Hello
</p>

<p>
	I'm wondering if you would be interested in helping me run a facebook page called "jackboot shaman". I originally named it because I felt like "jackboot shaman" really captured the focus I had for it. Unless I'm mistaken, you are the original jackboot shaman of IM notoriety.<br /><br />
	I don't have as much time as I'd like to between school and my other activities, so if you're interested in helping produce/publish content for the page, I'd be happy to welcome you aboard.<br /><br />
	Check it out and let me know if you're interested:  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JackbootShaman" rel="external nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/JackbootShaman</a>
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for your attention.
