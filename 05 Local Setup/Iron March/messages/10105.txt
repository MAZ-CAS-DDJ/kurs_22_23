<p>Honestly I have no idea. I don't even know exactly what she's been charged with. I only know that she partook in some vandalism on saturday and was arrested as we were talking on the phone sunday night.</p>
<p>I was in Jew York today, amazingly they have some really beautiful catholic churches and cathedrals and I visited a few. I made many prayers, we can only hope a few reach her. Your help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Nationalists in Europe experience real oppression, they have no first amendment to protect them and they are put in jail for thoughtcrime, and therefore a real nationalist movement actually exists; because it is opposed. The first amendment is actually the genius of this regime - you can say whatever you like, with few repercussions, until you actually organize. Now that thoughtcrime seems on its way in America we will have fewer keyboard warriors and more political soldiers; they have escalated the conflict to a new level.</p>
