<p>I know I'm probably annoying I just live out in the middle of nowhere so when I'm not working out or playing video gamkes Idk what to do </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm still staunchly pagan but I do really like praying the rosary, I memorized it when I went through a catholic phase. I've recently gotten interested in it again and bought a new rosary </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's just really meditative and calming, I like to listen to Gregorian chants and burn some candles when I do </p>
