<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">Anyway, I’m not sure what you mean by Generation Identity is ‘too commercial.’ If you could clarify, that’d be great. Personally, I think using the GI name would offer countless possibilities –primarily the fact that if we do a decent job of things we’ll automatically find ourselves networked with groups and individuals all over the place (France, Germany, Italy, Scandinavia…)</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">We’re on the same page re: being anti-bourgeois; and not favouring concrete institutions, but instead the timeless principles they ought to be based upon in the first place.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">Unfortunately, I know relatively little about Anglo-Saxondom – but I definitely like the idea. It’s important we take a pan-European Traditionalism but then give it a regional twist.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">“We should, like Alain de Benoist, come to use Left-wing ideas in the name of Right-wing principles.”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">That depends on which ideas. Could you give some examples? Many things currently associated with the Left were originally a part of the Right.</span></span></span></p>
