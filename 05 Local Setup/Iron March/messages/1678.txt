<p>At the time, when the Varyags came to power in Kiev, this town already existed. In moscow the same.</p>
<p>The Rurikids didnt came, they were called. Varyags were called Scandinavians, which came already in contact with the slavic people.(Which lived with them already)</p>

<p>Wrong. The idea of third Rome came with the orthodox religion. After Constantinople fell, there was no bastion for the orthodox faith except of moscow.</p>
<p>Moscow was the strongest country at that time with this religion. So they created some storys about the fall of constantinople like: Constantinople fell because they betrayed god. Two romes fell and the fourth shall not exist aka the third will exist forever.</p>
<p>The wedding and the eagle were subsidiary.</p>

The slavics are mentioned in 1559 by a Croat historian Stephen Srakul and later the idea of "slavic" brotherhood and so.... Later the idea of panslavic union was embraced by Ekaterina "The Grat" and Peter Ist by mean of lay Russian influence in eastern Europa states. In first versian of Panslavic bullshits there are included all Orthodox nations + (Albanians and Hungarians) after the bad reception by Albanians,Hungarians and Greek they was droped as 'Slavic" nations. So you will talk about Finns-Ugrians mythology of god Perun, Lada , Volos and so on... But a chinese dragon ???</div></blockquote>

<p>The story of big viking tribes startet with Ekaterina the Great. At that time, there were german historians who tried to germanize the slavs by rewrite the history of this country.</p>
