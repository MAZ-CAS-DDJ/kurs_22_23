	Hey Xav, let me ask you a question. Do you ever walk up to a girl you don't know (like you don't have class with) and just complement her to get the ball rolling or would she just consider you a creep. I just don't know what to do in a situation like that...because I have never had a girlfriend so....yeah. Never had a date either....Â
