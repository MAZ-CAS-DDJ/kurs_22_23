<p>i looked at all those URLS and none of them are familiar to me , although they all seem to be folkish so any could be good. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.brotherhoodofwoden.org/" rel="external nofollow">http://www.brotherhoodofwoden.org/</a>that one seems the most promising but i dont know a whole lot about the english heathen scene, if you went to some NA events there might be some heathens there. white dragon flags are always a good sign, i have one myself on my shrine  </p>

<p>mostly it was more rooted in western tradition i felt. Protestantism in america is pretty...cringey. i grew up with jesus rock songs at my church and i always preferred going to the catholic churches because they looked nice and had traditional music. i pretty much have the same opinion, most of my family isnt even christian anymore, theyre all atheists or agnostics. i also agree with your post regarding apathy and laziness, youll find on IM at least most users are active and at least do SOMETHING to help the cause instead of being armchair himmlers</p>
