<p>Hey, good to hear from you. I just wanted to make sure that you didn't resent me or something because you did that to pic or for my past (I was a mason briefly and I will always regret having ever been one in the first place). Also, yeah I never understood why people would get butthurt over a PM anyways. Also, Plato is pretty cool. I love his concept of the "guardian" elite. Which, is something I think we (the far-right) could do or would have to do in order to build our society. We get them young and teach them the philosophy of Fascism so they can live it and fight for it. I mean this was pretty much the point of the Hitler Youth. I also like how Plato's perfect society is very hierarchical. Me I am pretty much into any philosopher who has inspired the far-right. Evola and Nietzsche especially. Which in my philosophy classes and among my philosophy professors it is pretty much a given if Nietzsche comes up that I will defend him or do a paper on him. So, I guess I'm pretty Nietzscheian. I hope to teach as well. I'm sure that you have seen my posts about it before but it is pretty much my dream to be a Fascist/Far-right intellectual. Intellectual for lack of a better term. Hey, if you do get into game design please design something were you can actually play as a German solider or SS man (FPS), with an actual campaign and story. Also, sorry but I am a consule pleb. Please let me know if you get this.</p>
