<p>I would only partially agree with you. I think the worst aspects of feminism have become ingrained in our society. Unfortunately I don't seem many women taking up their places at the feet of the men they marry. A woman's duty should be service to her man first and foremost and I think many "modern" women believe they are equals to men. Of course, this is just my opinion. Are you married Sir?</p>
