<p>Funny, My father never went to Doctors either and it almost made me parentless 2 years ago.</p>
<p>He woke me in the middles of the night and said he was having pains, but not in his stomach.</p>
<p>Even then he was apprehensive even though he's the one who brought the idea up of going to the Hospital, which like i said he never does so that convinced me it was something serious.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After driving him to the hospital and waiting for a long time (This was in the middle of the night after i had went to sleep late), We found out he had a heart attack and after some fibbing on my dads part the doctors decided he should go to the City Hospital as they had better facilities for him their.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Few days later he gets a stint put in and afterward, while a lot of the close family(My two sisters, and two of my nieces) were talking to him he passes out and starts snorting air and sucking his chest. Going into Cardiac arrest, my family freaks out and they all start crying while the doctors rush in, im trying to calm them down and remain calm while my Father was basically dying in front of us, right after we thought all the worst had past.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I kept my composure for them and checked in on dad after that had ressucitated him, before the girls came in, later on they moved him to overwatch or whatever. One of my Nieces asked me how i was so calm, i said something about how someone has to be functional in stressful times like this, and that was it really. I was stressed, wired, anxious and terrified, i just controlled the wildfire of emotions and tried to keep my wits about me and not give in to panic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More of the family arrived hours later and it wasn't until i relayed what happened then that my veneer cracked a little.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He's doing fine now for the time being. So it worked out the best it could.</p>
