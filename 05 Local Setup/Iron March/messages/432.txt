<p>Thanks for answering my question.  I hope you don't mind if I ask a couple more.</p>
<p>Would you like to see Flanders united with the Netherlands or are you content with the Netherlands' current borders?</p>
<p>If I remember correctly some of the Dutch colonies in the Caribbean were integrated into the Netherlands as special municipalities a few years back.  What are your feelings on this and more generally the relationship between the Netherlands and her current and former oversea possessions?</p>
