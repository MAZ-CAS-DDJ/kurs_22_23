<p>I don't know, I'm tempted to try and tease you by saying I don't think God's laws were meant to be interpreted in a relativistic way but I don't really care, I'd only be doing it to annoy you. ^^</p>

<p>The only thing I've ever stolen on purpose was a "Radiation: warning!" sign with a trefoil on it. Cause, you know, I thought looked cool. I was about 13, my father bought me my first ski mask for it. I'm actually not sure what the place was, but I think it was related to the telecom system. It was close to our house and every time I rode past it on my bike I could see this sign. (cause I grew up in a rural area, I used to ride through "the bush" as we call it all the time and find places) Anyway, I cut through the fence to this place, climbed up to where the sign was, detached it, flipped off the security camera and made my daring escape. It was pretty fun, I understand why people like heisting banks.</p>

<p>Do you think god will forgive me, was my need for the sign great enough?</p>

<p>Anyway don't get caught next time. If you go to prison you'll have a whole mound of lesbians on you as if you were made of honey. You're too cute.</p>

<p>Yes, bulgaria, and yes this shit started just after we broke up. Have you ever loved somebody and wanted to kill them in equal parts?</p>

<p>Totally random thing to share, do you like Warren Zevon?</p>
