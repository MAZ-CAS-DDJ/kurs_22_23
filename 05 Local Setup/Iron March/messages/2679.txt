<p>We disagree, and likely we will disagree in the future. But I count you as an intelligent man and I like our discussion.</p>
<p>You are one of the few people I actually enjoy debating with. I am rude sometimes in debates, but ultimately I respect you. My use of arrogance is merely to determine if an opponent is respectable. </p>
<p>I like you, NSP. Even if we will always disagree, I always like intelligent people. I may mock your arguments (call this primal male stupidity if you will-- but it is a sign of respect for me), but I respect them and you.</p>
<p>Hopefully, if our disagreements are too profound, we can discuss them in messages, and reach a consensus sooner.</p>
<p>Ik spreek je snel</p>
