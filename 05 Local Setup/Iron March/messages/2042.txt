<p>Well US soldiers dont count they shit in any place they go....</p>
<p>"If only we had nationalists were as good as the nationalists of Europe and of Russia"</p>
<p>Nationalism is something that must be build it is not a national patriotism though and that you dont have a already build doctrine is just fine you have an perfect oppurtunity to model it right not like Russian, Serbian, Romanian... which is higly religious grvitating all around the church and stuff you can model it without internationalism and shits... Like Hitler did do you read "My struggle" ?</p>
<p>"long as they don't fuck things up"</p>
<p>You know that there is no how this not happen,,, In socialism we sheltered some Vietnamese refugees back then and in the beginning all is fine: Red Brothers, Equality, Workers Unite kinds of stuff... but just in five years they menaged to make us hate and finaly throw them away... In one country have place only for one nation... With very little exceptions i mean when you have different ethnic group but in you culture something like "Sub culture" , "sub nation" in a good meaning like we have with Chuvashians and Gagauzians.. I dont know if you understand me this is rooted in Iranian culture when some other nations or small ethnic groups willingly came under your rule and adopt your culture and be proud of it.. Its complicated the bots sides benefict of it and dont mixed up and pff its very dificult for me to explain to you it was common in middle Asia in medieval time when some Turkic tribes become "sub nations" with Iranians it is different of enslavement and so...</p>
<p>But this is only way two nations to live in one country and not to cut their throats all the time...</p>
<p>Well yes when RA2 come i was 13-14 years and with my friends play it multiplayer all nights in game clubs..   Now i dont have many time for games (work,family..) but yes its relaxing when you smashed somebody's head in GTA but i prefer Postal 2 its kind of more violence..</p>
