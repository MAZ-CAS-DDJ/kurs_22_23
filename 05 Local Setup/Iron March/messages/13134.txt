	Hey Akhnaton,
</p>

<p>
	This is Blackshirt 13 here. I just wanted to let you know that I just finished Vol 1 of the LOTGH novel today. I liked it and I am glad to say that the animated series is pretty faithful to the novel/s. Vol 1 ends with setting the stage for the events to come in Vol. 2 mainly the imperial civil war and the coup within the alliance. If you have any other questions let me know.

	Hail,
