<p>Again, kind of funny, cause' drinking was one of the smaller problems with Her, too. She stopped drinking when she was with me because I didn't like it. Eventually she started drinking in secret. The drinking itself never caused a problem, it was just that she lied to me about it. Again, she told me how "cool I was for being straight edge and how i was really good for her and how she wanted to be like me, etc" shit like this still really confuses me, she was obsessed with me for the longest time. I don't think I'll ever be able to explain what happened, women be crazy.</p>

<p>The thing that has always attracted me about Europe and being a European is being able to say: "This is my land. My people have always been here. Not anybody else." I've always wanted to feel really patriotic about my country, but I just can't do that about this colony. No history, asians and natives who make up about half the population where I live have more or less the same claim to the land I do. I need muh blood and soil. Side note? I fuckin' HATE Australian weather. The average temperature where I live on a normal day is 35-40 degrees C. Not sure what that is in yankie terms but it's bloody hot. I've grown up here all my life and I've always wanted to live in a forest, with snow. Our family travelled around the south of Australia when I was young and I'd stand outdoors when It was almost freezing in a tshirt while my father was shivering wearing a jacket and tease him... But now I'm really rambling.</p>

<p>My slav fetish I've always had, since I was <em>really</em> young, way before I was into politics. Most of my friends are slavs. Yeah, we only talk online but they are still my closest friends. I relate much easier to slavs than westerners. They are also much easier to <strike>brainwash</strike> teach about fascism. I think the average east euro understands some basic fundamental truths that westerners have forgotten. They are a more healthy people... You know, apart from the krokodil.</p>

<p>Don't feel too bad, I used to listen to Russian rap some years ago. I didn't like rap then, or now, but I just loved the sounds of Russian voices. It's such a great accent and language that i'd listen to music for that reason alone. Otherwise, yep, metalhead. I was going to show you my fancy new youtube next but you're too fast for me! Anything there you like so far?</p>

<p>What is your religion/ worldview/ wants in a family if you don't mind me asking? Y'know, apart from "fascism" I guess. What made this guy special to you?</p>
