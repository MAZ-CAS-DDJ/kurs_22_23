<p>Whait, has the Great Leaders Propaganda lied to me? You cant do anything at once?</p>
<p>Ok, enough bad jokes from me. Last question, the Iron March Radio, i cant lisent to it, apparently i am disconnected.</p>
<p>Is this Radio only active sometimes wich explains why i cant lisent to it? Something i need to download? Would really like to kill some time whit lisenting to IMR, And at the same time learn something and enjoying the good music.</p>
