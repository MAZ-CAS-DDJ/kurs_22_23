<p>there's not many places i can try this but you know how posters don't stick well to flat surfaces (like bus stops and that newsstand) due to the non porous material?</p>
<p>what if you took an exacto knife and scratched a little grid over the area where the poster was going, it would help the poster stick on and be harder to tear off. </p>
