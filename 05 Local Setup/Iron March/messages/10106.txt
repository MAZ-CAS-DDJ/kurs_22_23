<p>You should find out man. Hopefully shes not in really big trouble but I have no clue, she lives in Oregon right? I actually kinda remember a post she made, was that the vandalism? </p>

<p>Yeah I've been to New York and I remember they have really nice churches. Have you been to the national cathedral in Washington DC? It was the first cathedral I had ever been in and I literally cried. I really love cathedrals more than most things in the world, they're so tranquil and beautiful. I remember rosaries, cathedrals and gregorian chants being my favorite things about Catholic religion. </p>

<p>Yeah I see what you mean now. I know Swedish NatSoc friends who have to be EXTREMELY careful, I suggested a few come over to IronMarch and they said it could put their jobs on the line.

<p>Things in America are about to get very interesting for sure. I know I will have a part to play no matter how great or small. If I lead a chapter in california, so be it. If I go out in a martyr shooting, so be it. I will serve my ancestors and the gods however I can</p>
