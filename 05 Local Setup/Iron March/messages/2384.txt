<p>I see.</p>
<p>To me, Progressiv Nationalsozialismus is the adaptation of National Socialism of the 1920s to a country today.</p>
<p>I find mostly Americans and American neo nazis, or non Germanic/semi Germanic Germanophiles support a kind of NS that has nothing to do with the practice. They only use the racialist theory.</p>
<p>For Germany, I believe in German cultural heritage. To me, this includes Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and maybe some Odinists/German Pagans.</p>
<p>I believe that German success is a result of these ideologies, so I consider them German. And I consider movements that oppose them to be anti German, rather.</p>
<p>I say 1920s because this was Naziism before "anti semitism" toward non Christian Germans. Having read books of Göbbels diary, I am aware that he was named after a Jewish friend of his family, and his favorite professor was Jewish. He also would chastise occasionally on anti semitism.</p>
<p>Obviously, this position changed mostly for political expediency. And Hitler, who did not want to kill Jews or legislate against them, was urged by Göbbels. Hitler almost never did anything of his own that persecuted Jews.</p>
<p>But ultimately, it is an adapted form of NS that I believe in. Something that Germans believe in, and not Americans, who are racial revisionists with liberals.</p>
