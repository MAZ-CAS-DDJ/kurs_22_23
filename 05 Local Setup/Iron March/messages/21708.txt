	My thinking is that if Natural Law is not respected then the System is the one prevailing in temporal affairs - nature continues as per usual but theres all sorts of depravity, degeneracy and well many consequences until the laws of Nature are fully respected and actualized in practice (i.e not defiled) - e.g territory, biological integrity, leadership, status &amp; motherhood instead of whoredom as GLR put it. Only gangs or communities far out of the systems reach operate flawlessly in tune with that. The paragraph is talking about whether it prevails (i.e accepted or practiced by most people) when it comes to consciousness, since free will opens the possibility to live unnaturally (i.e to have a choice and to choose wrong - for which there are infinite). I have said this to others IRL but haven't found the right words as of yet (and yes they always raise similar complaints).
