<p>Yeah so after I went crazy I stopped logging on for almost a week, and I spent many sleepless nights intensely involved in the study of the occult. </p>
<p>I read some of Crowley's books among other things shhhhh don't say anything he has a negative reputation here, but in his books he had some pretty good ideas pretty good arguments on what is and isn't spiritual. I did some heavy research into the origins of pentagrams and other stuff like the kabbalah I can link you some of the stuff if you want. Its not Jewish like you think. </p>
<p>I have decided to devote my time to occult studies ( well my free time) I'm also taking a Metaphysics class and a Hebrew Bible class at the moment. I think I'm going to stop posting on here because its kind of a distraction but I will still talk on chat if you want to discuss anything occult.</p>
<p>I honestly have been getting disillusioned with fascism, this site introduced me to Evola something I had never read before but I don't think its for me, </p>
<p>in all honesty I miss my old conception of Fascism and National Socialism which involved an aspiration for something greater a study of the Occult not a sinking depression of waiting for a rebirth. Hitler had a very specific idea in mind and I don't think this sight nor any neo-nazi fully understands the path he was going it was something divine.</p>
<p>That being said I must be great full for this sight as it gave me knowledge of a different viewpoint , however I think it's time I returned to my true self my inner self.</p>
