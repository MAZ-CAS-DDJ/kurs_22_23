<p>The fact you wanted to stay with him before he left is good, loyalty is the best trait in a woman.</p>

<p>Escaping to some rural area of the Balkans would be perfect. I don't know much about Croatia apart from NDH and ustase and that though. Cause houses were so cheap, I wanted to buy us one in Varna, her home town, away from the city. She'd moved to Sofia for university and to be with her first boyfriend who is just very lucky we were not in the same country at the same time because I would have cut his fucking eyes out for the way he treated her when they broke up, but I digress.</p>

<p>The rest is a pretty long story. At the risk of sounding gay again, I don't think there was another more perfect couple in the world, we were so similar and got along so well in every way you could name (we'd even decided on the name of our firstborn son, that's how long we were together). There ended up being some problems, I don't know how to give the short version... Not that I want to think about this more anyway... but, she was disloyal and dishonest in a few ways. Again, I'm not sure how to explain but I decided I had to leave her, despite wanting very much for everything to be fine and for us to be together so it was hard for me. First love. None of my friends understood how I was acting, they thought I was being kind of faggy and beta about the whole situation. It's not like that, though. I've never had a problem making girls like me- I've always been perfectly handsome and charismatic (and modest ofc) but I loved <em>her</em> and I wanted <em>her</em>, not any other woman I've met before or since.</p>

<p>Before this I always used to follow the "Well if a girl wrongs you just slap her, throw her away and find a new one, duh!" mindset. Now I'm kind of confused. I'm not sure if I'm just overly romantic of if guys who say this have just never had proper love before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Speaking of mentally ill people, she was too. Nothing diagnosed, but I'm 99% confident she has literal autism, or some similar disorder. She was cripplingly bad at social situations and had problems with other stuff. I think I might have a thing for sick girls, though. I always liked helping her. She used to tell me how perfect I was for being "assertive and honest and loyal and the kind of person who'd never cheat" and how good I was for her etc, which all seems like a bit of a joke now really.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When? Late last year... Literally on my birthday it started. Yeah, best not to get into that either. The saddest thing is the lovespoon I made for her that she'll never get now.</p>

<p>On a cheerier note, what kind of music do you like, lass?</p>
