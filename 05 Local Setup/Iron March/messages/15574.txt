	Of course Kadyrov is a puppet of Putin, but that's how it works.

	I don't think that any Traditional religion is Satanic. Remember:
</p>

<p>
	"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them."
</p>

<p>

	For me that means that Judaism is not inherently Satanic (see the Old Testament), only they are the easiest to contaminate. That's why Satan using them as his servants, but there are some Jews who are against this. Don't think my friend that if all of the Jews would magically disappear we would live in the Havens (though sometimes I feel like that): Satan will always be able to possess the weakest, we just talked about Vatican II - and nowadays there are Catholic priests who admire that faggot "woman with a beard" in Austria, or supporting "gay marriage" (which is an absurd concept). The Orthodox are thinking the same about Catholicism what you think about Islam, only they don't say it's inherently barbaric, but that it's inherently decadent.

	I have to research theology more, but I think that Islam is the maximum which the Arabic race is capable of, and the maximum of Islam, Sufism has a lot in common with Christian mysticism.

	I know we fought against Muslims, and at that time I would fought against them as well, since they wanted to destroy us. But today, there is an even greater power, which is against all religions and all traditions, and remember, we always have to see clearly: we have fought against Russia, today they are our natural allies against the decadent West. A lot of Poles fought against Fascism, today we know it was a mistake, just like Horthy's standpoint against Sz√°lasi. Enemies will become allies while we are facing bigger and bigger threats to all of us. I don't support Islam against Christianity. I support it against Modernism.
