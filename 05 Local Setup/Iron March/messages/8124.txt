<p>Hi, I'm contacting  you since you're a veteran in this forum and are on my friend list.</p>
<p>Since I started studying about fascism and nationalism I have always failed in understanding the concept of race, I know there are tons of discussions about that in this forum, but the search system sucks and I'd prefer to speak with someone who already knows those concepts and ideas.</p>
<p>My question is, what do you mean by 'race'? If we talk on a biological level we know that there are a lot of controversies and it was proved that genetically our DNA is pretty similiar and our facial traits for example don't make us of a different race. I want to know what's the actual idea of racea nd if it's meant to be considered more as a spiritual difference between populations rather than a physical and biological one.</p>
<p>If I'm involved in a debate I cannot really talk about race, people would show me the scientific proofs that there isn't such thing and logically speaking they would be right and I would be arguing about pseudo-science. What should I read about these matters?</p>
