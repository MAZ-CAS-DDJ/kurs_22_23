<p>Don't you have to be like 21 years old in USA to even legally buy alcohol? Anyway, girls shouldn't drink much IMO. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> It's more like a test of manliness here. It's just that alcohol is in our culture and I always enjoyed a good drink. Don't see that much wrong with it.</p>

<p>You mean diving like jumping from that platform or something like this?</p>

<p>How's your Croatian going, have you tried to learn or you didn't have time for it? As I said, I'm willing to help.</p>

<p>I'm going to work mostly, I don't think I will go anywhere. I actually managed to find a nice place to use as a personal gym, put two punching bags there, weights and some other stuff. I'll mostly train boxing with my friends in free time, I'm really looking forward to it. I just had a nice sparring match, drank few beers and watched football. Can't ask for much more really, if entire summer will be like this it will be great.</p>

<p>I'm just curious, how did you "find" "fascist" views and all that, you have any friends with similar views?</p>
