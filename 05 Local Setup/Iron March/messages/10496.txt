<p>I in no way doubt your love for the Ahlul Bayt good sir, the hanafis of the region have a long history of loving them. And in no way do I think that being Sunni excludes one from loving them and learning from them. The Hanafi school is actually one of my favorite madhabs alongside the Maliki.</p>
<p>As for Christians in the order; there have always been Christian Sufis. The Rosicrucians were formed specifically because of the teachings brought back to Europe from the Sufis. People often times recognize haqq but do not wish to leave their customs or traditions of their people.</p>

<p>I've heard of Christians visiting the dargahs of sufis back in the days, like, some 700 years ago where Mawlana called upon even the Majus or the greatest sinners to come to his dargah, and Taptuk Emre accepted Christians to hear and observe his sohbets, but in the modern times, I cannot imagine that the lines can become so blurred as to allow Christians and Muslms to study under the same master to reach an objective truth in spirituality.</p>
