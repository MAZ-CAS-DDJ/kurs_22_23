<p>There are always positions available as a regular department worker in which case you just have to choose the department that you think you'd do best at (graphic designs, videos, writing).</p>
<p>As for limited spots, those would be department heads. Imagery department is already taken, press department is currently being applied for by the new fellow, so that leaves the video department. If you want to apply for either press or video department head spots then you'll have to cough up some examples of your work in the appropriate skill, so that I can evaluate it and decide if you fit the bill.</p>
<p>If you choose regular worker spot you'll be answering to your department head, if you choose department head then you answer to me. Department heads must organize the work of their department and fulfill the assignments that I may hand down to it, like making a specific video, image series or writings.</p>
<p>For the time being the ministry is virtually empty so there won't be any projects until we get more people onto the site and applying for the ministry which means for the time being propaganda work is in free-flow, i.e. do whatever you think may help.</p>
