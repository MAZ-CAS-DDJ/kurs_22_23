	Still messing with the black colorway, but that isn't bad at all. I still really like the second black flag you sent on Instagram, especially with the circle banding around the Eagle,Â and it would fit in well with other potential flags that would be brought to demonstrations (White Pride Worldwide, <abbr title="National Action"><abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr></abbr>, etc.)
