His oldest known ancestors Đorđe, known as Ljota and Toma Dimitrijević came from the village of Blac, now in Greek Macedonia, in first half of 18th century. First they settled in a village of Krnjevo, close to town of Smederevo. Around 1750’s these two brothers built a wooden church in Krnjevo and dedicated it to saint George, their patron saint. At the end of 18th century, they resettled to Smederevo. According to the legend, in their house leader of first Serbian uprise, Đorđe Petrović Karađorđe, recived keys of Smederevo fort from the Turks. The family of Ljotić stayed loyal to the Karađorđević dinasty till the end. Dimitrije’s father, Vladimir Ljotić, had to leave Serbia in 1868, because he was wanted as conspirator against Obrenović dynasty, a rival dynasty to Karađorđević. He returned only after the abdication of of king Milan Obrenović in 1889, when first radical government of Sava Grujić was formed. Already in 1890 he was appointed as Serbian consul in Salonika. Later, Vladimir Ljotić was the president of Smederevo municipality and member of parlament. Between 1904. and 1909. he was again a consul in Salonika. He died in 1912.<br /><br />As stated before, Dimitrije Ljotić was born in 1819 in Belgrade. He finished grade school in Smederevo, where he enrolled in high school. Upon relocation of his family to Salonika, Dimitrije Ljotić bearly 16 years old, graduated in Serbian high school of Salonika, approved by the ministry of foreign affairs. In his early youth, in part because of his parents influence and part because of the books he read, Dimitrije became very religious. He was thinking of becoming a priest and to drop out of faculty of law, but because of his fathers disapproval he gave up on that idea. His understanding of Christianity partially matched that of Tolstoy, in context of total refusal of defiance to evil. He begame a vegetarian, abstainer, devoted with his whole being to the purity of Christ. He went so far with it that in times of regrutation for the Balkan war, we was determined to refuse to give the oath. Luckly for him, the time for giving oath never came as he was underage. However, in order to express his patriotism, Dimitrije Ljotić volunteer to the medical service. During Balkan wars he worked in quarantines and healed the people infected by typhus.<br />In autum of 1913. he went to Paris, where he stayed until the break of first world war. His trip to Paris was the idea of king Peter I who wanted to prepare him for diplomatic service, and education in France was a thing of prestige.<br />In Paris, his commitment to monarchism and his rightist spirit developed more and more. He often visited the meetings of French royalists, and on one of those meetings he said:<br />„All the more we should be monarchists, because we have our own national dynasty!“<br /><br />On his return to Serbia on 1st of September 1914, he recived a call to army. With it, as one of 1300 corporals, survived the Albanian golgotha and recovered from it on island of Corfu. During the pursuit of Germans and Bulgarians through Serbia, Dimitrije was wounded on Ovčije field. After all his combat experience, Dimitrije lost his sense of pacifism he had before. After the end of the war he was appointed commander of the railway station in Bakar (between Rijeka and Zadar). His observation of Croat peasants from Bakar and Serbs in military was interesting, seeing how in first days Croats were more for Yugoslavia than the Serbs were. That changed dramatically very quickly. For that drastic change in Bakar, Ljotić blamed the Jews who, exploiting the hunger that was present in first days of new country, with usury begun to get rich.<br />On 16th of April 1920, strike of railwaymen broke out and communist party of Yugoslavia was behind it. Their intention was to prevent the delivery of ammution that was intended against Bela Kun’s Hungary, and on the other hand with prevention of demobilization to instigate riot in military among reservists. Dimitrije broke the strike in Bakar in a single day, arresting 36 railwaymen sending them all to the authorities. He was demobilized in 17.6.1920. In Bakar he found his future wife Ivka with who he had three children.<br />After demobilization he returned to Smederevo where he opened hiw lawyer office after he graduated in Belgrade in 1921 He joined People’s radical party and soon became president of it’s youth wing. From 1926 he was considered a dissident by some circles in the party because of his deep religious stances. As party dissident, Dimitrije Ljotić ran for the parlament in 1927. On these elections he won 5614 (19,7%) of votes and it wasn’t enough for him to win the seat, while in his hometown of Smederevo Democratic party won. This was the last time he ran as a candidate of the regime’s party. In his later political work he would deal with criticism of Yugoslavian regime and it’s work.<br />Today he is most remembered for his role in warn-torn Serbia during second world war, trying to salvage anything he could from the mistakes of his predecessors.<br />This short biography is just an intro for a series that would show the character and the work of this unique man in modern Serbian history<br /></p></blockquote>
