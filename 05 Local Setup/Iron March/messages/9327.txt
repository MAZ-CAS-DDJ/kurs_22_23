<p>Ok I've been using your tips, but I ran into a problem.  For the first couple days I could reach 3500/4000 no problem, but I'm running out of food fast because most of it was frozen/processed crap.  So what foods would be good to buy in bulk that don't take 30 years to prepare?  Also on the smoothies do you just mean protein shakes, or is there more to it?  I do MMA classes where I take 30 minute striking classes on monday and thursday.  Should I cut down on that or is just in taking more calories enough?</p>
