	It's pretty easy just look at society and all the shit they do on a basic level and it's very clear to see the problem lies in the woman's very nature fundamentally. They are manipulative , fickle , un-creative and the very core of humanistic and liberal viewpoints. They are what drags down our modern society, in the past men ruled without question , men disciplined women that got out of hand. We didn't have such degeneracy , men ruled,  women and children listened and obeyed.
