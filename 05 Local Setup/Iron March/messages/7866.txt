<p>I had a fit to Thailand 2 weeks ago and made it back here without being caught. Like yourself funds are low after that trip and I make money on a case by case basis out here. People seem to think I'm rich because I scammed a rich liberal and a Jew, but I put all of that money towards my daughter's future as I know the situation is likely to be even worse when she's grown up. Hopefully by the summer time I'll have plenty more cash to spare, it's definitely a plan on the table.</p>
