<p>Especially Salubrious Living, since it's written by one of our own Ben Klassen and has some really good stuff in it.</p>

<p>I know I tell a lot of people about high fat and low carb diets, but when competing all the athletes are on high carb diets for the extra burst of energy. Just check out Michael Phelps' and Rick Hatton's diets. They have a stimulant effect. Junk food diets along with cocaine, striped socks, synthesizers and courage were the foundations of the golden era of humanity, the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

<p>Most athletes, weightlifters in particular follow junk food diets very often but when asked about nutrition they would 'advise' people the normal stuff that most nutritionists go along with, same as they'll turn around and tell you they're not juicing. It's not the exact healthiest way but carbs do work if you're in competition.</p>
