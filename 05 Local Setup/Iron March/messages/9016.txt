<p>Yeah they are pretty shit, better than nothing, they weren't up when I got down there, I wasn't hopefull with the amount of the traitor class that roll up for their faux lamentation, one thing that pisses me off the most about Anzac Day, everyone is sad and not furious at what's become of the spirit of the diggers, they shit on the spirit of war and adventure, national self sacrifice and replace it with disgusting humanitarianism and pacifism...anyway il wheat paste the rest up and well see if Kalash can't sort out some pro stuff, would be easy as fuck to make that change to the stencil too..catch any blue fin? Went spear fishing last break but didn't catch bugger all, will try this weekend and put it in the hunting club thread, I don't think many IM'rs venture out of their city's enough to contribute there haha so it seems anyway. </p>
