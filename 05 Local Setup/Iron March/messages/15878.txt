	I just feel so weird after reading 3 chapters into the Mental Liberation manual, I <b>genuinely</b> thought fascists were absolute evil two years ago and now I can't even understand why two days ago I gave a shit that my area was full of liberals. Do you guys have any online hangouts where I can actually talk with you?
