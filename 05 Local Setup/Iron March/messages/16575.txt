	I thought that that como looked familiar. And yeah I wear a black M65 field jacket when it starts to get cold, and I always have that pin on it too. Also, it looks like I may or may not be able to get one of those hats after all. I am kind of having a hard time finding one in my size and they are actually kind of expensive. So, I'll just have to see I guess. Anyways, while were here have you ever read any of Varg's books? Also, I know you use to be kind of a gamer so I thought I would just ask but do you know any games that don't completely butcher the Norse world or Norse mythology (although if we actively worship the old gods then I guess to us it would be mythology then?) ? Though, I am still doing research on paganism so I guess I am not actively worshiping yet. Though, I do pray to Freya from time to time.
