	Also, as an idea, we were thinking of getting wearable cameras during any flash demos or rallies that we'll have, as a form as security from police as much as anything else. Of course the cops might just laugh and take the camera, but we'll livestream the footage onto a private server. It would make sense to tell the police this ahead of time as well. Do you think it would be worthwhile sending an email to the police saying 'AR will be holding a demo today, we will be wearing cameras which will be streaming footage to a private server. Make sure the police behave in a lawful manner' or words to that effect? Not telling them where we'll be, but just increasing our chances of the police not pulling England tier zog on us
