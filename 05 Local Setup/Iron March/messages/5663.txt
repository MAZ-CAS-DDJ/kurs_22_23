Although I am adherent of Italian fascism with a some BUF/Mosley thrown in, I do believe that the N.S. economics, originally of Feder, are THE economics of fascism that have a proven track record of success. I also feel the "Die Neue Stadt" of 1939, the fore=runner of garden cities is an idea society has let lie dormant, except in Japan. The Brits dabbled with the concept a little in the '30s (Letchworth and Welwyn being the first 2 examples) but let that peter out.</p>
