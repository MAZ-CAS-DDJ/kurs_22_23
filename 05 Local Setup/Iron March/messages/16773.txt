	Oh, well I am sorry to hear that. Hope you get a job teaching English soon. So, is there a big demand for that in Serbia then?  Heh heh, well if you end up delaying watching LOTGH for too long maybe you could just watch the new series when that comes out (whenever the hell that will be). Or just watch both for comparison, which is what I will do having already the original. Supposedly, the new version will follow the novels more closely. Speaking of I finally got a hold of the 3 novel, but probably won't get to read it for a while because there are other things on my list.
