	It is good thing that it was possible for Muslims to withstand Modernism since 1922 (fuck Mustafa Kemal), but it's probably because of their relative isolation (that's why I am planning a trip to the untouched places of Asia). The 'Arab spring' was a clear sign of what happens if those people are no longer protected from the modern world.

	Me and my friends were listening to an almost 4 hours long debate between a philosopher from Egypt who had to leave his home because of his hatred towards Islam and now is living in Hungary, and a Hungarian imam (a very rare thing to see here), and we though that the latter was lying when he was talking about the Humanism and Egalitarianism of Islam. It looks like that we were wrong and those germs you are talking about are undeniably there. I will have to make a research on that; you see, my knowledge is not that great after all, both of us can learn from each other.

	And this is the perversion of the idea of "Jedem das Seine"; here you can clearly see how the original meaning was something good, and how its modern interpretation reversed that. Sometimes the wrong intent is not even needed in this process and it happens only by the fact that Involution manifests itself in the language too. That's how f.ex. Hedonism become something associated with guzzling and orgies: originally, Hedonism meant that you want to achieve pleasure, but the meaning behind this word was different, it was something like experiencing beauty (as an ideal as in the same episode of Mysterium Fasces I linked above, between 41:45 and 47:37), the fact that it causes euphoria was just a side effect. Like, I am enjoying these talks, but the joy itself should never be my goal, but only a side effect which comes along with the fact that we are getting closer to the Truth. I think this was interpreted by another rationally paradoxical teaching of Christ:

<p>
	Of course. Always watch out for this. I mean, if somebody says to you that everything means its opposite he is either dead wrong or a liar. There was a saying, which follows: "<strong>not everything</strong> is what it looks like". Now that's true, but when they change it to "<strong>nothing</strong> is what it looks like" it becomes a bullshit. There are countless wrong paths, but there is a few which are leading to our goals. Don't believe to those who are overconstruing everything; it's true that in our age oversimplifying is widespread, but overcomplicating is also a deviation. Keep up the balance between those two.

			But even then, they're not unified in this behavior of a uniform horde of primitive warriors either, but in fact they're split in half: one half consists of the ruthless slaves you mention, while the other half consists of degenerate slaves who masturbate to American porn while bragging about their Givenchy bags and Mercedes cars.

They are like the forefathers of the Burgers, giving up their identity for an easier life. Fucking immigration... if we are letting them in, they will create something like ISIS, if we are sending them back they will modernize Islam back in their home countries. Gassing them would be nice.

	I am glad to hear it. Thinking in trinities rather than dualities is quite helpful most of the time: God is neither Chaos nor Order, but their synthesis what can be achieved through Order. The ultimate man is neither male nor female, but their synthesis what can be achieved by the male (also their synthesis is not the unity of a half-male and a half-female, like in some cases in our era; but the unity of a full male and a full female, represented by traditional families in reality, and by the mythological Androgynos in the ideal world).

<p>
	You see the situation clearly, and you are also right in your conclusion. I was talking with Kaci Mohand and he said that while his home Algeria is officially Sunni, it has a large presence of Sufi mystics. (Hungarian Traditionalists are saying the same thing about Turkey, there are people in high offices who are against the heritage of the Modernist-Chauvinist-Secularist bastard Mustafa Kemal, and who want to build a Traditional Turkey.) You were talking about how there are no official leaders in the Sunni world - maybe that's not a problem if we could influence the masses by helping the spiritual elite taking the major positions in secret. That could be a model for every country in the future.
</p>

<p>
	I haven't read that book by Savitri Devi but it looks interesting. You could be right about Akhenaten - perhaps he tried to merge the cults like the Abrahamic religions did later. Perhaps if he had done it in a different way today we would still have the original Egyptian civilization which I admire.
