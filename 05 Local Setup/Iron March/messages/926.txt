<p>Exactly, ethnic nationalism (and most of the "traditionalist" or "fascist" philosophies) may work perfectly well for Europe, but America is an entirely different creature. There are only a few nations that have existed in a similar manner with similar conditions. Greece had a closer system of government but the Persians had a similar view on the concept of ethnicity. Rome combined these two ideas and it is because of this that I feel Rome is the best model of the logical conclusion of the American system. </p>
<p>Rome tends to be the kind of symbolic basis for many fascist thinkers, however, I find it ironic that the nation most often despised as being a sort of liberal cesspool has much more in common with Roman and Roman rule than many other modern States.</p>
