<p>I know you will probably disagree with me on a lot of economic issues, I am not a capitalist but I am definitely not a communist or even a hard socialist. That is really neither here nor there. I just wanted to say I have a lot of respect for you for standing by your convictions. Especially when you are constantly berated here. You know what you are talking about. Don't let the red faction on here dissuade you. It is good to hear perspectives from all aspects. Even the racist and capitalist ones. </p>
