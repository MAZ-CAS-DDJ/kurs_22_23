<p>Certainly man, I'd be interested in collaborating as much as my time allows. I'm still in-country til about June or so, but I get some downtime here and there. The fighting season is kicking off right now, though, so I can't guarantee my availability much, other than to simply say that, yes, I'd be glad to help with the article.</p>
