	Last year there was a conference the day before with merch and stuff which was very interesting. As of any parties - dunno, we ourself were a somewhat huge group, we also met some croats and romanians and we chilled with them so we made it fun ourselves.

	We have some connections to AZOV-ians and we slept in their cossack house which is right at the maidan. I have some personal friendships with some of the dudes there so we visited their training camps / barracks and one of the ruskies took us for a walk around Kiev. Then again those dudes are busy so we did what we did mostly ourselves. Then again we stayed for 3-4 days so it was like a vacation for us.Â

	Not directly. Just personal contacts with random people there. I, personally, dont give a damn about photos. I am not a concert guy so I am not into moshpits and stuff - i like travelling, touring around the city, having good time with other nazis in the pubs etc. But Goatmoon and Absurd is something i can't possibly miss.
