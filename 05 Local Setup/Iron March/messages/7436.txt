<p>The only decade besides the 90s that was good in the previous century were the 30s. That's the one you can really be "nostalgic" about. Fascism was in its epoch, and the enemies were worthy of at least some respect (liberalism with bourgeois charm and extremely organized communist internationalism). Really interesting times and its no wonder historians like to go back to it to explore it. Decades before the 30s and afterwards were shit, there's nothing to be nostalgic about.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <em>Belle Époque </em>era (1870-1914) was shit, it was your typical liberal hypocrisy full of self-entitled rich pricks in power, and petit-bourgeois fanatic liberals who thought they're smarter than previous generation because there happened to be a lot of technological progress in their era. It was the era which gave communists a reason to run wild. World War I (an extremely tragic event) didn't come out of nothing, it was time for liberals to eat their own shit. It was amazing achievement by fascism to break that mentality and break the liberal vs socialist bipolarity, while challenging the retarded ancien regime nostalgia as well. Fuck both the snobism of self-declared liberal elite and untermensch behaviour of proletarians.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>50s were basically the seed of degeneration, the worst time to be a fascist too. The only ones who idealize those times are Americans because they never knew any better - they didn't have anything worthy to support in the 30s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let's not even go back to feudal times that traditionalists like to promote. While those times had some solid values as foundation of society, a lot of things weren't that good and were meant to be changed. As I always said, it's easy to idealize feudal aristocracy because you don't have to live under their rule. Imagine some spoilt rich cunt having almost complete control over people's lives. Fascism is the only ideology which accepted the good side of liberal revolution and rejected the degeneration and materialistic intellectualist  mantras. These traditionalists probably played too many video games and imagine themselves being in charge when they speak about feudal times, thinking they're something special. Same goes for neo-pagan nostalgics who'd like to "live with the nature". Studying history I'm very happy that I live where I am, in the 21st century, that's all I'm going to say.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slavic NS music (RAC) is really cool, it's what we listen here. I like how these Slavic songs are agressive but don't go over the top with it like metalheads do. They send a clear and simple message out. I especially like Slovak and Serbian RAC. Some Slavic languages sound a bit infantile to me, like Czech language for example, while Serbian sounds cool and tough. Croats have faggot accent. From American RAC I only like Day of the Sword, I'd like Final War if it wasn't for their faggot Californian accent, they sound like some stupid boy band.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The good thing about Serbian NS bands is that they actually lived through the 90s and all the shit that was going on, they fought in wars and had to endure tough sanctions and NATO bombings. We have contacts with these bands, some of them are mean as fuck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's interviews with some of them from that Slovenian site I posted before</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I agree with you about music, music should reflect our style and ideas. It doesn't actually have to be RAC/NS stuff, we have to adopt cool stuff from non-political bands.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have a bit more time now and I'll translate some cool Serbian tracks that are liked by NS. Serbs always had great music, in every genre.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anti-Jew track, simple lyrics but really strong message:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>International Jewry</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The war of '99 is Jewish war against Serbia</p>
<p>They didn't want a revival of a nation</p>
<p>Serbia woke up and showed the way for Europe</p>
<p>And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia" rel="external nofollow">the bombs</a> were bloody revenge of the Jews</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chorus:</p>
<p>International Jewry is the root of all evil</p>
<p>Serbia chokes under zionist occupation</p>
<p>International Jewry is the root of all evil</p>
<p>Their mask is multiracial democracy</p>
<p>International Jewry is the root of all evil</p>
<p>Government of 6-pointed star since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overthrow_of_Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87" rel="external nofollow">5th of october</a></p>
<p>International Jewry is the root of all evil</p>
<p>Talmudic plan is enslaved Serbia</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5th of october is symbol of Jewish victory</p>
<p>The beginning of terror of Zionist occupation</p>
<p>They present traitors as the idols of the nation</p>
<p>Over night, heroes become criminals</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Take a look at the consequences of Judeo-democracy</p>
<p>Serb is a victim of Jewish conspiracy</p>
<p>Be honourable and don't believe in deceptions</p>
<p>Fight for survival of Serbian nation until the end</p>

<p>Another cool agressive track, this one is dedicated to lone warriors, I always said how this song basically describes Breivik <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> :</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Battle Flag- White Wolf</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hiding deep in the forrest</p>
<p>He lives alone</p>
<p>His bloodthirsty look</p>
<p>Waiting for judgement day</p>
<p>For him life is a battle</p>
<p>For him battle is salvation</p>
<p>He finally arises from the dark</p>
<p>And starts to attack...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chorus:</p>
<p>Hear the howling in the forrest</p>
<p>He knows that he is no longer alone</p>
<p>Because with him marches SERBIAN DIVISION BLOOD &amp; HONOUR</p>
<p>Following the path of White Wolf</p>
<p>Warriors move forward</p>
<p>Everyone with right hand raised</p>
<p>Demanding salvation of mother Serbia</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With his claws he tears down</p>
<p>The Jewish empire of evil</p>
<p>With his cries he removes</p>
<p>The traitors from their thrones</p>
<p>The years of shameful living</p>
<p>Finally came to an end</p>
<p>With White army behind him</p>
<p>He'll bring back the glory to Serbian flag</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chorus</p>

<p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Interview with Brannik: <a href="http://hailthenewdawn.blogspot.com/2013/01/brannik-interview.html" rel="external nofollow">http://hailthenewdawn.blogspot.com/2013/01/brannik-interview.html</a></p><p> </p><p>I'm really optimistic about nationalist/NS scene in Eastern Europe, we were really lucky that we escaped all the shit that Western Europe went through in the 1945-1990 era. Well my country is a bit fucked and too pro-commie because of specific situation, but Eastern Europe proper is cool as fuck. NS/fascism/revolutionary nationalism embodies all the revolutionary spirit of both left and right, there's nothing else that's against system and people realize it. The problem with most fascists from USA and Western Europe is because they're simply faggots (raised by the parents who went through the faggot era of welfare state liberal-socialist utopia) and never had the balls to go out of their comfortable environment and have fun, be adventurers. Here we don't have much to lose and people are used to living poor and modest lives. In Western Europe you get a feeling that fascists simply want to continue the utopia, only without immigrants and liberal degeneration.</p><p> </p><p>Most of American guys here on this forum and on the internet in general are like this. They're not part of anything and probably never had contact with the street and street guys. Here the scene was forced to be a bit marginalized and you meet all kind of untermensch and criminal types, but it's ultimately a positive experience because you get the street smarts and understand how these people think and act. American internet fascists would look totally out of place in some tough old school blue collar neighbourhood or some eastern european commie pannel house district full of homo sovieticus types and criminals. Not to mention in prison. Instead of trying to control things on the streets they whine about "degeneration" of "the movement". Our scene is always going to be in the grey area between the law and the criminal world. I was always fascinated a bit by the Balkanic organized crime (and by Italian crime obviously) which is strong here in my country too and I know a lot of people from that life. I like it how wearing tracksuits like Serbian gangsters have become popular among NS youth, it makes us look tough and mean. When people see a group of 20 Slavs wearing adidas/nike tracksuits, they know they better don't fuck with them. Who gives a shit about looking respectable to some baby boomers and middle class faggots.</p><p> </p><p>Here's a cool Serbian cult song dedicated to criminals in prison (it was made in the 90s when an entire generation of youngsters ended up doing hard time), which was adopted by NS "POWs" too. I always felt closely related to it even though I was never in prison, but some of my friends were (also because of political stuff), and it's about rejecting (/being rejected by) the system:</p><p> </p><p></p><div class="ipsSpoiler" data-ipsspoiler="">

<p> </p>
<p>Do you remember those nights in hell</p>
<p>Black sky, the morning that will come</p>
<p>Do you remember those hard moments</p>
<p>You always repeated your mistakes</p>
<p>Only at night you were living well</p>
<p>Only then you had everything in your loneliness</p>
<p>Crushing nights</p>
<p>Thinking: it will never end!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chorus:</p>
<p>You stand on the other side of the law</p>
<p>There's no shelter in front of you</p>
<p>Everyone retreated, everyone ran away</p>
<p>You ended up alone</p>
<p>You watch your face, you're afraid</p>
<p>They come and take from you everything</p>
<p>Because you stand on the other side of the law</p>
<p>On the other side of the law</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Restless nights, you close your eyes</p>
<p>You're lost in your loneliness</p>
<p>They're here and they chase you</p>
<p>Because they know that everything's ruined for you</p>
<p>In your cell you hate yourself</p>
<p>No one ever asked for you</p>
<p>No one knows you and no one wants you</p>
<p>They already lit candles for you</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chorus</p>

</div><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>I never really liked how WNs were all against rap just because of niggers in America. Slavic rap is cool, they took the genre to the new level and is much superior to American nigger rap, even though they invented it. I think this WN stance is because of their general anti-criminal stand. While I wouldn't like criminals in perfect society, it's just like you said once - what do you owe to this society of traitors? It's not like cool neo-fascist groups didn't have ties to certain organized crime figures and it's not like key guys from our scene don't venture into semi-legal and illegal all the time. Those "criminals are white niggers" type of WNs probably got their asses kicked by local gangstas and never had the balls to fight back. That's another thing that's good about eastern Europe and Slavs, at least we have some hardcore gangsters which gave us a reputation of being tough. Immigrants in Germany will bully German youth but they'll think twice before messing with some Russian, doesn't matter if he has criminal ties or not.</p><p> </p><p>As I said, I'm becoming more and more optimistic about Eastern European NS scene, especially after Maidan and what happened in Ukraine. Think about it, these countries will remain racially healthy even if western Europe is totally ruined, because we simply don't have anything to offer to immigrants. I recommend you to visit some of these countries if you can (don't know if your legal problems prevent you)</p>
