	Fuck monarchy in Romania. To be lead by foreign princes is the ultimate cuckold. Also, if you check our WW2 history Prince Mihai was just a stooge and his 180deg turns are very shameful.

	Romania, like all orthodox countries should be lead by a military clerical association(best of worlds imo, military might and discipline + true christian morality).

	It's true. Our politicians and government are fools and corrupt. We have no real means to stop soviet incursion (no EE country has). It's true that antagonizing Russia will result on no good. It's true if push comes to shove no western power will come to our aid (same for every EE country).

	That being said, i do not like his cowardly and defeatist attitude. This cuck journalist forgets our history. He forgets who we are and who we can become. No matter the difficulty and no matter the odds and no matter how long it takes, we will survive and we will reclaim what is ours. Our history is our testament.
