<p>&gt;debate adminship in public</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is an internet forum, not a movement, we all debate everything openly because how else will the newbs learn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And your question is in fact irrelevant because economics are secondary in Fascism, you cannot screen if someone's a real fascist by economics, that's just betraying the fact that you yourself don't understand fascism fully or rely on liberal perception of fascism and its libcollege criteria for any definition of fascism. If you're deploying it as a trick question it is wobbly at best because, again, different fascists used different economic plans that suited the time and place they dealt with so there is a variety of acceptable answers and thus its not really a screening question.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with jackboots or swastika tattoos.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And our screening process is long since established and polished to a T. Everything from what the oldest members on here ask new users about to the forum banner are part of the screening process, you're not really adding anything to it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for fucktards, have a look around the showers to see exactly how well our process works, we dump all the fucktards there.</p>
