<p>I know about them but there's basically no way to get in touch. No one is answering my emails, it's very frustrating. I'm guessing they're scared of reds and antifas or something, such cowards. I was especially embarassed when some group here invited jared taylor to do a speech, posted the video online and fucking BLURRED their faces in the video! For a jared taylor video! Ridiculous.</p>

<p>A few years back the whole local antifa scene collapsed completely, because they started making a list of fascists, and then some fascists decided to do a list of antifas. When the antifas saw that, they closed down their website and quit activism... ridiculous, but hilarious.</p>

<p>But no, I can't get in touch with anyone else, ergo why I have to start my own group. Anyway, I have no use for "fascists" who are afraid of being "found out". I'm not going to wear a 14/88 gas the kikes shirt, but for god's sake I'll never blur my face in my own fucking video!</p>
