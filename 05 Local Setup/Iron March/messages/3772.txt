<p>I do the same thing from time to time. Well what you describe sounds like any major city in any state or country, from what I have seen anyways. It is sad.</p>
<p>Northern Wisconsin is okay. It's not bad, just hard to get around since I don't have a car anymore, and it's pretty much all forest up here. The political scene, actually a lot of my friends are accepting of my views. A lot of times at friends' houses people (I don't know) sit around and talk about racial multi-cultural issues... I have never brought up actual National Socialism to them but it seems like it would appeal to some of them. I know some of my close friends from high school actually share the same/similar political views as me, actually. One of my buddies moved back to this area and we hung out and talked about it. It's nice, but in terms of activism, I end up doing that by myself. In other words, it seems people either don't mind it or accept it, at least among my circles. But you brought up what I see an issue, usually people romanticize the whole thing when they imagine themselves being a leader of a group, having power is really what appeals to them. Personally, I think that's a bit of a problem among NS.</p>
