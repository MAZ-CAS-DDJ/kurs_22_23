<p>I know, really big shame things went how they did and I have always been grateful. I havn't been able to really speak with anyone and national action has made me keep a lower profile. Didn't think it was fair to contact you when you have been having such a tough time and I havn't been in any position to learn anything about it. I think there is still a lot more I can learn from you. </p>

<p>I would be careful how you contact me. I am not sure yet whether they are targeting NA as a whole but you would do well to remain unassociated in any fashion until you got here as they may place restrictions on your travel and affect the kind of help I can give you (if you don't want to get monitered). May also want to check how outstanding charges affect your travel to anywhere. should be ok but we will need to set up a secure line of communication.</p>

<p>I kept in contact with Emmy and she has been pretty worried. this is the longest you have been online, are things better with you now? because they have sounded very grim.</p>

<p>If you are coming here I recommend you have a plan - if people here like myself could help you that would be great. I am guessing your plan is to be in the biz. You would be good then.</p>
