	Yeah I'm in my second year as well, I think I'm only a couple days older than you alongside that. What sort of stuff do they get up to? I know the groups do stickering and postering and some street activism, but I can't imagine the latter in London. What sort of stuff goes on at the Annual convention and the meetups?
