	That's some risky shit you just put there. I put a up a fucking pony meme and i get called a zoophile or some shit when other members have posted pony porn. The fact you pulled this shit off without much backlash is pretty boggling regardless of having such a thing designated in cancer or whatever the fuck. I guess if we associate it with antifa or some other red faggot organization we can make an entire page of literal horse porn. Ironmarch is going to have to decide what can't be tolerated and shit if cancer doesn't become the 1# section of the forums. Â Tell me why you did it/
