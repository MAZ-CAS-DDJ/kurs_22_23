<p>Yeah, that's good, I feel like people think that. In the summer they have this program and they send some NYC kids up here to get away from the city and whatnot. In theory it's not a bad idea but it's usually non-whites who have no upbringing and just cause trouble the whole time. It amazes me the standards for the program though. In my old house, we had these drug addict, just overall scummy neighbors, and they were trusted with not only their own children, but these kids as well. Why, I will never know.</p>
