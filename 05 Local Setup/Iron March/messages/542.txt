<p>The ideology known as National Integralism or Thirdism is a uniquely British concept and is not inspired by Catholic Integralism or from Pl√≠nio Salgados Brazilian Integralism; the ideology does not hold the extreme separatist racial views found within some forms of ethno-Integralism or other ethno-nationalist groups. Thirdism is however extremely nationalist, meritocratic and technocratic in nature and is considered populist by its supporters. The name Integralism was adopted because it is all encompassing, and complete. However the ideologies actual name is Thirdism but is seldom used.</p>
