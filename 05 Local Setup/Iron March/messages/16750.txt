	If I was able to I would gladly join the organization, but there are three problems.
</p>

<p>
	1. Because of my young age and strict parents I am dependent on basically everything.
</p>

<p>
	2. I have a very busy schedule. Some weeks I get home at 6-7pm because the Air Rifle Team I'm on has almost 5 hour long practices when preparing for competitions. And I can't do anything during the weekend either because I work Saturday and Sunday.
</p>

<p>
	3. I am still fairly new to Fascism. So far I have only grasped the main idea and foundations that Fascism is set on, I want to grasp and understand the entire worldview and mission of Fascism until I give loyalty to the cause.
</p>

<p>
	All these problems I predict to be gone in the not too distant future, I already have plans to purchase a car and getting my permit next year so that would fix my issues with dependability. I expect my schedule to be shorter next year as well and I am positive I will understand what I seek to understand from Fascism. Atomwaffen is definitely an organization I would be part of but I believe the only real possibility of me joining is if I join during late 2017 or early 2018.
