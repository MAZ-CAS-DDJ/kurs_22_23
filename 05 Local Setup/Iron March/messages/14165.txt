	Albertans have even been showing up here for work, can't believe it's that bad the province over. I'd say we BC'ers are quite blessed when it comes to nature, it's just too bad more people don't take advantage of it and realise the greatness and truth that is nature. <br /><br />
	I won't question your fanaticism nor loyalty to blood and folk, you can question mine all you want seeing as I'm a half breed, I won't take offence, I wouldn't blame you honestly. Seeing as you've been a part of previous organisations I'm looking towards the creation of a group in Vancouver, I'll be creating one in Victoria and Nanaimo, and I'm hoping that you're up to the task to running Vancouver's very own NS group.
