	I'm in Kokomo. There's only one Orthodox Church up here but it's not bad. I haven't began the catechumen process yet tho. I've been studying the Orthodox faith for the last few months and I bought myself a study bible. I'm definitely going to begin the process soon, but I've been really busy with work/kids lately.Â
