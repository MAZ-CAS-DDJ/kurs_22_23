<p>Sorry for the long delay.  I've been crazy busy of late with work and such.</p>
<p>Would I be correct in saying that we are two ethnonationalists stuck in a country hellbent on destroying ethnicity?</p>
<p>If so, do you have any ideas on what we could do to further our goals?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You would be correct.</p>
<p>As for furthering our goals, I believe it calls for a departure from what is traditionally known as "White Nationalism" as it seems that movement is nothing more than a bunch of nostalgic paleo-conservatives with an anti-semetic flavor. I believe this sort of ethno-nationalism wouldn't just benefit whites, but would benefit every ethnic group on the American continent. White nationalism is entirely too reactionary for my tastes.</p>
<p>I think we should be promoting ethnic-pride though, definitely. Europeans need a sense of identity, and it wouldn't hurt to spread the word. As many Nationalistic states in the past have shown, it is possible to love your own without being chauvinistic towards others.</p>
<p>Also lets remember that one of the key characteristics of the liberal system is that it is sin to show ethnic-pride if you are white. I believe it is worthwhile to point out.</p>
