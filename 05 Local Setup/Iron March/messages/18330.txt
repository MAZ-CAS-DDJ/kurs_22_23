	Howdy,
</p>

<p>
	That's Master Corporal Clayton Matchee. He's a half breed injun that served in the Canadian Airborne Regiment, during the 90's in his tour of Somalia he was part of a controversy where him and another member tortured and killed some Somalian nigger.Â

	My ideology quote is what he was quoted as saying during the killing. Another thing to understand about the now non-existent airborne, is that a lot of the members were apparently neo-nazis, so after that incident the government got rid of the airborne.
