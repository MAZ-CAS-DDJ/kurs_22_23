	Ha ha, well if you plan ahead of time what books you want to read several at a time then yeah we are the same in that regard.  Anyways, this is the version of Necronomicon that I bought <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/necronomicon-h-p-lovecraft/1101955449?ean=9780575081574" rel="external nofollow">http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/necronomicon-h-p-lovecraft/1101955449?ean=9780575081574</a> sorry it's from BN but that is pretty much what I have access since I don't want an amazon account (already have an ebay account). I am pretty sure that there are some of his other stories in the edition I ordered, which is why it has so many pages. After that I'll probably try to obtain a physical copy of something by Rene Guenon, but after Necronomicon I'll probably read <em>On War</em> by Clausewitz. My second dream is to pretty much to have my own far-right/right wing book collection. I have a good little collection so far....but its far from complete.
