	Hey Xav, I guess despite what I said earlier I think I have decided to give the old republic another chance. Unfortunately I deleted it earlier so now I'll have to wait 4 or 5 + hours again for it to install again because apparently my laptop sucks which would explain the poor graphics and lag time. Tbh I am just really doing this in order to relax and blow of steam the week before uni starts again. Then I'll only get to play it on break. Because I think I am going to take a break from reading for a while because once uni starts back up again I'll have plenty of stuff to read that I don't actually want to read so I'll probably just blow off steam every once in a while by playing the game. Let me know if you get this and what you think.
