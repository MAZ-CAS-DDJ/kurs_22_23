	I am against huge artificial assimilation, but the thing is that identity has a lot more to do with a nation then blood (think about religion, which is not the part of your blood but your identity, or why we despise the concept of White Nationalism in Europe). You mentioned the Croatian nobles - remember how "natio" meant Aristocracy in the Middle Ages for the same reasons. Hungary has also mostly lost its Asian genes, and we have assimilated dozens of different peoples to our nation throughout history, but that doesn't mean we should join to a Germanic or Slavic state. The Volkspirit of the old Hungarians is here to stay, and you can find it in everything we do, in the way we live, in our character. It cannot be removed from here even if we would be 99% Germanic. Same applies to Croats. You too aren't of pure Serbian blood if I remember correctly.

	Are you sure about that thing with the Croatian language? Could you give me a source?

	That's also not a unique thing, it was done by almost every nation after the rise of Chauvinism in the XIX. century.

	(The same happened with the aforementioned Hungarians and Germans of Banat and Bácska, just sayin'.)

	Don't be selective. Truth is universal, if you are measuring the Croats on the basis of a specific perspective you have to apply it to every other nation.
