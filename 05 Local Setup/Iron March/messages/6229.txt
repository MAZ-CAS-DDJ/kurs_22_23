<p>I'm not so much concerned about Slovenia and I don't support Slovenian nationalism for many reasons, I'm more concerned about entire Central Europe and Western Balkans. Slovenian nation died in 1945 when communist partisans butchered and imprisoned almost all decent people left, except for those who emigrated in time. Besides, all my ancestry comes from a region which is culturally and historically much more connected to Hungary and Croatia. We have no common past with Slovenians before 1919. This is my micro ethnicity: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prekmurje_Slovenes" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prekmurje_Slovenes</a></p>

<p>Most of Central European history since 1914 has been complete madness and the only decent political projects were mostly tied to the Catholic Church (or in some cases Protestantism and Orthodoxy) and traditional conservativism. We used to have an empire, but everything was ruined after WWI and WWII and what you have in Central Europe now is a bunch of mickey mouse states with no relevance whatsoever. In USA you have your problems but at least you can have some hope for your country because it's still a world superpower which will always be relevant. In a country like Slovenia even if you gain absolute power it's still worthless and sooner or later pressure from outside will break you. That's why I'd theoretically support a serious "NS" or whatever movement in USA or in other European countries because there's no alternative really. If the majority of Western World doesn't "convert" no movement will ever be successful long term in any country.</p>

<p>The problem I have with "Nordic/Germanic-style" NS is that too many people here, in Central, Southern and Eastern Europe copy it rather than build on the tradition of their own nations, and thus lose much of their own identity. You have to support some form of Catholicism/Orthodoxy here, even if it's just cultural Christianity.</p>

<p>BTW, I actually have no problems with accepting some more traditional forms of "racism" (there were some concepts of "limpieza de sangre" in Catholic Europe after all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpieza_de_sangre" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpieza_de_sangre</a> ), without going into materialistic explanations of entire history through race question. I think with immigration problems some sort of "white identity" has already developed in Western and Southern Europe, but here it's not so, because we have hardly any non-whites around, with exception of some Gypsy communities, but they're not assimilated into society and will always be outsiders.</p>
