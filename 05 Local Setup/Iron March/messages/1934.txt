<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">1.	  Our Great Southern Land has often been described as the ‘Lucky Country’. An outpost of Western Civilisation in the East,  inhabiting a difficult land, Australia has built itself up from its humble beginings as a Crown penal colony and farmer fontier society into a modern 1</span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><sup>st</sup></span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> world nation.</span></span></p>
<p>Despite our small population of a mere 23 million souls we have made our mark on Asia and on the World. We are an island of prosperity and happiness amidst a Ocean of poverty and oppression. We have served with great distinction in both World Wars and many subsequent wars. Our culture is held in high regard amongst our peers in both the West &amp; the East.</p>
<p>Indeed, some have suggested that Australia made its own luck. That our Australian Way of life enabled us to utilise the hand of cards God dealt us to make our nation rich and prestigous where others with similar blessings and curses have failed miserably.</p>
<p>This could not be more apprent nowadays in the aftermath of the economic troika that wracked the world, The ‘Housing Bubble’, the ‘Credit Crunch’ and the ‘Great Recession’. As our peers in Europe, Japan and the US deal with the catastrophe that somehow nobody saw coming, as they see their quality of life sink like a stone from unemployment and austerity measures, as their leaders begin to run out of options and stare down the barrel of another, bigger collapse, Australia it seems has manged to navigate the crisis without sustaining any appreciable damage.</p>
<p>And so with that in mind we soldier on, business as usual, confident in the knowledge that history is on our side, that the Australian Way will come through for us when the next disaster inevitably strikes.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">2.	  But all is not well in the Lucky Country. Though we live in decent standards now, that which has heavily damaged and even threatens to destroy the great powers of Europe and the US hassown its’ seeds here, and the first signs of their sprouting have already begun to show.</span></span></p>
<p>This may seem unbelievable when Australia is enjoying such heady boomtimes, more-so when one remembers our proven track record. But know this: the great powers of the West  were enjoying exactly the same good times when out of nowhere disaster struck. The disaster didn’t come out of nowhere, it had been there for years and was obvious to anyone who knew how to look for it, just waiting to explode. Their complacency and their hubris to the matter meant that they chose not to heed the warnings. They had the time and the resources to do something and they did nothing. The damning situation they now face is the direct product of that choice.</p>
<p>Now Australia in an almost identical situation. Though all is certainly well and good at the top and forefront, Social, Political and Economic decay are eating away at our foundations, and soon it will reach a critical point when all that props up our country give out, all the top tier splendors come crashing down with zero notice exactly, as it did overseas.</p>
<p>And like our Western peers, we have everything at our disposal to halt and reverse this fate. We are a 1<sup>st</sup> world nation. We are the leaders of education, development, resources and technology in South-East Asia and are ranked almost as highly on the global scene. We have a vast wealth of mineral and agricultrual resources, advanced technological capbilities. We have hardy, smart and creative people in our workforce to call upon. We have a proven historical model to work with and a plethora of lessons learnt from our world experiences to redevelop this model for the modern Australia.</p>
<p>Most importantly of all, we have time and opportunity to make the most of these assets while the situation is calm.</p>
<p>We dodged the bullet the first time, but we cannot keep it up forever. All signs indicate that the crisis we saw last decade have not had their root causes dealt with, and the bandaid solutions applied to it will soon give way to the much fear but never talked about bigger and badder crisis. For Australia, the crippling problems are there and they are very real, but they are hidden from our sight by a rickety façade of proseperity. If trends persist, Australia’s economic and cultural demise is inevitable, be it by a big bang or a quiet whimper.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">3.	  What exactly IS wrong with Australia? All of our problems can fall into 3 basic categories. Social, Political and Economical.</span></span></p>
<p>What all 3 of these areas have in common is the bastardisation of sets establish systems that helped to make Australia what it is today, systems that have historically proven themselves in both civilisation and human nature. The cause of this woeful trend is the decades long to-ing and fro-ing succession of leftist liberalism and right-wing neoconservatism, initiated in the Victorian Era and taking dominance in the post WW2 era.</p>
<p>What began with Liberalised International Capitalism and Transnational Class Warfare Communism in the Industrial revolution, grew and metamorphised into the Globalised Free-Trade and Multicultrual Egalitarianism we have today.</p>
<p>Much of the old plagues from the early days have survived into the present, in company with new mutations of the original disease.</p>
<p>On the Right, we have exploitation and alienation of workers, the worship of greed and money, plutocracy and international usuary.</p>
<p>On the Left, we have cultural marxism, armchair intellectualism, a rampant sense of self-entitlement and petty class war.</p>
<p>On both sides, we have the erasure of our national identity and soverignty, the collapse of our social structure, a corrupt an ineffectual political machine  and a disgusting steak of unjustified and uncriticised self-gratification.</p>
<p>Hard work in a hard land, a clear and comprehensive set of moral values, social market economics and a strong sense of national identity and pride is what made Australia a proud Western nation. It was the destruction of these values that have been the cause of our current state of mediocrity, and it is the encroachmeant of their antithesies that threaten to destroy us now, of laziness in a world self-entitlements, pervasive social indecency and moral relativism, bungling socialist class warfare and unfettered hyper-capitalism, legally-enforced mutliculturalism and a deadening sense of nationalism and patriotism.</p>
<p>Add into this witches-brew our incompetent and visionless political leadership, our servile bondage to foreign powers for military protection, our shackling to international banks via our national debt and our mis-shapen services/mining economy, it is no wonder that the social, political and economic foundations of our society are crumbling before our very eyes.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">4.	  Take a long, hard, sobering look around you. Look at the world. Look at your country. Look at your community. Look at your family. And then, look at yourself. Look at how the poor, the rich, the weak, the powerful, the left and the right in all these spheres, and ask yourself if you like how you and other handle yourselves, and where the future seems to be heading.</span></span></p>
<p>Do you like noticing how the rich &amp; powerful continue to grow their onbsene wealth and influence at the epxense of ordinary people and plunge the fate of whole communities and nations into peril to suit themselves?</p>
<p>Are you pleased to know that the leaders of nations across the globe are so limp-wristed, are becoming indistinguishable from their opponents, have no spine and are always in bondage to those who fund their election campaigns?</p>
<p>Have you enjoyed watching deadbeats and deviants become not only less in check but more arrogant, not asking for but demanding acceptance and can now denounce their opponents as ‘whatever-phobes’. And have you enjoyed watching decent character traits such as honour, love, selflessness and vigour for life become not only very rare but incresely mocked while hedonism, selfishness, shamelessness and myopia become commonplace and openly celebrated?</p>
<p>Are you contented knowing that this is what you are now part of? What your family and friends are aprt of? Of what our children will become part of?Are you at peace knowing that they will certainly have it much worse than we are now?</p>
<p>We are doomed to that unless unless we take heart and act to impose a drastic turn-around! But  why is this so difficult?  Why are the people so complacent and so ignorant? Because they are pacified by easy living and material abundence, a scenario common to dying civilisations throughout world history; indeed it usually only when those luxuries evaporate do people emerge from their doped up state and see the truth.</p>
<p>Most of the time it is too late to fight back, but then, as now, there are those who are well ahead of the curve, who see the danger and try to rouse the others, and sometimes… they succeed, and their legacy shapes a nation for generations to come. THIS is what seperates the shepards from the sheep.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">5.	  This party is a shepard of the people and of the nation, and it has pledged its existence to saving Australia from destruction and rebuild this great southern land into a stronger country, to become a formidable player in the global community and to rise up and become the be a thing of envy of the East and West.</span></span></p>
<p>This party will cast away the old, impotent political machine and the blood-sucking insects who run it, and shall bring true leadership and competent governance to redesign from the Australian Nation-State from the ground up.</p>
<p>This party will build a new economy to bring new prosperity for all Australians and positioned to make it a force to be reckoned with in the globalised world.</p>
<p>This party will halt &amp; reverse the degeneration of our social and moral standards and will engineer a new nobility of Australian culture and spirit.</p>
<p>This party will be the death of the old system and father the New Australia.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">1.	  The Australian Integralist Party belives that in order to avoid devolving to a 2</span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><sup>nd</sup></span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">  and then 3</span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><sup>rd</sup></span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> world country, Australia must reinvent itself and secure its position as the dominant regional power and can achieve this by adopting a set of economic, social and political systems, based upon the integralist model, that exist to benefit and serve the Nation and all its people before all others.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">2.	  We believe in Corporatism.</span></span></p>
<p>Representative parliamentary democracy has failed Australia and its citizens to deliver competent leaders and to reflect the united will of the people, and has proven itsel to be little more than monied up populism and endless bickering.</p>
<p>In order for the National Will to be heard and done, the people must be actively involved in political decision making process on a daily basis and the executive powers of national leadership streamlined so that Australia’s leaders can take action without dithering but with full transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>Citizens must speak and vote based upon their profession, not their location.</p>
<p>The social classes must be recognised and embraced so that mutual co-opertaion between them can be cultivated, as opposed to exploitation or class warfare.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">3.	  We believe in Social Morality.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We believe in the National Ideal and the New Australia</span></span></p>
