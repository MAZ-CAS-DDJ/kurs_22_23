	Okay, so I come bearing news of the status of the northeast right now. As it stands, ReactionUSA wants to absorb the former Atomwaffen members, and I have another kid from the Boston area who is willing to join whatever springs up. <br /><br />
	I have reservations about joining Reaction because they are almost all in California, and I think their name sucks. I really prefer trying to start something new in the east with The Silver Legion. But I'm willing to do whatever you think would be best. If you think you're going to join Reaction, I will too. And we will be three strong either way, so it's actually progress from Atomwaffen.
