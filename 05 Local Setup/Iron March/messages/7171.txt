<p><em><span style="font-size:100%;">...One of these artificial means to reach an exaltation or inebriation was probably thought to be a means of arriving at an effective ecstasy. The same can be said of that which, in more disconcerting jargon in some alchemical texts, goes by the name of urina vini, meaning 'urine of a drunken man'. 'Urine' is explained by the root UR, which in Chaldean designated fire (Latin, urere, 'to burn') and with the anagram UR inferioris naturae ('Fire of the lower nature'), which is precisely the humid Fire agent in these methods.</span></em>..</p>
