<p>No need to be sorry for a rant! The kind of man my mother would see meme end up with, I shudder to think of... I am a Catholic, I do not believe in birth control, I want many many children. This terrifies her, it is the one thing she incessantly hounds me about. My brother was a very violent person, he has autism, so she thinks I should have maybe one or two kids. She wants me to end up with some doormat feminist type, never! No man knows the value of women better than a fascist. My mother is against how I see myself as a caretaker. I took care of my father by myself for the better part of a year, I take care of children now, in all my relationships this is how it is. She hates this, this core part of who I am that I would not be the same without... We are so different, my mother and I.</p>
<p>Do not think they were attractive to me either, not at all! But I was a very shy and frightened girl, I did not know how to say FUCK OFF! Well, that has changed <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>Oh, huskies are the sweetest dogs, I love them so much. Have you ever watched the movie Iron Will?</p>
<p>I had breakfast with 2aberrant from tumblr once, and that's all I think. Pretty lonely for a fascist, but I already have three connections in Portland!</p>
