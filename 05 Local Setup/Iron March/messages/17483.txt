	Hello.
</p>

<p>
	Loss of interest happened to me. I hope you don't take that as an insult to your political aspirations. I haven't changed my views on anything, but I don't feel I'm personally up to it (as in becoming involved) at this point. I need to gain more energy in my life and moreover address the formidable barriers to becoming seriously involved in a Kurdish political movement, which stem from the fact that my ancestry is basically my only connection to the Kurds.

<p>
	Well, I sincerely apologise for disappearing. If and when I want to become involved in your activities I will let you know. But for the moment being I don't mind doing 'online' activities in the same vein as the American 'alt-right'. In any case, I will be happy to stay in touch with you from now on.
