<p>My ideology could be thought of as civic nationalism, although I loathe the term and the connotations with it. I look towards Rome for much of my inspiration of government. I feel America was based more appropriately on the Greco-Roman ideal of republicanism and not really on the liberalism that it got swept up in. If you look at the two systems (Roman and American) you see several similarities and I see America branching out and expanding its huge influence even more. I feel we  are teetering on the edge of forming a much more imperial style state than our current democratic system, much like Rome did due to similar events and circumstances. </p>
<p>I say civic nationalist as I feel citizenship to the State is more important than one's ethnic blood line. To me, citizenship is defined as being an active, willing member of the State, which has little to nothing to do with your genetic make up.</p>
