	Sorry, ironmarch was broken for me all day for some reason. What they've said has truth to it, you can't just be an intellectual in an ivory tower. In the end the best experience comes from life and not books. This is what separates worldviews like national socialism and marxism. One works and has a foundation in reality and nature, whereas the other doesn't. Having said that, books and life together is better than life without books. If you could find a good group of comrades in your area to be active for the cause with, it would do you a lot of good. Sadly, I'm not sure if that's available in your area.

	In the end it's hard to say without knowing exactly what you want to do as a career and how you want to help the cause etc, but action is better than inaction. If you are going to be an intellectual at all, it needs to be in the same way as a warrior-poet. What are you going to do in your academic life / career to better the world and advance the national socialist cause?

	Haha, no I am not mad at you. Don't take it personally if I don't respond fast. I only just got back from work so I've been getting changed and eating and all that.
