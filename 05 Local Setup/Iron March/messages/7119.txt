<p>because a half breed tried to join and whilst he was told his presence was warmly received for events etc. there was no way he'd ever be allowed to be a "Wolf" as he is mixed race. He sperged out and did a "goat path in 300" on us and tried to destroy everything</p>

<p>You'll be surprised but IronMarch is a very multicultural, tolerant place. We have all manner of non-white and mixed users, all chanting the forum slogan "gas the kikes, race war now, 14/88, boots on the ground!"</p>

<p>kek well for obvious reasons I wouldn't support that. Now if you mean just having a home base for operations that'd be a different story. One of our users had entertained a similar idea of a "White Man's Compound" sort of thing where anyone from the forum could stay and train.</p>

<p>Anyway right now as I dissect the Hermetic Tradition it occurred to me that its fundamental point, which also happens to be ours (fascist) as well, can be easily summarized in shorter form, so I am thinking that once I finish reading this I may produce an extremely short handbook on the theory behind spiritual initiation, however, to honor the original practices behind its historical documentation it wouldn't be straight forward. Could be something else of interest to you, Jack and the wolves and that I may conceive much sooner than my proper book.</p>
