<p>Regarding the bible, there's not even really a flat out ban on polygamy, there's even passages in Deuteronomy regarding marriage to two women, even Martin Luther admitted there is nothing prohibiting it (besides for bishops and priests) and he even allowed Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse to take a second wife, but it's not the ideal form or intended purpose of God who created Adam and Eve, one man and one woman in matrimony. What has took precedence in churches unfortunately is traditions of men, this is mainly in Catholicism but it also unfortunately takes place in many "reform" churches too. Keep in mind though, anything not done in faith can be regarded as sin. As far as I'm concerned in this age one woman is a big enough ball ache. Polygamy has only been historically common place in times of low population numbers. I'd see no problems with an average Joe Christian having Eve, Eva and Evelyn as wives, so long as no sin takes place and the family roles are still fulfilled and upheld.</p>
<p>Here's an unrelated bible passage I think you'd like too</p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2024:5&amp;version=GNV" rel="external nofollow">http://www.biblegate...4:5&amp;version=GNV</a></p>
<p>It really stresses the importance of relationship and family building. A lot of people have forget the wisdom of the bible and the ways. A rough measure of Godlessness is low church attendance, low levels of successful missionary work and the banning of school prayer. I'd noticed as soon as school prayer was banned all of the bad influences came in. You can't throw God out and expect everything to be okay. I don't know how true this is either but I heard that soldiers displaying their Christian faith was being considered to be a court martial offence, but muslim soldiers displaying their faith is encouraged and accommodated and encouraged.</p>
