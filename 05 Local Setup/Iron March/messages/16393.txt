	I was referring to the honesty with which you are attacking Chauvinism (even if our terminology differs); this belief what ignores our responsibility and always accusing others for our downfall. This is similar to what I want to articulate, that we have to be somewhat Misanthropic, not only because of the current situation of mankind but because human itself is a transitional form towards God and thus it always has to be refused in order to be transcended.
