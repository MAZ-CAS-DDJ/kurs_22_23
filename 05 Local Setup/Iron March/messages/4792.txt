<p>To be perfectly honest, while I would love to see a dissolution of the Union, I do think that America has a unique European culture (although this has all but disappeared everywhere except for the American South), and it would be a shame if that were to disappear entirely. I abhor our current government, and the entire basis of that government; I despise the Cultural Marxism that has perverted our society's values, wrecked our education system, and just about destroyed that unique European culture that I mentioned; and I absolutely detest the United States as an institution in and of itself. It has been ruined by a century of the worst possible treatment that could possibly be levied upon a society, but I believe that it is up to Americans to forge an American nation. I just don't know how, and I certainly don't think that "white nationalism" is the answer.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it's worth keeping in mind that I've lived my whole life in South Florida, which is much worse than any other part of the country, in my humble opinion. White skin practically implies a desire to be black, and the line is pretty blurred between white and non-white anyway. My perspective of America in general may therefore be flawed.</p>
