	The article you linked made me think... I mean, before I was sure that I would fought against Yugoslavia next to the Croat comrades, but they didn't became independent, only got a new master to serve. And even if I am not a Croat and I never had the chance to experience how life was in Yugo, I have a strong belief that it was much better than anything the West can offer. That's basically the same as the old dilemma of the Socialist Bloc.
