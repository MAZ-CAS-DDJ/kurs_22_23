	hi<br /><br />
	yeah, slavros liked him because neiz was edgy and kewl and wore a BLACK MASK and basically tried as hard as he could to emulate slavros<br /><br />
	he ran away to bulgaria to get away from the australian feds after buying radium online without a VPN lol<br /><br />
	remember when he hinted that he was gonna do some terrorist act, but acted all coy about it? yeah, that was him playing it up<br /><br />
	in reality he was just building a small reactor to irradiate things in his home and laugh at them<br /><br />
	he irradiated a chair, laughed at it, and that was it<br /><br />
	but then he left bulgaria and went to serbia and wanted to get citizenship there<br /><br />
	marrying a serb citizen helps, so he tried to marry some turk druggie who would do anything for money<br /><br />
	but this girl ended up being his girlfriend, he fucked her a bunch while chokingÂ her, did/sold drugs with her and really liked her<br /><br />
	he got gassed because he told the slavs about all of this and bragged about it, and when they brought out an intervention for him and gave him a second chance to shape up, he ignored it<br /><br />
	there was some other stuff too but im not allowed to say, what im telling you is just what everyone in the discord was told
