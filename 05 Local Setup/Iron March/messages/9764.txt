<p>It's a permaculture group, pretty ebin.</p>
<p>I do three days typically, monday - push, wednesday - pull, friday - legs. So today was pull and I did rows, lateral pulldowns, shrugs, preacher curls, hammer curls, regular barbell curls, and some detail work for my forearms. Increased weight by five or ten pounds from last week on everything. I swear I will no longer be the skinny bastard of my younger days! </p>
