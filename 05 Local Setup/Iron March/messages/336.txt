<p>The problem is that overtly Fascist groups, even the lighter forms of it, do not do well. The Communists are tolerated mostly in part to their perceived pacificity (if there was a war between the Soviets and Europe this would not be the case). An additional issue is that many of the socially conservative policies (extolled by several members of this forum for example) similarly do not do well and attract hostility. What I would suggest is joining one of the existing liberal (small L liberal, like the Liberal Party) groups and canvassing to what extent if any there is fascist, or at least conservative militarist leanings. You may also find sympathisers from the other end of the spectrum (as is the nature of third positionist thinking), although there you run the risk of running into Antifa or worse, leftist, free-spirit hippies. </p>
<p>Starting a thread about it would be good, but again the problem I see is that fascism is inherently going to draw hostility, and any suggestion of deviation from 60 yr old outdated manifestos on this forum seems to draw cries of a liberal conspiracy. Actual political pragmatism or even intelligence seems almost non-existent. (although perhaps the departure of WTP will help this).</p>
