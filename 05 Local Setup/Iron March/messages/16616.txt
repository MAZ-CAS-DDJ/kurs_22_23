	All good mate, exactly the same here.

	Yeah, we're inspired heavily by National Action. How could you not? Haha.

	We've got a chapter only in Melb. We've got interest in 4 other states though which is good. We have a discord group where we shitpost if you wanted to join that just let me know. I'm planning to send all of us lads that can down to Tassie next year for a trip in the winter - hopefully go camping and I really want to see the southern lights. We could meet up with all you Tassie folk then and if you impress us enough you'd be a candidate for the Tassie chapter leader once we've got the numbers.

	Website is WIP. It's basically finished so it'll be a short while until it's up on the net and we'll put a link in our IM thread.
