	Codreanu disapproves. Modern (Liberal, Constitutional) Monarchies suck, that's right, but Monarchy in itself is the most common (some say the only) Traditional form of the state. It's strange how the Orthodoxes are almost always against Autocracy and 'foreign' rule. Is that because of your rejection of the Papacy?

	It is true though that Mihai was a coward, and also most of the Monarchs became mere puppets in the XX. century next to the Fascist leaders / Autocratic regents like Mussolini, Franco, Horthy, Antonescu etc., but I think that's only an argument against dynastic families, not against Monarchy, for in a sense these leaders became the true Monarchs replacing the legitimate ones. It was just a new kind of legitimacy, a more Meritocratic one.

	For the reply, yes; for the dangers you have to face, no. Believe it or not, I am still not an enemy of Romania. I was pro-Putin until recently, and I still have some sympathy for Eurasianism, since I imagine the future of Europe as it was described in the <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/3382-woah-its-snowing-on-iron-march/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=174116" rel="">Declaration of Charlottenburg</a>, but you guys made me doubt this stance of mine towards Russia. We can see however that the West is not an option, and that despite that I am all for a strong V4+ (for the Catholics) and a new Byzantium (for the Orthodoxes), those couldn't match the global powers even combined.

	As for Romania, I am clearly against its current form, but that applies almost to every other state nowadays. You have the legacy of a triune entity, made up from<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/RomaniaHistRegions.jpg" rel="external nofollow"> Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania</a> (and even if the Tisa as a border is unhistorical for the latter, it's still better than <a href="http://kaslerarpad.hu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/vas%C3%BAtvonal.gif" rel="external nofollow">our old railways</a>), but since the 'Great Union' the only thing Romania does is to assimilating every regional identity into a 'Greater Wallachian' one and denying the existence of any other. Romania should be a unity of these regions, not a hybrid of it, just as Hungary should be a unity of today's Hungary, Transylvania, Southern Slovakia etc. - and in reality, that's the situation. Those regions and those peoples are real and there, unlike the abstract borders on our maps. It's either a recognition of this truth or a continuation of lies, backstabbing, and slaughter until our nations both go extinct.
