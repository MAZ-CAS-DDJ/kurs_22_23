	Sure thing. First thing you want to do is recruit your friends who are fascist before you recruit anyone you haven't known for awhile because you need to have the highest trust with the core members. You need to then recruit others after that, keep in mind AW didn't start in 2015, it started in 2013. Find guys with skills, give preference to those with out. Have everyone read SIEGE that is interested in joining. After you got like 10-15 people, then you start to get your name out there with stickerings and shit like that to attract more people. Make sure that people who are interested in joining are not just interested in joining just to put up stickers and shit, when people come to us with that mindset, we tell them to fuck off and join the boy scouts. You want people with the SIEGE mindset.
