	I'm located in the Cariboo region of BC. I know that there is/was a Blood &amp; Honour group in the Lower Mainland (8 hour drive), but that's all I'm aware of. I don't know if there are any music scenes or even any moderate Nationalist groups here. A quick google search doesn't bring up anything. I've been talking to a couple guys from IM who are also in BC but neither of them are closer than 8 hours. Most everything is located on the other side of the country, in Ontario.
