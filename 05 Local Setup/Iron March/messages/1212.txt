<p>I wanted to run this by someone to see if it would be a problem. I ran an exclusively NS site. However a lot of reasons hindered this, and the site is gone.</p>
<p>Would it be okay if this site redirected to IronMarch for the remainder of my hosting plan (I think only the rest of this month or July)?</p>

<p>Figured I would ask just for the sake of being courteous.</p>
