<p>I am glad to hear this and especially glad that you told me this. Currently the Atomwaffen Division is growing extremely rapidly, I am going to meet a new member today in fact. If you'd like more info on what we are you can read the thread in the IM chapter's section here:</p>

<p>I look forward to hearing more from you. I suggest you also talk with TheWeisseWolfe, he will be leading things while I am gone for my basic training in the military and you guys can possibly organize some stuff together.</p>
