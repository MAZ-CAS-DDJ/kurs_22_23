<p>yeah they really have been, its sorta in their nature. interestingly, before jehovah became the one true god he was a warrior god of the skies and thunder. like a jew thor. yeah, im not really sure either. i thought it sorta was like the myth with saturn devoring his children, it was a way to increase his own power and dimish others, but im not sure if jehovah went around eating ishtar and moloch until he was supreme ruler.thats a little hardcore even for him</p>
<p>im still developing my exact opinion of what the gods are, I guess its a bit complex. i think the gods are sort of the collective consciousness of everyone or thing that fits the archetype and main purpose of that god, a little like jungian archetypes but they have some power. i dont think any gods are fully reliable, including the christian one and including my own. even the sagas and legends portray odin as a sort of fickle god, changing his favor from one champion to another, but his reasons are understandable most of the time. thor is a much more forgiving and reliable god than most of them though, thats a large part of his archetype. i feel in some ways its more important to follow the values and rules of the gods than it is to comprehend them, but doing both is the best way.</p>
<p>yeah exactly, i would rather fight over blood than faith. I understand that. positive christianity is good from what I remember of it, ive always sorta felt that the bible was pretty aryan if you just cut out the old testament. well me and bear will be fighting then over your faith i guess haha. and yeah sometimes, last time was a few years ago though. i really like the east coast, its beautiful and european-like. nice wildlands.</p>
<p>yeah, i like all dialects of german and its a beautiful language. proto-germanic is the best though. dutch sounds a little funky....and yeah i could believe that. our cheese here doesnt seem quite right alot of the time. i used to eat processed and fast food sometimes to save money until i worked at a fast food place once...never touched the stuff again lol. its worth busting your bank or cutting corners elsewhere just to eat better. yeah, i still do the elf offerings too. i just put food or milk in little bowls and leave them outside. its funny both christmas and halloween come from pagan holidays, and even though thanksgiving is an american invention we know the germanic tribes and especially the saxons would make most of their sacrifices in november and "give thanks" to their gods. folk memory is real</p>
<p>I understand, ive been pretty busy as well. last 4 years have been a little hard on me. which book are you reading now? im currently reading agrippa and some of the old greek philosophers. I got interested in 8th grade so yeah I got in deep pretty young, explains my fanaticism lol. i picked up a kids book on norse myth, couldnt stop reading it and reread it almost once i was done, then looked for the original sources for it. after studying for a few weeks on a thursday I saw a storm come from the west and a hammer form itself in the clouds and lightning was spewing around it, and I decided to worship the gods with thor as my god-father.</p>
<p>do you have blond hair? not that red or brown is less germanic, one of the older norwegian kings was named halvdan the black because of his black hair and beard</p>
<p>or maybe we wuz kangs n shiet</p>
