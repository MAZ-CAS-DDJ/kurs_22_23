			I'm surely a real fanatic when it comes about this ! I'm even thinking about joining Groupe Union Defense soon as a IM member stated in my introduction post .

			But, I do think that we don't need violence to achieve politcal goals since we need first to make a new reputation to our cause ! Violence would only make people more hateful against us (I'll try to see where I can explain my philosophy on the forum !)

	Cool that you're trying to make a difference.<br /><br />
	As for your philosophy, people here may disagree. The general view here is that people can't be convinced with good deeds and reason with the system still in place. Everything is rigged against us, so it may prove useless to be anything other than purely militant.<br /><br />
	However, every country's situation is different. In Western and Northern Europe (as well as in America), it seems that the people are lost and cannot be retrieved through any other means except through a brutal awakening.<br /><br />
	But in Eastern and Southern European countries, for instance, people are still generally socially conservative. This makes it possible for more civic movements to rise, such as Golden Dawn and Casa Pound.<br /><br />
	One is a political party which helps communities through charity and security against violent migrants, the other is a counter-culture among the youth which hopes to be a political party one day.<br /><br />
	These groups work for their respective homes, but could you imagine such movements in America? Or Britain? They'd get shut down not just by the government (which is expected), but also by their own people.<br /><br />
	I would recommend reading some threads such as the American Futurism Workshop (<a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/3805-american-futurism-workshop/#comment-82247" rel="">http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/topic/3805-american-futurism-workshop/#comment-82247</a>) to get what exactly I mean. Unique circumstances and all that.

			Yeah, I'm starting to really like IronMarch, more deep I'm looking in the forum, more surprised I am , as "Hammer of the patriot" wich looks like a real treasure.

			I like this "smart brain" way of thinking going on in this forum, I'll probably stay for long !

	You should check out the antimony archive. It includes IM original writings as well as books written by fascist figures throughout history.<br /><br /><a href="http://laraj.ca/AGwiki/" rel="external nofollow">http://laraj.ca/AGwiki/</a><br /><br />

	Aww, how kind of you!
</p>

<p>
	Honestly, I've taken a bit of a shine to you~<br />
	And yes, if you were to take a picture of SS bolts shaved into your head, people would certainly like that. Would give you a bit of rep, as well!
