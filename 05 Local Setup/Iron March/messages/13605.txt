	I like Reaction, but I don't no that much about you. Are you NS? Or just general nationalist? What have you done so far? What are your aims? <br /><br />
	On a more shallow note, I really prefer the aesthetic style of what I've been doing for Silver Legion over what I designed for Atomwaffen (I designed the propaganda for BU stickering, and while I think it turned out well, I'm more interested in futurist aesthetics and movements). <br /><br />
	Overall, I am not opposed to joining up. But it really depends on what you're about.
