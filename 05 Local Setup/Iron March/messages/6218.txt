<p>Haha.. I know exaclty what you mean. I also lived in Amsterdam, in the Bijlmer to be exact, small Africa. If I could I would give you contacts to get another place in Amsterdam to stay, but I don't have any. Thats the reason that I myself have lived two-three years in the fucking Bijlmer. I got aggresive from all those niggers there. When it was dark I had to be home, because you cannot see niggers in the dark, so you don't know when you get attacked hahaha. In Holland there was a short period that you had a law that niggers had to wear a yellow vest by night, so that people could see them <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" />. In that time I watch to russian neo-nazi beheading video over and over again... to calm down I suppose.</p>

<p>I mentioned you yesterday evening. Those people are willing to meet you. Around 6 february, we will go a week to budapest, because of "day of honour". It's I think about 100 euros or 200, for staying and travelling. It is very soon, but if you want you can come with us. I have to say it is not the most intellectual week, but more about fun and meeting other comrades we know from Scotland, England and Hungary. And ofcourse pay our respects for the heroes of the Waffen-SS.</p>

<p>I get your point about networking and I am thinking the same way about that. So If I have the time in the next months, you have the time and want to see something more then Amsterdam. I will show you around through Holland, Flenders and Germany. And ofcourse introduce you to people with our views. Haha you can teach me also about Russian history. </p>

<p>If you want to meet after 21ste january let me know what will be a good day for you, and what you want to do? I do not know if there is a event of our people in that week, I will look for it. Or do you want to grap some coffee, or something like that?</p>
