	We work with various pantheons but all European.  Mostly Norse, Celtic, Finnish Paganism.  But we also use the ONA dark gods and work with Draugr, Slaugh, Dearg dull and other nature and anscestral entities.  Also the Fayen tradition seeing Hitler as a sort of deified essence.  Recently I have been getting into the Vrill society and more into Thule.
