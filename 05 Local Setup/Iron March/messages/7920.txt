<p>You are right but about new language, that would be problematic, because our languages are different. Surely both of us don't understand Hungarian for example. However, somekind of common-language when we talk with each others would be nice and much better choice than english, or russian what some Turkic and also Finnic people use when they discuss with each others.<br /><br />Yes, those are mere dreams for now. However, Idel-Ural is interesting place because it is Turkic and Finnic.<br /><br />Yes, we should work mostly in our near-areas now. However, Finland has always been big brother for Estonia but the fact is that nowadays Estonia is in much better condition. Unfortunately situation in "Russia" is much much worse for those people. So Finland should help them, like you said, and naturally keep closer ties to Estonia. And in my opinion to Latvia and Lithuania too, because they will be natural allies.</p>
