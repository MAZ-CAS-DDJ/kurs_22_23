<p>Sorry I'm taking so long to reply. I was abroad for a few days.</p>
<p>At the moment I am working two fairly low pay jobs; A head waiter with a catering company (which I only work occasionally because I can choose the days I want to work on) and as a shopkeeper in a bookshop. I plan on quitting the bookshop job soon though as I expect to start University by the end of this year. </p>
<p>Hobby-wise I mostly just read, train boxing and play bass guitar. There isn't really much else <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" />. You?</p>
