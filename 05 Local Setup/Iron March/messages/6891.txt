<br /><p style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;"> </p>
<br /><div>I've never ever liked Pol Pot and never ever ever ever will. Period. He's a disgusting opportunist. All he did was cling to whomever gave him the most international prestige and/or money (like many leaders of his time, Modern Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Most of Africa, etc.)</div>

<br /><div><span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">2. Could you describe to me a bit of your opinion on economics, Specifically the monetary system itself?</span></div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>On the economics area I agree heavily with the Strassers--the national economy is burdened by the capitalists/bourgeois whom work not in the interests of any nation, or any peoples, but for their own greed and their own profit. This motivation for them to continue to produce things based solely on their greed for more money rather than advancing the nation as a collective is what has caused most of the major economic problems of our society. The 2000s' house market collapse was caused by bank's greed to give out more and more loans to profit off of while not properly reserving "rainy day money" and constantly giving themselves billions of dollars in bonuses alltogether--rather than working in the interest of the nation, which would require a more hesitant approach to this situation and not burdening the working class with loans they know they will never be able to pay off--they were working for self-greed.</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>Additionally, I support the idea of the abolition of hereditary wealth, this (for the most part), instills an attitude of superiority for no other reason than luck of being born into that family. The abolition of hereditary wealth will resolve many of the problems of people who only knew about being rich and do not know about the struggles of the working class at all. Requiring all the rich to service the nation to attain their wealth will instill a correct nationalist view (not GOP nationalism either),  and will further close the gap between the rich and the poor. As society operates more efficiently when you <em>can actually rise up</em> in social class--which is virtually impossible in the capitalistic system.</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>Regarding monetary policy--I don't have much to say here other than the basic "gold standard" issue libertarians like to press. I view the "gold standard" as an outdated policy for an outdated time. The <em>gold standard</em> is not entirely efficient, as the amount of gold in the world is finite, while population, living costs, etc. are not finite and static, it is forever increasing. In order to have an efficient currency it cannot be based off of the gold standard. Even if the gold standard was institutied it wouldn't make any difference really, it's a subjective material object of only the worth we give to it (which really isn't that much tbh). There is not enough gold in the world to operate currency based on it unless you are prepared for a huge deflationary movement which would wreck economies. (Probably more elaborate than was necessary, but economics I like to somewhat consider my forte, especially economic theories <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" />). Any questions just shoot 'em back at my, or if you want to know more about my views I can rant for hours &gt;.&gt;</div>
