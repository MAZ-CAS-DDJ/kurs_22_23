<p>Hey I appreaciate it.</p>
<p>Thank you for being understanding with me.</p>
<p>Sometimes to learn that something is stupid you have to touch the proverbial stove.</p>
<p>One has to assume that in a place such as this everything is watched.</p>
<p>Nature of who we are is it not?</p>
<p>When I would like to ask about the discussion, after I read the stack of books and literature I just had recommended, I will send you a message.</p>
<p>That way hopefully stupidity can be headed off before it hits a page again.</p>
