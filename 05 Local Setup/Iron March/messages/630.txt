<p>Hi A.B.,</p>
<p>I will proofread the journals and the archive content as I read them.  Despite the german screenname and Latin greeting, I am from the South/Central USA-- Arkansas.  Like most people I'm very familiar with Word and similar programs.  However I have an interest in learning typesetting software such as Miktex which is more technical, possibly unnecessarily so.  I am only proficient in English so I won't be able to help with other languages.  I'll see what I can do with the archive content.  Anyway, I am looking forward to the potential inherent in this community!</p>
