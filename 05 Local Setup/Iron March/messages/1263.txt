<p>1. I didn't touch your post.</p>
<p>2. IronMarch is not a hugbox, it's a bush of barbed wires - you get offended - no one actually cares (it's a fascist forum, not a liberal one, no circlejerks around here), you're supposed to stand your ground, naturally some excesses are not allowed but otherwise I can only suggest that you get thicker skin.</p>
<p>3. There is nothing to resolve, you fucked up, it was made apparent, nothing else left to do but move on. If you think deleting the post is some sort of way to resolve the matter - it's not. What's done is done, move on.</p>
