<p>I'm going to ghost for some time <em>aka</em> keep an eye out for posts and read much of their 'stuff'. Honestly, I don't know what to make of IMF. I <strong>really</strong> despair ATM of English Nationalism and almost want to give up trying - the enemy wants us to be extinct and our own 'efforts' to preserve our beloved nation / country &amp; culture, results in IMF... A place of <strong>extreme</strong> hate for even other Nationalists. For fucking shame.</p>

<p>I won't be able to reply, but rest assured I support you - you're one of the good ones. I shall perhaps contact you soon (won't log in for some time 'ghost' etc.) Yet, que sera sera etc. Blah blah blah.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
