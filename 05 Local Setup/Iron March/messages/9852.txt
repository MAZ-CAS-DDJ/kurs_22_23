<p>I can understand our poor parents concern, they think we might end up dead or worse... This stupid shooting has not helped things at all with my mother, needless to say! But I am certain they will eventually see that it is a genuine love we hold and not a stage of edginess or some brain affliction. If they do not then I have little need for them, sadly.</p>
<p>That sounds like an adventure, but stay safe and keep your blades sharp. A dorm lounge sounds awfully exposed and I don't want anything to happen to you.</p>

<p>Manual labor, boy I have got lots of it recently. On friday we moved bookshelves, saturday I cut wood, sunday I dug a trench, today I carried boxes... Good feels!</p>
<p>Your dinner sounds better than mine, I made a steak but the meat wasn't the greatest, kinda chewy <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_sad.png" alt=":(" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/sad@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
