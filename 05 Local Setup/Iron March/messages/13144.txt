	The use of TOR, fake names, and these secure channels is more of security culture thing - we are not being actively monitored by say, the government (at least that is my personal opinon based on the information I have) but it encourages people to act more sensibly so they don't get themselves doxed by leftists. I don't like hearing about workplaces getting phoned up or individuals being exposed in the newspapers. Since the mirror article on my a couple of years ago practically everyone has been able to maintain a degree of anonymity. Obviously if they ever decide to raid anyone they are not going to find anything that can be used to build a case around them.

	regards to the membership and geography, the UK has an East Germany effect with the north - the north is where most demonstrations are held (all far right groups) - 2/3 our supporters are in the North West and Scotland.
