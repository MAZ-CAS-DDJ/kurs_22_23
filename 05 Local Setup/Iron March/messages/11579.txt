<p>Hey. All we share is seeing a ball in an ''astral world''. Not meeting hyperboreans or whatever. Some of the questions asked I experianced, others not. I know for a fact others on the forum have had experiances related to it before they even heard of ironmarch or Evola or whatever. If I would like to mock you I would do it openly.</p>
