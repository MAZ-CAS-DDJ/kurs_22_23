	I've not read any Serrano.  Hyperborean Shitlord has I think, he digs it.  I have read a bit of Savitri Devi and I do like what I've read of hers.  The Kali Yuga is the Indian way of observing that history is cyclical.  The Greeks had this concept as well which they called Anacyclosis.  Its the correct observation that cycles of growth and decay are natural like life and death and this cycle, this process applies as much to civilizations as it does to individual organisms.  <br /><br />
	People like Hitler are inevitable and are integral in this process.  Its a natural occurrence.  Some, like Devi, Serrano and really GLR view these people with a spiritual reverence.  In the Hindu tradition, the oldest of them, these people are called avatars of Kalki.

	Its interesting and I might be getting into it.  Honestly, Christianity never hit me, it never shook me.  The closest thing I probably feel to spirituality is hearing Hitler speak while reflecting on what he tried to do.
