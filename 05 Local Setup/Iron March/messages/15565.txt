	I hope this won't end up with more and more Poles becoming Atheists.

	Tibet is not Muslim, but mainly Buddhist, they are also good guys. Maybe you were talking about the Uygurs? They are bigger troublemakers than the Tibetans, but it's understandable since their country is under Communist occupation.

	You know, I think our main enemy is Modernity, which consumes every religion and every Tradition it can. Ask yourself the question: who has the strongest faith today? Who is ready to sacrifice himself for God in any moment? There are Christians who are able to do that, but there are a lot more Muslims. I don't say we should live together, (our ideal border would be the Mediterranean Sea and the Bosporus) but we should never support Atheism and Modernism (Satanism) over any other Tradition. Maybe we are enemies with Islam, but we are both alive. Modernity is death for both of us.
