<p>Agreed. Tims will go but I think the coffee addiction will stay, (I personaly dont drink coffee but whatever) but for the americans I have no sympathy for what happens to them. With these random acts of violence and such I have no more sympathy then I would have duting the time of the roman empire and its slave uprisings and rebellions. The Americans have chosen their fate long ago and if not active in their complacency in it is enough of a mark of guilt.</p>
<p>Other countries and people I tend to have sympathy for. Most of Asia, south America and africa have in one way or another been victemized by American Imperialism and as such could make some good friends. Like iran and its rather solidly built Authoritarian regime could make a strong ally, same goes for Syria if it survives the current civil war.</p>
