<p>Look for scholarly sources, avoid anything with "magick" or "shamanism" in the title. It is better to read from a Christian scholar who knows their shit than a Pagan author writing out of their ass. Gods and Myths of Northern Europe by Davidson is a good start.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and I also read alot about the other pagans for comparative study now, some of the holes in Germanic Paganism make more sense when examining the other versions. Early Hinduism is even worth studying, you would be surprised how similar it is to European religion, but later on it drifts further from its Aryan source. theres not much worth reading after the second veda.</p>

<p>the meditations by aurelius is roman, but its morals line up very well with fascism. he goes on rants against the gays a few times. its like roman zen</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and if youre looking strictly for germanic paganism, the heimskringla, any of the sagas, germania, or any histories of the germanic tribes (even early christian) are the main sources. land of darkness is also good but was written by a kebab.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and theres some good contemporary writers but most I would avoid.</p>
