<p>I'll see what I can do mate. I dont have skype anymore as I thought it was fucking around with my computer.</p>
<p>My work hours are weird so my only real free time is in the morning and bits of the weekend. It only really adds to my writers block that has has lasted for 3 years.</p>
<p>I'm thinking about writing book review of the Silmarillion very soon (might write down the basics tonight and take it form there).</p>
<p>I'm going to try and use the review as a springboard to do more stuff, but when I do that I could send it in if you want me to.</p>
