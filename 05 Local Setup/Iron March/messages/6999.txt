<p>Well, as you can see, they don't like to hear about how they're actually not doing a damn thing to help out whitey with their beliefs, lol.</p>

<p>Hits some of them pretty hard when you point out how Hitler was actually a Christian, and all that occultist bullshit was made-up by the French propaganda and Jews.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Speaking of, how do you feel about Jews?</p>

<p>I'm not anti-jew. But I do oppose Zionist jews who live in other nations, you should swear your loyalty to your nation, not to a foreign land. If you swear your loyalty to this foreign land (Israel) you should be deported there. Simple as that. Jews who swear loyalty tot the nation they live in are no problem.</p>

<p>I have noticed there is a large pro-pagan influences here. If any of them actually believe taht shit though, they're quite stupid &gt;.&gt;.</p>
