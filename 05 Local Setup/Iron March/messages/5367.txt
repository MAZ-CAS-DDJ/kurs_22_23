<p>US Hegemony is supported by and perpetuates division in Asia. Root causes are of course, Japanese Imperialism. There is no reason to think that reversing this situation is impossible. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My basic premise is that Asia has caught up to the west (and even surpassed it in some fields) in terms of technology but culturally I think Asians are far too dependent on the west. Through intra-Asian cooperation instead of jingoism and collaborationism it might be possible to </p>
<p>a. Increase security in East asia through balance of power</p>
<p>b. rid East Asia of American influence without destabilizing the region</p>
<p>c. Create a political situation in which it is possible for a shared (not common of course) culture to develop like it did before western influence </p>
