	Duolingo is probably decent to learn that as well, you can do it off the net or with an app. Learning German will help with your italian, trust me. Italian has gendered nouns too, although they are only masculine and feminine, no neuter like German has. Italian also uses dative case like Italian, so if you can get the hang of that, it'll help immensely with your Italian as English has no dative case. If you're going to use Duolingo however, I recommend going for the 'hard' option and getting 50 points per day. Maybe 30 if you're very low on time. The more you practice the better you'll be. Also helps more than anything to expose yourself to the language through consuming media in that language, preferably from native speakers. Unfortunately, as much as I'd love to immerse myself in German I don't know of any German media that isn't pozzed to hell these days.

	Funnily enough I was looking into Old English (German English, really) recently and that has dative case and is very very similar to German. It's interesting how all languages have been dumbed down and simplified over time.
