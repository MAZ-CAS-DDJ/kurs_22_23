<p>I agree Breivik has many problems.</p>
<p>I used to be completely opposed to him because of his methods. But I realized, who would know about his message if not for what he did? He made his ideology mainstream.</p>
<p>Could he have done that without killing? Maybe. Could he have done it better for killing someone else? Certainly. So while he is pathological and possibly insane in some ways, I do not find him to be an idiot.</p>
<p>But I consider many criticisms against him valid.</p>
<p>Perhaps I was just very moved by his manifesto.</p>
<p>Also, I like all of your views so far. And yes, people here are blind to new views of Fascism. So naturally they would be upset by any mention of Mao.</p>
<p>What do you think of Strasser?</p>
