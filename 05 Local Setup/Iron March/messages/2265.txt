<p>I would not try it....the  the Auraria campus will be a very bad experience, you wont really convince anyone there they will just gang up as liberals do and talk over you. So you could try to hit more of a conservative area. At least with conservatives bridges can be built. Theres a pice of advice from me, if you need anything else contact me.</p>
