<p>Yes, I recall how one of your tumblr pages had something on it at some point about how much politics pertain to the Centurion Method. Thing is, however, that our worldview is so fundamentally different to theirs that they inevitably do smell something fishy, its why all these attempts at appeasing the system always end up in sad displays of weakness like when Nick Griffin got on Question Time - I keep referencing that as my prime case example against moderation and what are its consequences. Ben and myself had written on the subject.</p>

<p>If you want to contact Ben and Alex (guys in charge of NA) you can just PM them here, they've been users here since before NA was founded, Ben is a co-admin with me of the forum. Alternatively you can contact them via skype, if you'd like I'll ask them for their permission to give you their contacts (<em>I imagine I'd like to speak to you more directly via skype as well on matters of both activism and fascist worldview/theory as I am deep in research for a book that I hope would serve fascists worldwide in better understanding what it is that we do, where we're coming from and what are our goals after taking political power)</em>. They are a little on edge with the aftermath of the Mirror article. In fact my immediate statement to them via skype once you joined IM was "<em>y u no ally with Centurion Method NA man?</em>"</p>

<p>Here in Russia we have since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan the phenomenon of "Military-Patriotic Clubs" which were established by Soviet war veterans who thought that recruits didn't get enough proper training in the military before being shipped out to wherever. Their main goal has always been military training and patriotic education. These clubs exist today and some are founded by nationalists which is how we get nationalists training with weapons that has been the envy of most western nationalists. I repeatedly proposed to Ben that looking into creating some alternative that would be legal in the west would be great, we talked about them in particularly at a time when I hanged out with one more or less moderate, by Russian standards, nationalist movement that had their own military patriotic club where they taught teens and even young kids with a monarchistic-patriotic orthodox overtones.</p>

<p>The Resistance movement here also focuses on fitness and hold sporting events at schools which are also their recruitment grounds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I imagine Centurion Method could do something to that extent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Personally I'd kill for a proper fascist military fitness setup and from the pictures of NA events, impressive as they are, the people who are there could stand to loose some fat and get some muscle.</p>
