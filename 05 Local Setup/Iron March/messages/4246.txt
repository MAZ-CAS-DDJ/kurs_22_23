<p>Doing great, actually.</p>
<p>Got this dockworker job in Seattle now. Great pay along with good benefits. My boss likes me, married old overweight fellow, says I remind him of his brother. Made friends with him, sweet guy with no ambition. since I'm the only worker who shows up on time and can do my job properly I should get promoted within a month or so.</p>
<p>The City is well enough, though most men I've met are skinny and lazy and most of the women loud and rude. Thankfuly I live in an are populated with asians so it's never really loud and people are polite.</p>
<p>Enough of my droning, how are you?</p>
