<p>Alright thanks for the advice. And yeah that is what I was saying all along is that the Celts are pretty close, but obviously different, from the Germanics. As for Valhalla I was primarily interested in it (and still am) because it is a "warrior's heaven" and that is were I think the SS men and Wehrmacht men ended up. Guess I thought it would be cool to hang out with them in the afterlife ha ha. But, seriously thanks for the advice. Mind if we talk again sometime? Please let me know if you get this.</p>
