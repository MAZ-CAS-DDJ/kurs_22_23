<p>Yeah I guess I will admit the myths about loki are a little strange lol. I think loki is supposed to represent the degenerative force in the universe as opposed to the generating force; the gods. He acts like a complete degenerate, he changes into a fly in some myths and plays a part in ending the world. It's a stretch to say loki created liberals but he almost represents the same type of energy and behavior. Alot of older myths kinda have weird things like that, egyptian and Greek is even stranger. I also don't think all the myths preserved are of equal value; the one where thor has to dress as a woman to sneak into giant land is obviously comical and either a later myth made to mock the god in Christian times or a tale to tell at campfires. Then you have the the myths where odin hangs himself or svipdag awakens the Valkyrie and those have very transcendental themes.<br />Sorry to rant about myths it's in my nature<br />I would agree about the Democrat voters, everyone I met who supports bernie is usually a college kid who's voting for him because legalise it 420<br />I have no clue what flamenco is, I guess I'm a pleb. I've done ice skating before but not too often. I live out innadesert currently so hiking is pretty easy for me. I like to wander and meditate.<br />Yeah I've heard lots of horror stories about britain. Makes me sad to see one of the biggest European empires stoop so low. I've had similiar situations, Asians Latinos and blacks usually agree with me before white men. They don't have as much at stake for saying so I guess. Middle and upper class whites in america are almost the picture image of cucks. Too rich and comfortable to care about their races plight, too softened to do anything about it anyways. Almost all whites of any class are mislead though, either by Israel or leftism (so indirect israel). Raising kids will be hard in this world, I probably wouldn't let them watch tv. Even video games have less filth<br /><br />I guess so, a saxon as well! If I had disposable income I would have one, trust me. An iron cross will do fine till then. I actually have a textbook on Prussian history I read in high school (wasnt assigned). Covered everything from the protoslavic prussi tribes to Bismarck and their dissolution in WWII. I think german military spirit was crippled by them dissolving prussia, that was just the allies spitting in our face after they won the fight<br />I've got a black eagle flag in my room as well</p>
