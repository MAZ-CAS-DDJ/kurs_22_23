<p>It is ok.</p>
<p>Such misunderstandings happen on the Internet. It is impersonal.</p>
<p>My father is Protestant, my mother is Jewish. Growing up, I never noticed a genetic difference between them, and I was never familiar with racialist theory. (Such things are also taboo in Germany though...).</p>
<p>My father has blond  hair and blue eyes, my mother's hair is auburn and she has blue eyes (her parents had auburn and blond hair), with a small noes. And both had the same basic values, but different religions. I never really considered the possibility that one of them was "not German" until I became familiar with the Neonazi movement--learning English opened this entire world to me.</p>
<p>So I suppose some of my rejection for this is from not understanding how that movement is pro German today. The only people who threaten Germany today are Arabic Muslims, who have neither nordic/german features, or do they value what Christians and Jews value culturally. (I see them and their terrorism against Germans, and their Sharia Law as the real problem today).</p>
<p>I will say that if you truly are German, Jew or Christian, I would lay down my life to defend you as my brother. Such is my belief in nationalism. Hopefully, in our non Internet lives, we can defend Germany together as allies of the German cause. If not, that's ok. I simply believe that antisemitism fuels the liberals of the West in their anti German resolve. And the liberals in the German government who oppress the nationalist spirit of Germany.</p>
<p>But like you, I also am opposed to the idea of Jews in Germany who believe they are their own nation within a nation (however, such Jews live in Israel now, and not Germany--although I do express nationalist solidarity for Israel). But I know better than to believe they must leave or die. I believe in conversion to the cause of nationalism.</p>
<p>If they do not like the idea, then give them a ticket to Israel. Israel needs people to sustain itself against the Arabs anyway.</p>
<p>Hopefully we can get along in the future.</p>
