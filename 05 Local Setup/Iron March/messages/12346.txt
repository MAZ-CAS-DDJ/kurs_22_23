<p>Thanks. I have actually read some of Mein Kampf before, and to be honest at the time I subscribed to a Marxist worldview so I remember being unimpressed. I'll read it again and see what I think.</p>
<p>On a side note, seeing as you liked my post renouncing homosexuality, would you.. "vouch" for me in that thread, so I don't get gassed? Don't know how much sway you'd have but I don't feel like getting banned when I'm still interested in learning.</p>
</div></blockquote>Well I'm not so sure that they are going to gas you, but even if they do it wouldn't matter much.  You must lurk more on the forums and read through the reading material they gave you.  Do a lot more reading both on this website and off(with books)  and then when you learn more you can easily make a new account here and start off a lot better.  Gassed or not you can still view the boards anyways.  People who have been gassed or given prisoner status before have gotten their act together and then came back to the boards before.  If they see that you have improved they won't automatically gas you. <p>If i see that they do plan on gassing you I will put in the good word. But either way just read more.  Maybe the Richard Tedor book I linked to above would be a good start for you since it deals with the facts of what the Nazi's actually did after getting into power, and the real reasons for the war.</p>
