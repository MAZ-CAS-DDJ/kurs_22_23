	Hehe, I really like the Triumvirate album, these bands really spiritually feel Fascist on the sound-level (although the lyrics are often anti-fascist).
</p>

<p>
	Other than that, currently have been listening to lots of Nordic &amp; Pagan inspired music, feels good to my ears &amp; roots (Burzum, Bathory, Turisas, Tyr, and recently found Arkona, although in Russian I quite like it). Eluveitie is great although softer, due to their Celtic Volkish spirit.

	Ex Deo, also great.

<p>
	Then finally you have some martial stuff like Arditii, Legionarii, and triarii, which is quite Fascist and nice.
