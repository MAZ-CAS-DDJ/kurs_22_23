Assuming you're not tugging proverbial chains, except lonely so-en-so's to message and ask you to be their mate, or something. You seem pretty fresh to most of this, and like that it may intimidate you. But just play your cards straight and don't be stupid. If you have any questions, leave me a message and I'll get back to you.</span></span>
