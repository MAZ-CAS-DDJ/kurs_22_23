<p>I was involved in the nationalist struggle since my teenage years (7years ago). I had radical patriotic sentiments as a child and that culminated in me being a full fledged teenager with solid convictions that was thirsty for action, i wanted to give something to see my ideas fulfilled. GD at that time and even now provided that. Then things started. Demonstrations, speeches, leaflet deliverances. The big turn was in 2009 when a turn to election politics started.</p>

<p>The internet, proved valuable at that time. Name it, GD was known as a fringe group pre-2009 and after the Euro-elections great interest has started to show. Many would google "golden dawn" and redirect to our main website. That was our biggest weapon. Of course facebook played a role in that, as people could post a nice article in our website or upcoming interviews of our members on Athenian fringe stations. Anyways the internet only did half of the job. The rest was played by live activism. Greece and that's very unfortunate for national reasons (but good for us) is a higly urbanized and centralized country. Half of the population lives in the capital. That was a great bonus since if we achieved some success in the municipal level at Athens, it would be the break through in Greece as well. It was a shock for the populace that we elected Michaloliakos as a council member in Athens, as it was a shock and unexpected. As i said the internet played a role in that but the biggest asset was live activism. Countless propaganda campaigns on foot in the neighborhoods of athens helped in consolidating a 5% percentage at municipal elections. After that interest in our website skyrocketed. It was the second most visited site in Greece. Then things snowballed! As we consolidated our power, food deliverances came which helped us forming a social base in the premises of social solidarity.</p>

<p>The main pro of social media was that people could pass to their friends articles and invitations about events. But their was a con as well. Many fake profiles (mostly from anarchists) were set for setting falsified info for events or compromise unsuspicious people (personal data leakages, intimidations). So it was a double knife. But i doubt it was really valuable. After all as i said, the google search "golden dawn" and the interest in golden dawn sky rocketed on its own after the municipal elections.</p>

<p>As for the English languaged activism, it's a really valuable activity. Many people abroad could learn the truth about us, what we have to say. Foreign comrades could even get inspired in their own struggle and keep in touch with the happenings in this sensitive area so they can form their own political agenda on correct bases.</p>

<p>As for how the opposition uses mainstream media? Mostly lies and of the most hilarious and exaggerating kind. Horrendous psychological warfare on the populace and on the same time not offering a single minute to any of our members to counter the allegations and the lies. Infinite monologues with inexplicable lies, without a hint of a counter-argument.</p>
