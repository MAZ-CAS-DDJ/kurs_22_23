	Hey.
</p>

<p>
	I just had a talk about him with one of my friends, and I stated that I see mainly 3 archetypes of leaders in the historical era of Fascism: the traditional kings, who were almost all incapacitated one way or another; the pragmatic leaders, who were somewhat Fascistic, not because of ideals but because of the circumstances; and the true visionaries. You can easily apply this to Spain, Romania and Hungary for example.

	After WW1 Hungary was left without a king, and was taken by Horthy after he helped the Romanians to beat our Commies (we had a Soviet Republic in 1919). He ruled as a regent while preventing our king to reclaim his throne in 1921. At first he was against Fascism, calling the Arrow Cross members "<a href="http://jobbklikk.hu/pics/cikk/blog/108.jpg" rel="external nofollow">green bolsheviks</a>" and trying to ally with Britain; but most of the high ups were closer to Germany, and in time it became a geopolitical fact that we will be a part of the Axis. Almost all of the Hungarians from the foreign countries around us are seeing him as a hero since it was under his rule when some of our <a href="http://americanhungarianfederation.org/images/Trianon/trianon_changes.gif" rel="external nofollow">lost territories</a> were returned to us. His plan to betray Hitler and quit the war failed miserably though, and after his defeat came our own visionary, Sz√°lasi.

	While I understand some of Horthy's actions, and he was right in a lot of questions, I can't see him as an ally since he wasn't either a Fascist or a Monarchist. Basically he was the average Conservative of that time (I still have to read his autobiography though).

	Orban was trained by Soros; that's not a theory but a well-known fact here. He started out as a Commie, then became a Liberal in the '90s, and now he is a Cuckservative. He is not independent at all, every one of his actions are determined by the political atmosphere. He is purely pragmatic.

	About Jobbik... well, we have a thread on them <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/946-jobbik/" rel="">here</a>. It is a bit outdated though... I have a message to translate and post here, written by the Hungarian Traditionalist who tried to influence Jobbik. In this he states that he broke his ties to the party so those who were supporting Jobbik because of these ideals should do it no more. It looks like that Vona became a politician, and thus the Jobbik movement became a political party. I still have some faith in them, but I don't want to have illusions.
