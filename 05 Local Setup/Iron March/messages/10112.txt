<p>My cousin is a journalist....</p>
<p>and I agree, Bismarck was right when saying "Journalists are men who have not yet found their true calling"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My cousin is a little beta half-breed and when we were newborns I would bully him, not even joking, I was brutal as a baby. I think sometimes I was born violent for some reason. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You are right though, they are worthless and only make money off fanning social flames. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah, we have too many pussies around and not enough dicks. this world is in for a good hard dicking and I shall be the one to provide it</p>

<p>Conservatives are not our friends, they are pseudo-kikes who pretend to stand up for white, Christian values but theyre nothing but fucking cowards when it comes down to it,</p>
