	Greetings,
</p>

<p>
	  I've been following MD for close to 4 years now, both on VK and on any other media I've been able. Being from the northern United States I've been unable to find a chapter and done my best to be a lone wolf member of MD as best I could. I've only recently found out about Iron March, and now I'd like to apply for official membership to the organization. I'm a US soldier, physically fit, and believe I'm a worthy candidate. If you should see fit, please don't hesitate to ask me questions or contact me.

	Best regards,
