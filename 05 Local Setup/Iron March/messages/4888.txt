<p>"I am not sure if you are on facebook - 'Diggie Dee' who landed me the interview is still around"</p>
<p>Yeah i am on facebook. What interview? You mean the Stark truth interview or?</p>

<p>I like the idea that you are experimenting different things in your party "we must put every aspect of strategy to the test to see what works and what does not" And i personally think that is right way to go, example:</p>
<p>I dont know do you know the Swedish Resistance Movement,Finnish Resistance movement,Norwegian Resistance Movement and Danish Resistance Movement. Swedish Resistance movement started back in 1997, So they have operated for long time and maybe you could call them "professionals" because from experience they have over the years they know what works and what doesnt. So 2008 Some Finnish National Socialist started Finnish Resistance Movement, this movement isnt controlled by SRM, but they are working together and the main goal is to create alliance between Finland and Sweden. So it was somewhat "easy" to start a movement because they got all the plans and strategys from Sweden how to operate.</p>
