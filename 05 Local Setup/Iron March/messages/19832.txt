<p>
	He was exactly correct if you're talking about babbys first civilization religions. During the Classic Period (510 BC to 323 AD) they came closer and closer to monotheism. Hellenistic religions by the 2nd century were tending largely towards monotheism among <em>at least </em>the educated population.

<p>
	"...you will see one according law and assertion in all the earth, that there is one god, the king and father of all things, and many gods, sons of god, ruling together with him. This the Greek says, the Barbarian says, the inhabitant of the continent and he who dwells near the sea, the wise and the unwise." - Maximus of Tyre, 2nd Century
</p>

<p>
	That King and Father would be Zeus/Jupiter/etc.
</p>

<p>
	As for the Nordics/Germanics/Celts I'll just repeat what I said; we don't know exactly what they believed but we can assume it was the same or similar to the Hellenics.

	That'll be news to them, both because they don't worship Hitler and because he was an avatar/archetype, not purely a man.

<p>
	They don't think he was God and they don't worship him, so it doesn't really matter if he was imperfect. You fell for memes.

<p>
	As for the native European religions not making things clear/not outwardly showing things, that might be because they are dead and/or obscure. As for non-European Aryan religions, they are also obscure.

	Nobody worships Hitler. I don't know much about Odin, but I assume he was the Jupiter of the Nordic pantheon, who was considered to be an all-powerful creator God.
