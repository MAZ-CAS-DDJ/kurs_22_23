	I've been reading, and I have a question I don't completely understand. I wrote this to a Canadian Indian on Ironmarch.

		So you're Indian? If you are. Wouldn't you just be using whites to further your own goals as your people are MUCH worse off then mine (White)? (and that whites, even after a "golden age" won't really give two shits about the Indian birthrate?....

		Since Fascism is based on truth and of the organic state, would you accept yourself as probably being much lower on the "caste system" simple for your race? If I was an Indian I would have a great inner anger for whites because of their colonisation and virtual genocide of "my" people. Perhaps I would view whites similarly to the Jews to some extent. Wouldn't you then push into deeper "fascism" to eliminate the whites from the new world if you had the chance?

		This website seems to not care about race so much (I understand why), but since all races are working towards different END goals it doesn't make sense to me how we can work together or trust each-other in one group past a certain point.

		How do I know I won't get shot in the back at the end (as what usually happens).

		Let me just repeat myself in another way. Since (some) people on Ironmarch agree Jews are on average more "intelligent" then whites, then aren't Jews simply fulfilling their goal in the earthly "organic state", aren't we the lower class rebelling against the "superior class".. Or if I don't understand correct and people mean the organic state of ONE race in ONE territory, and the organic state of that race. In that case how can we work together with "fascists" of other races when they are all looking for different goals after this is over?
