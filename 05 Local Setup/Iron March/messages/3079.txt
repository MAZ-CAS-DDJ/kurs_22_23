<p>Turned on? You threatened to hack another nationalist over an ideological debate on a<strong><em> forum</em></strong>. Kind of nuts. I also didn't hear it from Aristocrat. And I don't talk with Aristocrat enough to call him my "buddy." He seems to like my posts though. And I don't "hate" people who support Asian regimes, I disagree with them. There is a difference. I really do hope you quit "caring" about me. Your shit-talking was quite tiring. My idea of a local movement is like what Ben and Alex have going, not "people on the internet." I believe I've explained before that my status as an agent of ZOG prevents me from doing anything outside the internet until my contract expires.</p>
<p>Maybe some day you'll mature enough to be able to play nice with others. If you look at the facts we don't disagree on all that much (I'd like to read some material about your movement).  I certainly don't have anything against you aside from this personality clash that seems to be going. I wouldn't have offered you combat training before your little Syrian adventure if I thought you were scum.</p>
<p>*I'm going to take everybody serious if they post in a serious thread. If Admins or whoever decide to troll in it and to violate the Charter and ruin a perfectly good thread with jokes that only their little clique understand, it's not exactly easy to spot. Vlad's mastery of sarcasm surpasses that of a Jewish comedian.</p>
