<p>Sounds like a plan.</p>
<p>Britain may be a bit of a bitch for you, if they let you in the country to begin with due to your record; after all they banned Don Black, Fred Phelps and that kike Michael Savage coming because of "spreading hatred" and they're pretty tame by our standards. That's where I've fled from; a few childhood friends with with the same ideas as mine are carrying on work and infiltrating and influencing the ranks in UKIP's regions, that's why I say to keep an eye on UKIP and how it changes and progresses. If this plan fails then NA is the primary one to get the backing.</p>
<p>Thailand and Vietnam are fun, watch out for the slopes on the fucking mopeds in 'nam though. I'll probably spend the rest of my life in Venezuela unless they find a way of getting me back home or if it looks like the pace is picking up and a chance of winning a fight against the system. In the mean time soaking up sun thanks to baby boomer, Nigerian and Yid money is a satisfying feeling.</p>
