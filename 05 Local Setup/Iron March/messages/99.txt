<p>No problem, I have been having a huge debate with the other admins on this issue, the rules are badly written, it has this weak thing about racism which is abused - but nothing about 99% of the problems which occur when a nationality or it's right to exist is dispataged. It takes alot of self control to give a measured response and it just escalates from there, I swear when fasces turned up part of me wanted to crush his evil french head.</p>
