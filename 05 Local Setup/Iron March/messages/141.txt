<p>One of my most typical fonts is Rodchenko something-something. RTT maybe. Can't say more till I get my new computer.</p>
<p>Indeed I had but for the same computer issue I can't work on any of my own projects, let alone forum projects. Out of those we only worked on making our own video channel. Will get back to that soon as my new PC is up. I can fill you in on more details then. Some im contacts would help if you want to work on these as well, specifically MSN or skype.</p>
