<p>The facebook page is something i've been considering doing for a while, look for it within the next few days.</p>

<p>I've never been on Twitter and am not that familiar with it, but if you think the effort would be worthwile it might be something to look into.</p>

<p>As far as the American members go your suspicions are probably correct. I have been contacted by a few Americans who were interested, but I don't know for sure whether they've joined or not. To a large degree this is understandable given the lack of historical Fascism here in the states and the propaganda of the NBU being primarily aimed at a British audience. When the NBU does start to gain publicity in Britain there will be spill over on this side of the Atlantic and I'm convinced at that point membership will pick up. Our challenge in the meantime is to make sure we have the organizational leadership and structure to take advantage of the opportunity. I don't know of any active members that participate here on Iron March. Most of the members here don't consider the NBU anti-semitic or racist enough to garner respect. I prefer to stick around here though and fight the good fight. i'm stubborn in that way.</p>

<p>I wouldn't waste your time on Stormfront. They're so obsessed with race they don't realize that even if you got rid of every non-white here and in Europe the problems which caused the muliticultural issue we currently have would still be here.</p>

<p>The only Fascist figure people here in the states are familiar with is Hitler, and only in respect to his policies towards Jews. I think we should take up the job of what I try and do on my personal Facebook page and educate people on the wide variety of Fascist thought that has been passed down through the years, not only Moseley, but Codreanu, Mussolini, Primo Rivera, Evola and many others. This is not going to be easy there's lots of educating to do, we're just going to have to be patient.</p>

<p>Now that I think about it your title might be divisional officer, i'm not quite sure since you'd be the only other officer here in the states. And I'm sure we could use whatever email you desire on the webpage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'll give you some recommendations on Mussolini tommorow. For now I've got to get some sleep.</p>
