	That's great friend, im not American nor am i staying in the US at the moment, but as said earlier i'm willing to help you guys with resources and posters. Which you can later simply print out and distribute or stick onto walls.
</p>

<p>
	I suggest you and <span style="color:rgb(224,224,224);font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:26px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;float:none;background-color:rgb(28,28,28);">Rise_Against</span> meet each other in real life when possible, also talk to your friends who are sympathetic to our cause about reviving the Silver Legion. The thing about starting a new Silver Legion is that this time it will be modern, no autistic uniforms, a simple red L is so easy to remember and will melt into people's consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	I suggest reading about the Legion and its founder William Dudley Pelley. We have a nice older thread on him and a metapedia article about the Legion that i will link to here. I will also link you to a thread on American Futurism by Alexander Slavros, that i believe would be perfect as the ideology for the modern Legion.

	Will you announce the creation of the new Silver Legion of America soon? It will excite many people i bet.
