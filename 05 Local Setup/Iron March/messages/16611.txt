	Thanks for the detailed respond - it seems that even though I didn't explain it clearly you managed to understand what I mean. I have discord, in fact I believe I have signed up unless I have to do that again. Thanks for the materials aswell - I am sometimes completely lost in the absolute variety of readings spread around the site but sure that helped. Btw, what happened with the idea of creating a server to put our materials Â and how much do you think it would cost maintaning it/expanding it per year ?
