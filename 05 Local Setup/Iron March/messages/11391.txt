<p>That feeling of hopelessness without money was one of the things that got me interested in state socialism. The USSR variety. To work and not have to worry about paying for rent or food sounds great, but that's TYRANNY and we can't have that.</p>

<p>Becoming a professor would crush your soul, I'm convinced.</p>

<p>Being multiracial, I don't have any ideal. I'm just sort of here. The government bux aren't technically from the gov.; it's coming out of my father's pocket. The child support that used to go to my mother will go to me starting next year. I plan on living with my parents until I'm twenty-two thereabouts. By that point, the money should have piled up since I wouldn't have to use it for rent or food or internet. Maybe then I'll have a plan.</p>

<p>But yeah, the money will dry up once he croaks, which might be in 10 or 15 years. He's 66.</p>

<p>I'm so lost, but I can't force myself to care. I hate this system, I wouldn't feel guilty at all if I were living off of some disability check. I don't know what I'll do. I'm not good at anything.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No one ever made me do anything, so I didn't. I don't have a license yet because I'm not interested in driving. I've never had a job, not even in fast food. I'm still just a kid, but I don't care. I don't want to be productive if I'm working in Kali Yuga.</p>
