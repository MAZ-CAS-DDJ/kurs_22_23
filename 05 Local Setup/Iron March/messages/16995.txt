	No I have no impression of you. I am not interested. I was Aryan Nations under Richard butler from 1990 till the scum morris dees took their land.  If your not local I see no way we can benefit each other. As well My Group  Order of Odalists takes all my free time. We are seperatists building  our own tribe and buying land.
