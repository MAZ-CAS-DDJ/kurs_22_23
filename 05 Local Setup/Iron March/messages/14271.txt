	Ha ha ha, yeah you are right about that. THIS TIME I SWEAR I WILL NEVER PLAY VIDEO GAMES AGAIN! <em><strong>Now, I am serious here so you can hold me to it</strong></em>. (not that I need you too, my willpower is more than up to the task)  I guess on the days I take a break I could just workout for an extra hour. Also, thanks for asking Hermann and let me know what he says
