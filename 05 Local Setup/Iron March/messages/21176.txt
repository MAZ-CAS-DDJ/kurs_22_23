	1. You have to comply to local laws. Criminal activity does no one any good. In terms of Australia, it varies a little bit per state but it's typically a civil offense rather than a criminal offense for racist stuff. There are clauses that state that it's okay under certain circumstances too.

	If the swastika is illegal, use another symbol. We all love the swastika but it's not worth getting jailed over it at this point. It won't achieve as much as other means would.

	Never speak to police, other than what you are legally required to give them (A name and address is standard here). Anything else should be "no comment" or your equivalent. Anything you say will be used against you. I will stress that again. Never tell them anything. They will try to threaten you, scare you, coerce you, tell you comrades have given up information (when they haven't) but never give in otherwise you are risking your own and your comrades wellbeing. Learn your local activist rights and laws. Loose lips sink ships.

	2. A thorough vetting procedure will help weed out most infiltrators / shills / informers but nothing is absolutely foolproof. When you meet with new people make it a procedure to give them a pat-down for wires / recording devices of any kind, get them to take out their phone, turn it off and leave it on the table. Ensure it's turned off yourself. Check glasses to see if there's a camera on them etc. It sounds paranoid and you can go as far as you want with this stuff. It's up to you.

	3. Every person involved upon meeting should not give a real name, unless the leaders want to hear the name of the member to do background checks. After that, they should take on a pseudonym that is a real name, however not their real name. That way you can call them by their pseudonym and not have it sound funny. The less people know the better as they cannot then give it up under duress.

	Secure communications are important. Do not talk openly about "I did" or "we did" when referring to people or actions. The only place you can say that if you need to is in person or secure channels. As an org, make your own secure channels or find your own and use those to discuss that type of thing. Protonmail or Tutanota is usually OK, at least at the start. Note that they only automatically encrypt to other tutanota or protonmail addresses.

	If you guys ever need any help, questions or advice you can ask me here. If you want another address to contact me on that's more secure in the future on whatever network let me know and we can work that out. I have a tutanota account for casual stuff that we could exchange if you have one as well.
