<p>Yes, I saw the thread. And basically...this guy is not worth my time. I'm on holidays with my little family, so I have other priorities than having an argument with someone so deeply entrenched in his bullshit.</p>
<p>And I don't see why he should be put at his righteous place, for he already is: in the gutter, where he belongs.</p>
<p>This being said I wish you and your family happy holidays! :-)</p>
<p>Best, Wib</p>
