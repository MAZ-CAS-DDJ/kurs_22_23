<p>There's a lot of truth to that. If you discard the people who got pushed to university through affirmitive action programs and take subjects of actual use like mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology - STEM courses basically they're actually intelligent. There's an undoubtable correlation between a person's level of education and intelligence, but that correlation is fading away with the dumbing down of education. Most people get intorduced to stupid ideas in university by marxist professors and foreigners who come over to study and bring their bizzare ideas. I don't like Gentile's idealism myself, I just like his anti-intellectualism or as he calls it, actual intelligence. Hell, I'll even agree with that nigger Thomas Sowell on some issues when he's right. I'm a truth seeker above all else. The fact is I agree with everything in the bible, there's nothing I can disagree with.</p>
<p>I agree with the sentiment. With faith and put into practice it could be done. Little do many people of christian faith know that resistance isn't outlawed in the bible. There is a time to kill and a time to overthrow corrupt kings and statesmen. There's a book I'm reading at the moment, it's called Vindiciae Contra Tyrannos. Very Interesting.</p>
