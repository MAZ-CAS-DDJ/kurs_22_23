	What re you doing for work?

	Lots new, took the plunge and moved out here. Been living it so far. Found 2 decent fabrication jobs but ultimately quit because I landed something incredibly better. Been making decent money, bought a new jeep, met a bunch of new NS guys. It's been a great change thus far I gotta say. How about you?
