<p>First thing to sort would be if you want to join the NOOSE staff on a permanent basis, meaning you'll have a profile on the website, read whatever drafts are available at the time and then pick out some to make posters for, or if you just want to toss in a design every once in a while, in which case we can just agree on some premise for this, like one design a week or month or whatever.</p>
<p>Secondly we already have one article that requires an immediate cover - it's on the recent Golden Dawn march. Ideally we want it out before Monday is out, so if you think you can do it it's yours, if not then we can continue discussing your arrangement with noose and what cover we might need for some upcoming article.</p>
