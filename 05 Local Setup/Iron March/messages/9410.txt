<p>Depends on the kind of gore, I always find gory war movies exciting, like the first one I watched when I was 7 or 8 (John Rabe) where the Japanese in Nanking behead Chinese soldiers. But most gory horror movies are a little boring and predictable, I prefer psychological thrillers. I've always found pictures of corpses from history interesting as well, the victorian memento moris, and old anatomy illustrations.</p>

<p>I guess I'm a creep too, I'm fascinated by symbols of mortality, and the Paris Catacombs.</p>
