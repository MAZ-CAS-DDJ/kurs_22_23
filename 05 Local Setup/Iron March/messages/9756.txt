<p>It's Brousse Royco's work, he's the AF official designer and we're tumblr mutuals, nice guy. </p>
<p>I need to start a band or something, and learn how to play guitar, because listening to music is pretty much the defining action of my life. It's how I conquer everything. </p>
<p>Including temptations. I refuse to be sedated!</p>
<p>It is an ok day, I am at english and reading some Beowulf. I was very pissed earlier because the stickers I designed and ordered ('zetazeroalfa fans from baltimore') came but I was in the shower and I didn't get to the door in time. Ah well. </p>
<p>Are you doing anything of note, or is it just one of those great days?</p>
