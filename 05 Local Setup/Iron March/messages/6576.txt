<p>    Well I'm sorry for making assumption about you man.</p>
<p>  I would say that all those religions mentioned by you and I are completely valid and in line with Tradition, but only Christianity is actually viable. The reason I say that is because none of those religions have a recent historical connection to the European identity, and if they do, as paganism does, they were overcome by Christianity and they are no longer practiced as a living tradition. And its not as if a new religion could be inspired or an old religion could be revived, because the modern world has been too rationalized. Christianity of a traditional stripe faces this same issue of an over-rationalized manner of thinking dominant in the masses, but Christianity is in a much better position then paganism since you could say it is only half-dead compared to being a completely dead religion. Europe could step away from its historically conditioned identity by embracing a foreign religion, but more likely going to be Islam rather then Buddhism.</p>
