<p>For those who do not know how to use IRC, let me give you a brief tutorial. IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat and it is basically just a means of chatting through the Internet. Various chatrooms, called channels, are hosted on different servers, all of which are accessed on an IRC client. These are simple programs that allow you to access an IRC server.</p>
<p>Now with all of that, let's get into the nuts and bolts. The lightest and easiest IRC client to use is Chatzilla which is an extension for Mozilla Firefox. I recommend everyone using this as it is the easiest to set up and to get chatting quickly.</p>
<p>As of this tutorial, the most recent Chatzilla version is 0.9.88. Open Firefox and click "Tools&gt;Add-Ons". From there search for Chatzilla. Install and follow the directions. When you restart your browser, open "Tools" and Chatzilla will now be listed. Open Chatzilla. This is the IRC client.</p>
<p>Now to join the server our channel is hosted on type the following command in the input line at the bottom:</p>
<p>/server irc.foonetic.net</p>
<p>and hit enter. This will take you to the the server.</p>
<p>Now the best thing to do at this point is to change your nickname to your username on the forum. On top of this, we are asking that users include the tag [iM] to their username so we can distinguish between actual users and trolls/lurkers. So to do this we type:</p>
<p>/nick yournick[iM]</p>
<p>After that, it is important to register your nickname, just like you would a username on a forum. Stolen identities are not good! So the next command is:</p>
<p>/msg nickserv register yourdesiredpassword youemail@address.com</p>
<p>You will get an e-mail asking you to confirm. Simply copy and paste the code you are given into the command line.</p>
<p>Now you are ready to start chatting! Type the following:</p>
<p>/join #IronMarch</p>
<p>and you should see myself or one of the other Admins in there. Any help you need, feel free to ask.</p>
