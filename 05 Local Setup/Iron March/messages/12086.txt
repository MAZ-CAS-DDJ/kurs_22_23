<p>Greetings from Greece brother. </p>
<p>I see you are Romanian and I would like to ask you something as i'm making a research about the Iron Guard. I witnessed some Greek surnames on the names list of the Iron Guard. They are most possibly Vlachs, but I was wondering if there was a strain of sympathizers among the Greek community towards the Iron Guard. Not members but sympathizers netherless. For instance I know that an Iron Guard delegation was sent in a meeting with the northern-greece based greek nationalist organization, the National Union of Greece. Anyway, if you have any relevant or something to refute this estimation i would be happy to hear it.</p>
