<p>I'm a Right Wing Republican in the sense that I believe in Roman Republican values. Family, duty, honor, and vibrant patriotism are all things I cherish. I'm sickened by the fact that our republic has lost these values and we have degenerated into pieces of shit that can't think beyond our carnal pleasures. In a sense, you can call me a Traditional Conservative in  that I have respect for high culture and community.</p>
<p>I do like fascist ideals though. The idea of the state being a natural entity that should serve to awaken the spirit within man is something that appeals to me also. I think Fascism also has a neat culture of Roman salutes and marches along with it's strong sense of patriotism.</p>
<p>However, the only thing I divert with Fascism on is it's dictator worship. A good Government to me is one that lasts, and no fascist government has lasted past the 20th century. Dictators aren't efficient forms of governments in my opinion. Therefore I adhere to Republicanism in creating a balance between dictatorship, the aristocracy and the people. I know it risks degeneration but it is better to have some state than no state.</p>
<p>What about you? What are you opinion on Governments?</p>

<p>I also really admire the government of the Roman Republic (the Roman Empire as well, but mostly for their militarism). The Founding Fathers would certainly be disgusted at the degenerate state of modern America, and especially at the way liberals justify their degeneracy by misrepresenting the ideals this country was founded on. </p>
<p>I partly agree with you about leaders. I do support an authoritarian style of republican government, and I think that leaders should be strong and have the ability to make decisions relatively independently, but they should still be held accountable to the law. I also have mixed feelings about democratically electing leaders, but there's really no better way to do it as far as I can see. If we eliminated the electoral college and set a reasonable limit on campaign contributions, our elections would probably get a lot more honest anyways.</p>
