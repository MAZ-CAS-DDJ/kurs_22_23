<p>thats good youre coming down from sickness. im doing good, listening to degenerate nigger instrumental music and drawing some things. I also just read an article about some scythian artifacts they found. they're golden bongs. seriously. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>and yeah I have noticed that lol, I can't tell if 40k attracts the fascist community or if it instills fascist values into its fans. I think its a bit of both because I got into warhammer pretty young, long before any political thoughts. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I love the imperium though, have you read that "Ave Imperator" post from /tg/? I've never gotten spiritual insight from a wargame before, that makes 40k special to me. </p>
