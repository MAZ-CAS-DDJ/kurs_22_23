<p>yeah the arguments are what turned me away from atheism "how can god exist if he's NOT FAAAAIR; like umm uhh there are people in the world who have never heard of him, they'd be going to hell, that's so unfair", that type of thinking. Despite being moronic and <a href="http://www.christianciv.com/ChristCivEssay.htm#Virtuous_Pagans" rel="external nofollow">answered by the bible</a>, not that they'd know that because they've never opened one and truly read it in their lives, it always hinges on moralistic arguments. A re-read of Dawkins god delusion before I became a pagan was quite frankly very unimpressive and a lot of it hinged on attacking "fundamentalists" and creationists, rather than actual christianity and religion, it rested more on morality "omigosh these here people don't like faggots and their ways and they think slavery isn't that fucking bad after all, omigosh, I'm frightened just thinking about what they'd do to my bitch ass".</p>
<p>Morality is the crux of the argument.</p>
<p>Atheism and right wing valus are completely at odds with each other, a true nationslist pays respect to what his nation once was, its roots and what it could be again; atheists and progressive "nationalists" just care about progress, they're materialists.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, it feels very liberating to become an unapologetic Christian, no biblical gymnastics, we just take and use the word as it is. Granted, it took a long time to grasp the basics and understand them in context, but it's so worth it.</p>
