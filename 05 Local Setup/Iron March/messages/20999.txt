	Sure I guess. If I had to describe Legionarism as short as possible I'd probably say it's Christian National Socialism. It tends to be focused more on the spiritual aspects including at the personal level than on race compared to National Socialism. Of course the other parts are not absent as both come from the same core worldview of Truth, it is merely how it expressed itself in Romania. Sadly this focus combined with the lack of proper understanding of what fascism actually is leads to a lot of stupid shit among would be legionaries from the old "legionaries were not nazis! their antisemitism was spiritual not biologic" to those who completely equate it with the dogma of the current Chruch which has some obvious elements of corruption in it.

	As for why I chose it, well I guess it had to do with how much Codreanu's words have resonated with me. Nothing else in this world has come anywhere close to it (minus Hitler). I'm also Orthodox (though not high on Orthodoxy) and Romanian as well. Beyond that I was attracted to it's martyrdom/death cult (The Legionary Movement had literal RIGHT WING DEATH SQUADS) as well as the concept of welcoming suffering as something that builds and strengthens character and soul. These last ones probably tie in a lot with own personal life experience.
