	Greetings friend!
</p>

<p>
	One of the spiritual authorities of the Hungarian Traditionalist circle told me that he heard about a Sufi tariqah that teaches the transcendent unity of religions; something we call Truth here on IronMarch. He said they are called 'Akhbariya' and it would be good if I could find out more about them. He has done very much to introduce Sufism to Hungarians and has personal ties to several Turkish Sufi groups too; so this tariqah have to be very good in hiding if he couldn't contact them yet. Also the System attacks him since they realized that he is a supporter of the Hungarian far-right so he can't afford to travel either.

	You are the best person I can ask about Sufi-related things; do you know something about them by any chance?
