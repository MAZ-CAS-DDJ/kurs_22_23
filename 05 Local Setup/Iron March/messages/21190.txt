	I didn't wanna double post in the thread, but I was wondering what's wrong with the EYU? I'm going over to Russia to visit family soon and wanna do a bit of activism before I go back, I'll have about a week. I don't get much news where I'm from here in the USA but my friend told me they were a racialist group so I wasn't sure. Are there any groups worth watching in Russia for their activism or is it kind of devoid of any good movements?
