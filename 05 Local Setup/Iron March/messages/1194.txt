<p>Well of course democracy means going backword's. It fringes on anarchy. 5 day vacation? Sounds interesting. Mind if I ask where you went?</p>
<p>I'm actually taking off to Nevada next week.</p>
<p>I think that I should look into reading about Shang Yang. I like to learn about National Socialism a lot too. Honestly, I have a lot of respect for Adolph Hitler and the Nazi's. It's too bad that they let their predjudice get the best of them and picked a fight with us, otherwise Europe would be so awsome today. I actually am trying to write my own manifesto. It'll take a while though. That is why I came to these forums to learn about Fascism and what I should incorporate.</p>
<p>And also if you don't mind me asking, what do you mean by romantic frustration?</p>
