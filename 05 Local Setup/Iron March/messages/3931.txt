<p>Sounds like Malta is a nice place. Maybe too nice for people to get angry enough to form a radical party. Seems like immigration is a problem everywhere. It sure is here. When I go to the city (Adelaide) Half the people I see are Asian. It's frustrating. There is a group here called Nationalist Alternative which I am considering joining. But I don't know any other fascists personally although my mate told me he saw a skin head girl in the city so I've been keeping my eye out for her haha.</p>
