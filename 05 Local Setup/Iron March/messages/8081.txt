<p>I don't think there's really a "creative writing" section. The place where the books and articles written by members goes is in the "archive" section, under the "member's materials archive". I'm not sure that Slavros will like having fiction posted there though, but you better ask him directly if you don't want to take the chance to just post it there.</p>

<p>Otherwize, "cancer" might be the right place after all - some members post things there voluntarily, generally entertainment-based stuff belongs in cancer (for example, the administrator's gaming channel is in cancer). Don't worry about the title of the section, posting things there means you don't take it totally seriously, which will make the other members judge it more favorably.</p>
