<p>Not too different from other occidental countries. Though this year we will have more protests and there's some groups wanting to start a "revolution" , but they don't have guts and this could happen just if the police use too much force. But I think it's possible something huge happens here this year , in my city they even placed bombs on a military parade.<br /><br />And how are things in USA?</p>
