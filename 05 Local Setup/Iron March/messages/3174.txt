<p>The nordic model as in a social democratic wonderland? ''Folkhemmet''? </p>
<p>I don't really dislike the idea of it, in fact I praise it. To an extent, of course.</p>
<p>Right now Sweden is having a massive immigration combined with a mindset that ''everyone who is against this immigration and multi culture is a racist''. I think this is scary, our values that make Sweden what it is is being destroyed. Our society is polluted with extreme feminism and the fear of offending every single little minority that exists. Meanwhile we have a huge influx of negroids and arabs too who gets a huge welfare check for doing nothig. They don't even have to learn Swedish. I can't summ up this problem in just a few sentances, you wont truely understand untill you see a Swedish politician making a rapist into a victem and the real victem into a racist. I am not joking there, sadly.</p>
<p>Now. I am not against welfare programs, In fact, I support them. However I believe that people need to fail and face the consequences. They should not starve, of course. I consider a roof over every Swede's head and food on his or her table as a sort of minimum standard.</p>
