<p>You both have a group in your areas which you work with, right? I had the idea of doing something like Golden Dawn did in greece, handing out food. If we could convince people to start growing front-lawn gardens, especially where against zoning laws, it could be a nice stunt to help draw attention. Using any extra food or "forgotten foods" to feed the poor would be a nice bonus for positive images</p>
