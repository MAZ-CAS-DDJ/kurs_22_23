<p>I don't really care that you are a mischling as long as you don't try and ever claim that you are racially superior like other whites.</p>

<p>There's no problem with keeping a low profile. If you are going to join the military as long as you don't have swastikas or "evilnazi6million" tattoos you should be fine. My cousin has a wolfsangel (pretty known symbol by now) and he's a marine and he had no problem enlisting. You'd be surprised by how many brothers/sisters who are with the movement in the military, they just keep it low profile like you said.</p>

<p>Don't worry about the kike priest and shit just say everything he wants you to say (should be obvious). I got sent to a psychiatric hospital for beating on a nigger in school and was locked up for beating two spics in the woods and I'm only 18 turning 19 next month so don't even worry about it. </p>
