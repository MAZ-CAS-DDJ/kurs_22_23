<p>Seem so. Since the ancient history, as in Egypt, the white man build, and black man screw up everything. Looking at certain view, the kaffers are ilegal there, because when the dutchs arrive in South Africa, there was no one there; the blacks just came when they seem "something strange" called start of a civilization.</p>

<p>Apartheid was the better thing that happined for South Africa, not only for white people, but for the blacks. There is inumerous black mans wanting the Apartheid back. The so "hero" Mandela, killed hundred or even thousand of his own people for diamonds, and now, his followers want to kill who build that country. Without boers, there is no food, no energy, no civilization.</p>
