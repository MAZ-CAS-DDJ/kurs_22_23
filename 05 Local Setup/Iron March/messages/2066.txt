<p>I wanted to keep my promise by not replying in the Jew Thread, but you said some things in it that interested me and were worthy of a response. And since you were one of the more thoughtful posters I wanted to reply somehow. Also because some of your post confused me.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="638" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div> Your example does bring up the issue, which relates even to your 'Jewishness'. When it comes down to it, if the healthy part of Jewish values are compatible with the German, are they not one in the same?[/Quote]<p>If the healthy part of Christian values are compatible with the German, are they not one in the same?</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>I would have to ask you what you think German values are.</p>
<p>If German values are industry, production, and innovation, then Jewish secular culture has always been this. Austrian emperors such as Franz Joseph preferred Jews in business over others because he knew they had been good for the empire.</p>
<p>I cannot deny the massive contribution Judaism has made to German culture. Or that German Jews are partly responsible for the existence of Germany in the first place.</p>
<p>When people mention Jewish values and "German" values, they confuse me. Especially since secular Jewish culture in Germany has always considered itself German, just not Christian German.</p>
<p>It went so far that German Jews thought they were superior to any other group of Jews. Often Jewish non-Germans were discriminated against by German Jews.</p>
<p>Being German and being Jewish were never mutually exclusive. This is a concept invented by radical National Socialists only, and was often opposed by Germans in Austria, Switzerland, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the knowledge of history for many non-Germans ends with Hitler. Many do not know, for example, that many Germans considered themselves Prussian or Bavarian (not German)--as Austrians today consider themselves Austrian. Or they forget Deutschland was a political union of states.</p>
<p>People did not agree as much then on what a German was as they do today.</p>
<p>When the states were unified, being a German was a somewhat new idea. And German values a vague concept.</p>
<p>---------------------------------</p>
<p>But mostly I do not understand how if I were Christian this would be considered German without question.</p>
<p>Even though I find mainly non-Germans think German Jews are less German than German Christians. Most real nationalistic Germans today are proud of the long list of German Jewish scientists, doctors, and otherwise geniuses that advanced and continue to advance Germany even today. Because they were German.</p>

<p>I feel this may be the case when I see mentions of "Talmud" and Pharisee. Many Jews don't use a Talmud. They reject it as legitimate. For example, Karaite Jews.</p>
<p>Also "Talmudist" and Pharisee are meaningless words.</p>
<p>If you want to refer to Jews like that, then I think you are referring to either Orthodox or Hasidim.</p>
<p>But most Jews are not Hasidic or Orthodox.</p>
<p>As for my Jewishness.</p>
<p>I resent that if I were Christian, this would be a non-issue. I also consider this to be nonsense. As far as actual religion goes, Judaism is more logical than Christianity is anyway. Christianity is built on self-contradicting truths. So the pro-Christian argument for being German is absolute nonsense to me.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say, but if all Germans had always been Christian, Germany would have had far fewer advances.</p>

<p>Only Jewish secular culture is materialistic. As is all secular culture--although secular Jews may be better at it than secular Christians.</p>
<p>Jewish religious culture suggests owning things is a bad thing, and that charity is more useful. The Christian monk aesthetic is a Jewish aesthetic.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="638" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>I think it is a matter of cultural nepotism, so even though I don't see Jews as a race, I recognize that their cultural and social identity amounts to a 'racial' identity in practice.[/Quote]<p>I consider Christians a race in that way too.</p>
<p>So ok.</p>
<p>I know people in my family who would argue moreover that Catholics are often anti-German and representative of foreign Italian/Roman/Vatican power.</p>
<p>And yet I am willing to accept German Catholics as German, although some Jews in my family consider them completely non-German and instead dedicated to Roman Catholic power.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="638" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>So, I say communism was either a golem of certain Jews or simply a vehicle to gain power.[/Quote]<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>Communism was a plague inflicted on Judaism.</p>
<p>Jews were constantly trying to leave the USSR.</p>

<p>Which is why Marx opposed Zionism and hated Jews. He opposed religion.</p>
<p>And for many Jews, even if they are atheist, the religion is still valid and they raise their children Jewish.</p>
