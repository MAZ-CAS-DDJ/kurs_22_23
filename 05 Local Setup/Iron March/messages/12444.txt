<p>No problem. Being formal is fine but I'm just letting you know it's not necessary. Stop apologizing so much too. Instead of saying "sorry to bother you", you should just say "thank you for your time". Same politeness, but no submissive attitude. It may seem incredibly insignificant, but it has an effect on your psychology.</p>

<p>I suppose I could call myself pagan, but I don't do that generally. I hold no resentment to Christians, but I was never drawn to the religion in a spiritual sense, whereas I am with the old gods. Both are paths to the same destination, I'm just drawn to this one. I was, however raised as a Lutheran. Are you a Christian or did you have a religious upbringing?</p>
