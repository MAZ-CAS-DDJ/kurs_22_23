<p>While I may disagree on the State raising children and a few basic tenets of your views, you more than any other American seem to understand Fascism for why I espouse it and why it's necessary in the first place; National Greatness, the Preservation of Civilization, and building an Organic Society. I'm quite close to AB, was close to a few other members but my inactivity has cut that down (just started a new job and so I'm busy quite often). Most other members seek to push some other agenda, while I find that it in fact is counter-productive to very purpose Fascism has. The art of statecraft is a fickle thing, and I dont believe any two people would ever envision the exact same State. Regardless I feel the Union must be preserved, perhaps with greater cultural integration without showing too much favor to any one group, except perhaps a slight bias toward the English (I say this as an Irish-American) because they had a greater role than any other Nation in America's foundations.</p>
<p>As for Skype, I'll shoot for Wednesday, around 7 central time. Provided that doesn't happen I'll be home and free all of Saturday before the evening and all day on Sunday.</p>
