<p>Here young people dont give a fuck about globalism and liberal values.. But when the other countries have a mafia. Our mafia have a country. But their days are numbered.. Well its on your signature: United we cannot fail... Its better to be in organization that dont share exactly your views than to sit on your ass and do nothing..</p>
<p>Putin politics are mainly dictated by fact that Russian Jewish oligarchs dont want to be servents on their US brothers and because of that they decide to play opposition for now. So i dont bet any hope that when there is no external threat for Russian jews they will keep in current way. You might talk to Svitanok on this matter he is way better informed on this matter and can tell you things on first hand.</p>
<p>As for your coming why not.
