	How do you mobilize the people in the US? Its been tried.

	Fascism is counter-revolutionary. First against Communism/Social Democracy. Now we're revolting against 1789 which was a revolution against truth and the natural order. We're still revolutionaries but we're countering the revolution of 1789 which enforced Left-Wing ideologies that has degenerated society ever since. Products of the rationalist classic liberals that thought the Enlightenment was "progress".

	I'm not sure why you keep saying this but a fascist govt won't rise in the US, thats my point and I was pretty clear on that. But a organic state or nation can which is the goal of fascism.

	Now what I call natural law is what happens to all the non-whites, disabled, white welfare recipients (eg "intellectuals") or race-mixers that cannot get better positions in society through equality anymore, which is presented as a inherent good in politics but in reality its so that they get favourable treatment by federal/state funds &amp; regulation to get undeserved positions eg welfare, low-income housing, affirmative action, scholarships for non-whites, quota's &amp; anti-discrimination laws. I've already explained what happens to them, eventually we'll fight them out of our own destabilized states &amp; by anyone else who's got the balls to avoid being bullied/attacked by angry gangs doing the only thing they are good at A' la Haiti/S.Africa post-Apartheid, ie destroying any relics/civilisation they are left with and anyone that is better off than they are.

	Saying thats theoretical its like saying that the crime statistics amongst blacks is "theoretical", their smaller brains by about a quarter pound, their 70 IQ in Africa or 85 IQ in the US, that whites/asians are the best weight lifting champions is all just coincidence. Its not like we are all inherently different from other races or anything and always get along in proximity. Scarce resources are surely not going to be a source of conflict....Get your shit together <img alt=":ropecult:" data-emoticon="" src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/ropecult.png" title=":ropecult:" /></p>
