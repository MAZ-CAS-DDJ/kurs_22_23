<p>Why Western Canada? And why Civic nationalism?</p>
<p>Civic nationalism seems like a contradiction to me because it ignores that a large part of what a nation is is in its blood. It pains me to see Quebec in a bid to preserve their language (which is important don't get me wrong) they have their own immigration policy but completely ignore the integrity of their ethnic heritage. Yes, Quebec can be French-speaking if you import thousands of French-speaking negroes and North Africans. But it won't be French. Can you imagine Nova Scotia without Scots? Newfoundland without the English?</p>
<p>I think that Canada's stated policy of multiculturalism can actually be used to a nationalists advantage. The government should accept and encourage each 'nation within the nation' as the Prime Minister said to foster and maintain it's ethnic, linguistic, and cultural heritage free from outside influence. Including Canadians of European descent.</p>
<p>I've recently met a few Chinese from Vancouver at my school. The Chinese speak Chinese at home and with their peers, consume predominantly Chinese media, and the way their communities have grown in that city he grew up mostly around other Chinese, secondly around other East Asians (Korean, Japanese, etc.) and only lastly among other peoples. I also grew up with a few people who were immigrants from Europe to my hometown who associated mostly with fully Americanized Canadians. They slowly stopped speaking their native tongues, participating in their culture, and seeking news about their homelands. By degrees they became simply became generic 'white Canadians' watching American TV and adopting American values.</p>
<p>I'm curious though - what do you have so far for your party platform and 'Civic nationalism'? What do you think will allow Canada to stand against US media and influence?</p>
