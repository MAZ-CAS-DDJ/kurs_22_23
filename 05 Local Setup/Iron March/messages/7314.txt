<p>Alright,  I appreciate the reply.</p>
<p>I think I'll do what you recommended and start with his spiritual works, then the metaphysics and so on. I'm not looking to read the minimum and I'll probably read a lot of his work. I'll also be sure to purchase your book once it's out.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
