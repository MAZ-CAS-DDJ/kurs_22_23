<p>Hey all, as you may or may not have already noticed we've engaged in some reforms on IM, namely new Charter + Mission Statement, updated Introduction Guidelines, new systems put in place to prevent bots and shitposting without making an introduction topic and also the entire former Black Corps team save for KU has been cleared out as they don't do jack shit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've selected the lot of you as the potential new Iron March moderators because you all seem responsible, trustworthy and level headed so I don't imagine you'll start banning people left and right. Also you seem to be regularly active.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The main responsibilities of the Black Corps include:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>forum upkeep, that is to say moving topics to appropriate forums/subforums when they were placed somewhere else erroneously by their creators; merging double and multiposts; removing pictures and videos from quotations if those appear immediately after the post from which they are quoted or on the same page (if they are quoted to another page that's fine).<br> </li>
<li>dishing out warnings and ultimate punishment, which is ultimately at your discretion, you may give them 3 warnings and then the boot if all warnings accumulate in the course of the same week (you can issue those warnings verbally or using the warning system that becomes accessible to you once you're mods, but then you have to learn to use it properly and remove old warning posts so as to not confuse other mods) or you can ban people on the spot if the situation merits it.</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course you're expected to be active users all the same while also being active mods, the old team literally did nothing save for KU and he's busy with FRM right now ergo why we're restaffing the Black Corps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I need a show of hands from you who are willing to take on this responsibility and who think they can manage to follow our general common sense stipulations i.e. fun is allowed but don't go full retard, don't sperg, don't role-play etc, read the new forum charter if you need to familiarize yourself with this again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another aspect of this would be that ideally I need you to be available on skype to discuss forum maintenance and bans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So what say you? </p>
