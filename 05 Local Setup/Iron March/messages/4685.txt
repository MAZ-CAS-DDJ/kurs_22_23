<p>Russians sympathies with Catholicism against Protestantism when questioned but are generally apathetic toward all religion including Orthodoxy. I don't know where you got the idea that Russians hate Catholics but it isn't real. I would argue the Protestant church is considerably more universalism and liberal in the respect to its power and the scope of personal discretion upon spiritual matters. Protestantism in itself is a revolution against hierarchy, hence the charges of its corruption, when Protestantism establishes its own hierarchy and places the same power in different hands- literally millions of hands, as opposed to one unified church. Islam? Islam is foreign and adversarial, though I imagine Russians when they do give a fuck have more respect for spiritually serious Eastern religion than Western religious flirtations and promiscuity, which is exponentially pervasive in the Protestant world.</p>
