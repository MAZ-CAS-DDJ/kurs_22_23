<p>Hey good to hear from you. From what I saw on the Barnes and Noble website it looks like the comic book release will be one of those Jap manga comic things. Ordinarily, I wouldn't even consider getting it sense I hate anime and manga but sense it is Legend of the Galactic Heroes I may buy it. Of course I would order it because there is no way I would walk into Barnes and Noble to buy it because I ain't a fucking weeb or whatever they call themselves. But, yeah I liked it because for once a monarchical/aristocratic Empire and the people that fight for it are not portrayed as evil. It also, did a good job of showing the corruption and ineffectiveness of democracy. I mean lets face it people like us would side with the Empire in a heartbeat. Also, my impression of Phezzan and the Earth Cult is that they are completely like the Jews (that will become clear more later on). I won't spoil anything for you sense you have only seen the first 30 episodes (there are 110 episodes and yes I have seen them all) My main complaints are pretty much similar to yours and I will admit the I did not like the ending (but I won't spoil it for you). Needless to say with 110 episodes a lot of stuff goes on. Also, would you mind if I sent you PM's every once and a while to see were you are on the series and maybe discuss it, or you could send me a PM and do the same thing. If that is alright with you. Anyways, please let me know if you get this.</p>
