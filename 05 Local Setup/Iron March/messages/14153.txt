	Wow, I must say I am surprised to see someone on IM that would have tried AA. And also congratulations! I will also have 2 years sober on the 26th. Like other people said exercise and education definitely helps my physical and mental state, but AA has helped me a lot, though it not being my primary tool. Once again congratulations sir!
