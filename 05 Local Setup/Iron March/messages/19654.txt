	Germans were always tribal and not meant to be unified , unified societies collapse , tribal societies where they have to raid and fight neighboring tribes remain strong , which is why they were always raising fighting age men and could create temporary alliances like when Arminus Herman did at Teutoburg. then they went back to tribal warfare leaving the empty forests full of Romans nailed to trees as a reason why Germania should be left to nature.

	Only after the migration and Charlemagne and several saintly Expeditions northward was the tribal structure crushed.

	Christianity literally corrupted and destroyed one of the most organic areas on the planet.

	I'll never get to fight with swords in the woods wear tribal paint  and have an actual woman that I love I wish I was my ancestors.
