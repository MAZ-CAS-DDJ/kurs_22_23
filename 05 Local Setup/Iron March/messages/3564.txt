<p>The adminship already know about our little back and forth, they are laughing their asses off, and you will notice members of the adminship are liking my posts <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/1835-greetings/page__st__100__p__47216#entry47216" rel="">http://ironmarch.org...7216#entry47216</a></p>
<p>Sorry you can't weasel your way out of this one, even if you sit around waiting for the moment I come online to shoot me a PM. You know, you can send these things anytime you want, I'll still only get to them after I get to my computer. Also, happy new year.</p>
<p>I wish you would just send the photo and be done with it, it isn't all that hard. Maybe it's your jewish arrogance, but you are going to have to get over that.</p>
