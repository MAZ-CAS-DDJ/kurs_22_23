Definitely sympathetic but I’m more of a Traditionalist a la Guenon and Evola, and an Integralist along the lines of Action Francaise. Whereas the ENR is more of a strategy than a worldview. It does contain different worldviews within its folds – such as Archeofuturism, which I noticed is the theme of your private blog. That’s definitely an idea I’d like to see fleshed out. We’ve got an Archeofuturist blogger on the forum, and the guy the runs the forum has recently been playing around with similar ideas.</span></span></span></p>
