	putting my feelings about you and AU aside I wish my full condolences to the suicide of your sister. I will do a rosary for her. Honestly I couldn't know what it feels like to lose a sibling but regardless my it's a shame you have to go through that being young. A lot of Sad Deaths have been going on. Sad Times.
