<p>Yeah agree completely. The firebombings were ill-timed, &amp; gook restaurants were kinda shitty targets, but when you read The ANM Story you'll see his reasoning &amp; it might have worked if he'd been a little more patient, you'll dig some of the clever shit he pulled. Bob Mathews- from US' The Order? Wouldn't be surprised if the ANM took some inspiration from them. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_cool.png" alt="B)" />  Gotta agree, when the system shuts us out politically violent struggle's all that's left. The Aussie scene' way too disorganised for it at the moment tho, I reckon.</p>

<p>I am from the city, I wage slave in one of those office buildings in the CBD lol. Got family in the mines though, respect those who work out there, must be a tough slog. And yeah if you're ever up here we should suss out catching a beer. If I haven't found a library copy of the ANM book that they can loan out to Albany (will be getting on that soon), you can borrow mine then no fuss. Also got a spare copy of Alfred Rosenberg's book I'd be happy to offload for free, Amazon mailed me two copies for some fucking reason.</p>
