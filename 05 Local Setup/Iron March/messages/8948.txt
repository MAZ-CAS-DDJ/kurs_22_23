<p>I remember when I was working at Wal-Mart in Kansas one German-American says 'there are no pure races' in front of a manager. I could've bitten my tongue off I was biting it so hard. <br /><br />But yeah if you're subtle about race stuff you can talk to people about it. I've spoken about how race is determined by skull shapes and shit. I usually talk about forensics and the like. It's a somewhat lame indirect way of doing it, but it can be fun trying to work the system a bit.</p>

<p>I'm writing a pro-hate speech paper for my final. I'm going to my rough draft conference on Monday. It'll be really fun cause my professor has a name on the same tier as "Goldberg" so I'll see how it goes. </p>
