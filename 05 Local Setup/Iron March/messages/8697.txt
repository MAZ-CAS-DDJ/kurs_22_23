<p>Wouldn't mind going for a fish next time I'm over there. I was thinking about starting a fishing and hunting thread here. Me and my dad do a fair bit of spearfishing here in VIC. Going for tuna at Portland for Anzac Day, last two years we've bagged out on them (2 each), and then caught a few extra albacore. End up eating them for months afterwards. </p>

<p>Do you do much shooting over there? I think we've got a deer hunt lined up in June or July, we get sambar up in the forest. Also do a bit of playing around with foxes and rabbits a few times a year. </p>

<p>I like 'Australian Action', and from the reading I've been doing lately, I reckon it's important to use Australia-specific points of argument. As in criticism of internationalism/cultural marxism etc. from an Aussie perspective, what it really means for us, which a lot of the things Nationalist Alternative post do. I don't think race issues even need saying really, the thing about Oz is that even people without any political views hate blacks/browns/yellows, and say it. The important thing is 'Australian spirit'; for Anzac Day, we should get people asking if this is the Australia which the diggers sacrificed themselves for? Most of the veterans would of course say 'fuck no', but most people see no problems.</p>

<p>I didn't get down to the Reclaim Australia since I was away, but watching it on the news I realised how good a potential it has. Socialist Alliance burnt the aussie flag here, the cunts. They say they represent the 'real Australia' which welcomes immigrants and muslims and whatever, and then they burn the flag? Anyone can see something's not right about that. </p>
