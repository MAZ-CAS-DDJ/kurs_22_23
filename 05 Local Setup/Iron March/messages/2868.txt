<p>"We both agree welfare is not a "right" - the difference is you see it as a privilege that needs to be earned, while I treat it more as a responsibility that comes with requirements. "</p>
<p>Kinda sorta. I see it as a benefit of citizenship, not so much a privilege, and one earned through responsibilities.</p>
<p>"To clarify though, when you say, "we see a Welfare State where in order to even be a part, you must prove your dedication and worth through military service, <strong>and then actively work to improve the State</strong>, and in return your needs are seen to by the State as a whole," is this saying that to receive welfare, you must effectively be a State employee, e.g. on some public works project?"</p>
<p>This is where we have a breakdown in definitions. Most, including most modern fascists unfortunately, use the same definition of the "State" as anarchists, and as set forth by Max Weber, in that a state is any group of humans who successfully maintains a monopoly on the legitimate use of force within a territory, synonymous with the power structure of a government. I, however, use it in the classical sense, as well as it is used in English dictionaries such as the OED, where a State is the body politic of the nation organized with a single, shared government. In short, the organization made up of the citizens of the nation who have a vested interest in public affairs makes up the State, so if you do something to improve or benefit the State (i.e. the collective citizen society), then you are Serving the State.</p>
