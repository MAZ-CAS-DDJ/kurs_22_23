<p>It took me a while to get used to the stink of niggers. They really fucking smell, that is the first thing I noticed. Second seeing so many homeless takes getting used to. Third, cost of living is high most products are 2-4 Times what it costs in Europe with the notable exception of alcohol and gas. </p>

<p>Anyway it was a close shave getting in, homeland security would have sent me back probably if torren wasn't waiting for me and had his phone. Things have been on the edge since but I have not been in actual danger of anything happening. This week for example; Torren has been in two fights, and he left a Stanley knife blade sticking out of the floor that went through my foot (healing very well though) and things have been slow recently, as I have been letting him and ralee spend time together.</p>

<p>Torren has been enormously hospitable to take me in, though with the drugs and menstrual cycles  It is super easy to offend people - but everyone chills out so it is good, and with money not being an issue I haven't pissed anyone off for a good reason. </p>

<p>Ralee is adorable, though it is dawning on her that I am going to be with her boyfriend for a long time. Thankfully not something I am sexually attracted to, not that was ever in question but it makes things easier. She is brainwashed by the way, it is weird to see something so innocent be completely unphased by her surroundings - not sure how to explain it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Honestly a very exciting lifestyle compared to what I am used to. I need to come up with some ideas soon to make myself more interesting.</p>
