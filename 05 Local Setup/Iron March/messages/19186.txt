	Honeslty I am not sure if I would be interested in joining Atomwaffen. Still need to check the group out though.  The group I am working with is trying to get a sorta normie friendly group going called the National Union Party, it is a fledgling group right now.  <a href="https://www.minds.com/blog/view/704340742750871559" rel="external nofollow">https://www.minds.com/blog/view/704340742750871559</a>.  We have DS book clubs in Canada, some parts of the south and Kansas that are setting up.  As I said if you are interested in it you can join, and I will introduce to the others in the kansas group I am with to Atomwaffen.  It is a new movement so you may very well see me join you with Atomwaffen if the group disbands.
