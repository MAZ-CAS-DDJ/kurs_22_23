<p>I don't know if you are still online. My reply now will have to be quick and short as I have to get to work soon. I forgot to check out your YT channel, and I will do so tonight when I have time. I know of the NazBol movement and I think they are essentially good people but their understanding of history is shit and makes no sense, I can get into explaining why I think so some other time. I will also have to deal with the Israel thread later.</p>
<p>We'll talk more tonight.</p>
