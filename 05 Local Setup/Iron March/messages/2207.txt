<p>Where do you stand politically, not just ideologically?</p>
<p>That is interesting. What is your impression of me then?</p>
<p>You can be honest.</p>
<p>Hopefully not a Cock. But I can deal with that label.</p>
<p>I agree. I find the alpha male fascist argument is used to discredit the other when someone has no more arguments.</p>
<p>There are only two women I know of. Woman in Black and a half asian pseudo Nazi. I forgot her name.</p>
<p>I think this must be because generally, women are less political than men. And I find that political women are often enticed by feminism and liberalism instead.</p>
