<p>Before I get gassed, I wanted to let you know that your book is very useful, and I've been using it while having arguments with liberals at my work place and other places.</p>
<p>A few others have actually been compelled to read Mein Kampf after having been convinced about Nationalism and the far Right in general. </p>
<p>It's an excellent tool, and I felt it would be dishonorable to take all the credit for the things I have achieved so far in my community as far as organizing and educating, and arguing with the left. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
