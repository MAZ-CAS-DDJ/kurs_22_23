<p>People always tell me that the reason I feel this way about casual sex is because I've never had it.</p>
<p>I just can't, though. I'm too insecure. I hate everything about myself. I, for some reason, can't attract girls, or at least not available girls.</p>
<p>There is a girl, two years younger than me, that I have a class with, and she, I'm pretty sure, wants to fuck. She has done many things in the past few months to hint at it. Told me I have pretty eyes, told me I'm funny, told a friend of mine that I'm sexy, tried to sit beside me in class and talk to me, made kissing faces at me when I'm literally just driving around in my car (she was standing outside the school, and I drove by it one day). She's actually quite good looking too. The problem is that she has a boyfriend.</p>
<p>Either way, I'm just too socially fucked. A friend told me about this forum, and I decided to post here. Thing is, no matter what I do, I always end up talking about how depressed I am. </p>
<p>I'm sorry for bothering you with shit you don't care about.</p>
