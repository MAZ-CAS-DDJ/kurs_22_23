<p>I just want to say that I'm not here to make trouble or to provocate other members. I will not continue to post in that thread out of respect, it's better to clear some things over PMs. What I believe in is the fascist tradition of my part of the world. You have some fair points about immigrants and how I would feel about them if there were thousands of them here, but let me ask you, would you promote racial ideas in the same way as you do know if you were living in basically a 100% white country as I do? It's just too abstract here and doesn't fit into any political tradition. I don't think we have to necessarily choose between retarded anti-racism we have to endure today or the other extreme which is nazi/wn-like ideology. Perhaps you have to in USA and I respect this, but things are different here.</p>
<p>I didn't want to provocate other people with my views but these are the views in line with what nationalist tradition teaches us here. Sometimes we on the "far right" argue so much that we forget that in this sick world we're still on the same side no matter what.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
