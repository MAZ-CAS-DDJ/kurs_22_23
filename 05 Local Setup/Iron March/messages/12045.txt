<p>Thanks! This is definitely the haircut I am going to go for. Unfortunately, I have to grow my hair out until March in order to get it cut like this, so I have a long time to wait. Patience is not really my thing, so it is going to be hell waiting for my hair to grow. But, yeah I just figured when I did get it cut I would say something about it in Trivial Happenings without posting a pic. With the plan that if someone asked for a pic I would just tell them NO or to "F Off" I just wanted the pic as a possible (though unlikely) option and possibly your help if I did that. But, I guess it would be pointless because it would just look like my last pic (black face mask included) only with better hair lol. So it would probably be pointless anyways. I also really just wanted your feedback on if the hairstyle looked good or will look good with my brown hair. So, you think it would look good?</p>

<p>PS I will <strong><em>always</em></strong> cover my face if I post a pic here.</p>
