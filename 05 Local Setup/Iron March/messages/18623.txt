	Probably most Americans have some ethnic mixing , but Celtic and Germanic in my opinion isn't that mixed since they lived next to each other in Europe during Ancient times there was some mixing between Celtic and Germanic tribes , the Romans recorded it. Tacitus wrote about it in Germania. that's not counting the British Isles which basically the Saxons and Angles mixed with the native Celts.

	I transferred to online university at Arizona State University's program, from my university here in Georgia I went to in person, I wanted to go to a better school but I didn't want to move to another state and have to get an apartment or dorms so this worked out pretty good, plus I have time to lift weights.
