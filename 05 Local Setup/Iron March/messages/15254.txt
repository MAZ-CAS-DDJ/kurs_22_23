	Hey mate, saw that you said you were in <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>. Was just wondering how you ended up joining. Working with some lads over here in Aus at starting our own similar group, one problem here tho is just small population density, so were havin a bit of trouble with recruiting. Just wanted to ask if you had any tips to find those fashy lil goys who might be hiding away
