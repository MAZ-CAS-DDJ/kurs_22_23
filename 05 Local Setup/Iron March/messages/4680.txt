<p>Give them that or paraphrase yourself and be done with it. Many people have tried to work against God, many have tried to topple Christianity, all have failed, the most recent attempt being Ben Klassen's Creativity. These people are small and insignificant in the long run, they don't GET IT, they don't get the power of spirituality, they are secularists and progressives, they "fucking love science" and are often technological masturbators, wanting to reap the benefits of a pipe dream (conquering the galaxies; curing cancer and dumb unrealistic and egotistical shit like that).</p>
<p>If the fucking babylonians and Nebuchad-fucking-nezzar and the Romans couldn't even beat God then what do these pathetic degenerated saps think they're going to achieve, they're not even a patch on these guys. These guys like to read Might is Right and Nietzsche (ironic because Nietzsche didn't know shit about the true history or teachings of paganism) but were they to come out of literary fantasy they'd be the first to get butchered under their "order" because they are the complete inverse of masculinity and might. If they haven't done anything with their lives now, they never will. It won't go anywhere, let them think they're achieving something or doing something sooo original.</p>
