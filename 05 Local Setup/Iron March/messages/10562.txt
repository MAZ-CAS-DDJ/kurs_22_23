<p>Hi there. Yeah it doesn't surprise me that there is a drive, despite what the blogs say there's only one successful event a year and thats November 5th in London. There's no ideology behind it though, just  a bunch of high angry morons talking about the reptillians and smashing up riot vans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Really the left is totally collapsing and anyone with radical thoughts on building anything is torn down. So naturally they begin to read elsewhere... Usually starting with more popular right wing thought like Common Filth for example (he's a right wing conservative christian in the states, but his videos on liberal degeneracy are funny as fuck, just try not to gag

<p>Also what do you know of the New British Union? They actually a bunch of live action roleplayers? I've been allocated a free ticket to their rally, but it's on the 19th also so I'm obviously gonna go to your shindig instead. One thing my history taught me is go straight to the top <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>There will be more from my area (Devon) I guarantee you, I wield respect among the extreme and informal and there's many who are disillusioned with being bitches for our old guard... I would be very surprised if I'm the only one, there's already 2 who're up for it. </p>

<p>Cheers for the contact mate, I have had a few emails back and forth with the official email but yet to get another reply so I will keep contact, and would be interested in hearing your experience and what National Action hopes to achieve short term.</p>

<p>Yep, bushcraft is top notch, you into fishing and stuff also? I think it'd be very handy for other members to do expeditions out into the countryside and learn some bits and bobs. Survival and foraging skills develop teams in a way second only to combat, in my opinion anyway.</p>
