<p>There seems to be a growing interest in the Boer Genocide in south africa, perhaps you could rally support for them? I bring this up not just for a publicity stunt you could use, but also I sympathize with the Boers, I'm not Dutch but I see those people as a perfect example of Germanic adaptability in any given environment... and ok I am sympathetic to the notion of pan-Germanic nationalism... </p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>
