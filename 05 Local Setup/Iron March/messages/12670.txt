<p>Heh, well I can see why even a Biblical book about the day of judgement might appeal to a fascist. What is it you like about the New Testament? I've always found it rather too 'peace and love', whereas the OT advocates violence in response to degeneracy. The Catholic OT also has absolute gems of (unintentional?) comedy like the Book of Tobit. Yeah, it'll take a little more to wake the American people up, but the Trump riots have at least got them thinking. Me too! I'm at the gym quite a bit, doing strength and a bit of cardio, but due to joint injuries can't (yet) do anything hardcore. What do you do besides lifting? Can you ski?</p>
<p>Colourful family, you have! That's a real shame, but it's good you have them on your side in some sense. Do you think your uncle at least will get involved if there's a strong chance of race war? The U.S. education system has sadly figured out the way to muffle the human mind's racialist tendencies, but that's nothing good propaganda can't fix. Hopefully the rest of your family will come around to your point of view in the end, as what they're really swayed by is power.</p>
<p>6'3? I had no idea I was talking to a giant! I'm 5'5, which is tallish over here for a girl, but I might as well be a midget in comparison.</p>
