<p>Ah, but here's the thing: much of Judaism's lore was borrowed from other sources, as it was with Christianity and Islam. For me, the Torah is a series of fables based on history, and we will never know for sure what really happened.</p>
<p>We do know, however, that the account of Avraham's life is accurate to that time period (since you mention Breshit). We will never prove whether he existed, or whether he did what he the Torah says he did, but we know his life was a typical one for that ime period, with no inconcistencies.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I do like von Hoffmeister; I've read most of his works. National Futurism is becoming icreasingly appealing, a good marraige of my nationalist, authortarian principles to my Jewish faith.</p>
