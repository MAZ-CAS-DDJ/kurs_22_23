<p>No, although i'm planning to join the KFA sometime. I'm not going to join the idiot communists (cpp-npafgas) or join the idiot pro-usa/liberal faggots either. I don't like either of them. One side wants spanishness and americanness to prevail, the other desiring communism. I might be socialist and DPRK/USSR sympathizer, but i do not believe in class war and the end of nations. One can still be an anti communist and be pro-USSR, as Slavros once said.</p>
