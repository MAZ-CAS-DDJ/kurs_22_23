			Pretty gnarly. I'm not into tattoos but I'd definitely give you a Sieg Heil on the street if I saw you. I look like Michael Douglas in Falling Down. Clean cut, but I'll still throw down with niggers. You look like you scrap a lot. You ever been to prison?

	I'm actually preparing for day three with the Anti racists.  Day one.I got clocked with a lock, day two I pounded some dumb asses fave in. And then got chased by a mob. So who knows what brings this to me in the third day of our little insignificant street battles.

	I've been to prison twice. Locked up over 20 times. Im currently out on bond.
