<p>Well my daughter's only 7 so it's not that bad YET, the worst they teach them is about different cultures more than there own but I've got plenty of bitesized and fun kids books and fables she knows pretty well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm just honest with her, I tell her niggers can't be trusted and that teachers will tell her off if she uses those words because they favour them over her because the world's a weird place and she'll understand it more when she gets older.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whenever she has homework or doesn't get something that was taught her in school she comes to me and I make sure she gets it; she's become the best in her class at maths because of the short cuts and tricks I've shown and told her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've always taught my daughter to think before accepting something someone says; if it doesn't feel right or make sense then question it. I just send her to school so she doesn't end up a social retard. I've never thought highly of schools and hated it myself; I've just told her that school days are the least important days of her life. I keep her occupied with activities outside of school, swimming's good enough and I let her shoot my bb guns and help me out when I'm welding or taking apart a radio.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm expecting it to get harder as she gets older but I've nipped a lot of things in the bud already.</p>
