<p>Basically whatever GD will be comfortable giving us, we're essentially going to provide an international news outlet in english for whatever they want out there, like their events, activism, issues with police, state or opponents, mass events, calls for donations and so on. So basically any time there's a lecture that can be covered, an event announced in advance and then a report provided about it after it happened, maybe covered of member training - literally news covering the life of the movement, as much of it as they are willing to share with/without pictures depending on what is being covered.</p>
