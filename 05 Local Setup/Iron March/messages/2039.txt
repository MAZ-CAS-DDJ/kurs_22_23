<p>"Politics is much worse here, you have to use a million pesos just to persuade people to vote for you, mainly because you have to give them money."</p>
<p>But later you will be repaid with state money.... same shit everywhere..</p>
<p>"Reproducing is not bad, as long as the offspring have quality, and one has the resources to do so, unless the state supports big families."</p>
<p>The state will have to support only big families...</p>
<p>"BTW, what do you think of immigrants who work hard and assimiliate in your society? (he is black/asian/whatever, but he speaks Bulgarian, and so on, basically Bulgarianized)"</p>
<p>Well right now we have a high unemployment rate and i dont see to import emigrants but if the things are good and say we have a upward economy and need a work force in short therms they may have come some foreigners but like a contractors come here ,work, do their job, get the fuck out of here... in long therm automatization is good alternative...</p>
<p>And now to answer to your question if some Cameroon ape come in your town learn you language and start poking your womens how do you feel? You grandfathers die in wars to ensure you living space and now some ugly coon came and bread your air ?? I dont know im feel very angry about this and even if im not well when he is alone ok but when they came in thousands, tens of thousands they never will learn your language never adopt your culture even the opposite they will want you to adopt their culture and made the fuckers feel home.. So that is my answer NO fuck emigrants here is not USA or Africa...</p>
