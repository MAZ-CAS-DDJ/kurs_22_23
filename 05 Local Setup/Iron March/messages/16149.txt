	Nice. I don't like visiting the barber too often so mine gets a bit long sometimes - around about a 2 but when I get it cut I usually get a 0 without guard faded to make a half or 1 near the top. Keep the top long enough to have some hair. You might've seen my pic actually - but the one I posted was after not having a cut for about 6-8 weeks.
