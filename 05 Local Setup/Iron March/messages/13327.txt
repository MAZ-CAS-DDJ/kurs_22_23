	It's gonna take a while do go through this huge list and find sources for everything.
</p>

<p>
	Just wanted to let you know I added support for submitting organizations.
</p>

<p>
	So if there are registered NGOs etc. that you want to submit to the site you can do that now.
</p>

<p>
	You can also add relationships to people for every organization under the "affiliations" section.
</p>

<p>
	Cheers
