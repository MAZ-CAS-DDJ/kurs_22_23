<p>In reality, it's much preferable to have a force of enlisted who can self-organize and have utilities of leadership within the smallest units. This is why I'm a fan of the US Marine Corps. The point is, the brunt of the six years training an officer gets is doing the same thing as that of a soldier: five years are dedicated to basic service. Officer must be a soldier first. The rest that it actually literally takes to become an officer is best employing the skills learned in these five years, plus of course a college degree somewhere. It will take much more than your average joe to pass the officer's trials, which should be very traditional/ritualistic but extremely rigorous and academic as well. However the only officer's training is the year's seclusion from all civilian life. It's only <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>one year</em></span>, a difficult year of course, with a lot of underpinnings or difficulties to get there, much less pass, but purely time wise it isn't that long. And once again, if that one year is too much a sacrifice, then we probably don't need your kind in the officer corps. The job of all this is to dissuade not persuade people from joining the military, so that only the most bold and daring will ever make it.</p>
<p>Like I said, there's plenty of thought I put into this <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>Civilian team of administrators appointed by the Congress. I'm not sure how exactly the responsibilities will be distributed, but there will definitely be civilians organizing the state affairs of the military. These however will not be granted the task of promoting or demoting high officers, this will fall on the highest council of the nation itself.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="190" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Ah, the secret police! Now this sounds interesting. I assume they would be in charge of making sure that citizens are not abusing their position for private gain and that unrest is not being fomented among the general population. Is this correct? Would they have any special powers beyond your regular police or would they just be plain-clothed policemen with additional training?<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I'm not quite sure about these either. I'm thinking now they will only be spies tasked with delivering information to the police, who would THEN be tasked with resolving whatever issue, and will in fact be the only centralized form of law enforcement since I believe legal matters should be handled strictly locally. Don't get me wrong, there would be intercommunication between regions to effectively deal with inter-state crime, but centralization in this respect breeds corruption of the highest order.</p>
<p>Secret police should work as a part of the police, which are part of the municipal government, therefore have autonomy in the central government, (elected by the populace directly) however since they're a centralized utility they should be organized by one department of the centralized government. Which one? I'm not sure, since all of them have more or less equal power.</p>
