<p>in college here, a Serbian woman was in my class, and whenever something about homosexuality was talked about she so spoke loudly against it, Â  I was very surprised to be honest, she was mostly right wing but i'm not sure to what extent, on the other hand there was a hot Italian chick that was a complete left wing faggot, weird huh?</p>
