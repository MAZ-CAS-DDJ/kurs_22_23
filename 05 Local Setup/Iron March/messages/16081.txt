	Messaging me asking how to not behave like an autist probably wasn't the correct first step.

	I didn't need to integrate because I was on the same page as Ironmarch i signed up. You don't need to <em>appeal</em> to anybody, what the fuck man. Just act normal. If you behave like a socially awkward tist, somebody will tell you so. If you say something retarded, somebody will tell you that you're a retard. That's how life works, and it's how you grow and stop being a retard- by taking shit people give you on the chin instead of having a sperg over it.

	Thing is, everything you're talking about has already been discussed to death years ago. IM doesn't exist to have intellectual circlejerks over ideological points. We've already come to a consensus and have our worldview layed out in pretty good detail in our recommended reading lists. If you don't want to sound like an imbecile, <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/5131-registration-introduction-guidelines-up-to-date-as-of-020816/" rel="">ACTUALLY READ THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION MATERIALS</a>- I'd start with the next leap and open letter to the white man.
