<p>Heh, guess the Jews have been stealing since the beginning of time. I certainly believe that's a plausible way of getting to so unusual a belief system as absolute monotheism, but I'm unsure as to how that fits in with other gods. Do you believe gods are the invention of man, or that the gods are just unreliable? Would certainly explain the Greek ones. Absolutely! It's dividing over small issues that never gets the big ones solved. We can save squabbling over state religion for when we have states. She is, and while I certainly respect the SSPX, they share a holy book with the kikes, so unless there's a logical reason for that, I'm steering clear. The only Christianity that currently appeals is Positive Christianity, and that's gateway paganism.</p>

Still cool, though! Do you visit them ever? I guess one language at a time, and standard German would be a good base for any later re-learning of your ancestral dialect. My family also speaks one, completely incomprehensible to those Piefkes up in Prussia. Then again, their cities aren't German anymore, so who knows how much of their 'own' language they understand.</p>

Definitely agree with you about folk traditions, especially ones consisting of appeasing the little green men with offerings and stuff. Will definitely have to check that book out. *sigh* Bless the US. Did you hear some museum did an experiment with decaying cheeses, and the one which stayed in perfect shape even after years was Kraft's?</p>

With the way school has been, I've barely covered the essentials of fascist theory, but once I'm through that reading list, I'll start on what you've recommended. When did you get interested in paganism?</p>
