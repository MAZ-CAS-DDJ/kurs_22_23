<p>The left stopped being a "worker's party" long ago, modern leftists are all rich kids who believe in cultural Marxist propaganda and haven't worked a day in their life, they are offended by everything and feel the need to be pandered to because they cry when something in the world isn't like they want it to be. The good thing is that most honest workers are getting disillusioned by the SJW crap and lean more towards the right now.</p>

<p>Germany is... well, economically we're strong, but the high taxes can be stifling and we have tons of regulations so founding your own company has a LOT of bureaucracy involved, and of course the taxes. There are some very beautiful regions, and the traditional culture of Germany is great, but the mainstream is very left and that makes everything shit. Politics are utter shit, most young people have degenerate views (a lot of weed smokers, and people who do bullshit like open relationships and all that), and the worst thing is how foreigner-filled the major cities are. Taking the public transportation in my city, I mostly hear Turkish or other middle eastern languages when people talk on the phone. And with the refugee crisis, it's only going to get worse.</p>

<p>Best region to be in is probably Bavaria, when I go on a holiday within my own country I almost always choose Bavaria because I love the dialect they speak, I love the food and the beer, and they're the most conservative state in the country. Bavaria = best Germany, can recommend it.</p>

<p>If you ever do decide to move to Germany, it's better to wait anyway until the full consequences of the massed immigration of "refugees" (half of which are from safe countries like Morocco and just want to leech our welfare) show their effect. I'm pretty sure it will impact our economy, because the government is spending billions on the "refugees". Merkel's mismanagement of the situation is a total trainwreck.</p>

<p>Also, a confession: when I checked out chalga on youtube, I thought some of the songs were kinda catchy. The worst part is the whole culture surrounding it, with its "fuck bitches get money" philosophy.</p>
