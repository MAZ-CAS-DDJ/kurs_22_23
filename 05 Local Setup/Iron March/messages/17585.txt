	Hey there,<br />
	I was very briefly involved with AV during Starman's time as leader. I am a propagandist who has made stuff for several different groups, including Atomwaffen, Silver Legion, and some local things in the new england area. I am interested in continuing to make stuff for AV, but the reason I left was the general cucked stance of the group, and the aversion to swastikas, hitler, national socialism, and fascism. I'd love to get back in with you guys and show you some of the things I've been working on in the way of AV propaganda. If you're interested, feel free to message me here or on discord. My username there is Kai #3007
