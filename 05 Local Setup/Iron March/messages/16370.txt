	Hey, I saw your post in the "Post your flags thread".<br /><br />
	If you want custom flags I'd recommend ultrasshop.com which is where among others SKYDAS and <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> get some of their stuff made.<br />
	They make good quality flags at very affordable costs and they have a policy basically saying "If you want something with Che Guevara on it, sod off", most products are made in Poland while some are made in China, it usually says at the bottom of the product page.<br /><br />
	I don't know the quality of the AliExpress flags compared to these, but I'd personally rather buy from a Polish company that doesn't mind making NS products than to buy from China.<br />
	They also make other custom products like t-shirts, stickers, scarves, jackets etc<br /><br /><img alt="dsc05459_8240_41.jpg" class="ipsImage" height="309" src="http://se.ultrasshop.com/gal/41/dsc05459_8240_41.jpg" width="464" /><br /><br /><img alt="0833_5731_40.jpg" class="ipsImage" height="284" src="http://se.ultrasshop.com/gal/40/0833_5731_40.jpg" width="428" /></p>
