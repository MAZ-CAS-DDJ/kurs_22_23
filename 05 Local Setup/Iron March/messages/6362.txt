<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">One thing you must understand, I had only spent a short portion of my childhood in the early 90s (birth to 6) living just outside of Zagreb, in a fairly culturally rich but "protected" community with my parents and extended family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">Since then, I have been living abroad, having only returned to Croatia twice for short holidays.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">Long story short - most of my "experience" about the old Yugoslavia comes from anecdotal "history" lessons from my parents and grandparents who may have been biased or swayed quite substantially in favor of one ideology over another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">My paternal grandmother was a highly-benefited communist party member for the majority of her working life and loved Tito like a grandfather, while my parents and my entire mother's side especially were staunch Croatian patriots who unfortunately had to keep "under the radar" a bit and their public opinions to themselves.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">In my own experience, the area around Zagreb, was largely shielded from the very real threat of "Serbianiazation" as you so call it - certainly plaguing other areas of western and central-southern Croatia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">Even the war, when it broke out, was mostly focused on those said areas and occasionally we would get air-raid sirens for bombing threats to the city of Zagreb - but that was it - the war never actually came anywhere near our town directly and caused no direct damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">My father having served two tours of that war, the family was very well aware of the intricacies of the "battles" and was kept informed quite well during the entire period '91 till '96 until the majority of the unrest was settled.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">Politically, as we lived in a cultural and geographical extension of the Croatian capital, the effect of Serbian relations/pressures/politics was fairly minimal, but present nonetheless - certainly to a degree that it was felt by those in working class (or higher) families, however not to any dramatic lifestyle altering extents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">Again, far from what I'd heard other areas were experiencing - where the after-effects of consistent and long-term (forced) Serbianiazation can still be seen in some Croatian towns along the Serbian/Bosnian borders to this day.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">Also, not sure I would be using the word "republics" and "under Yugoslavia" in the one sentence - that is anachronistically incorrect, as they were only states between 50s and 90s (as independent as you wish to believe - some, like Croatia, certainly more than others)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">As I have no formal political/social science education, rather only a keen interest in history and social ideologies, I don't think I would be the right person to ask for comparisons between Yugoslav and Brazilian situations - certainly because I have very little knowledge of the latter.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">And finally, despite there being many short-term benefits to having a unified Yugoslavian state (especially during the Cold war), in the long run I do think each Republic should remain on its own. I do not believe I am informed enough yet of the situations in Kosovo and Vojvodina to argue whether their separations (highly-possible near-future for the latter) were a justifiably good idea, however time will tell.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">What most certainly must happen, is for an entire generation of "mixed"-ideological old-timers that are still in charge of politics in both Croatia and Bosnia to either die off or move on and allow more modern and republic-focused members to take over (i.e. Croatians with Croatian nationalism in mind having majority seats in the Sabor, as opposed to ex-Yugo patriots and Communist/Serb-influenced outsiders, as is currently still the case.)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">I hope this answers some questions and helps you with your project.</span></p>
