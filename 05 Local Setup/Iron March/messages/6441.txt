<p>You wait for the photos to still come out. We were co-hosting with another group (uncensored male and gf photographer) and they have been pretty PC in terms of what they chose to show. we saluted at parlainment and cable street, and this one kid holding a celtic cross flag climbed the statue of mandella and picked up the vase at his feet and smashed it in front of like, 2000 tourists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Problem with the footage though is they literally ran out of internet and have literally had to mail me the usb sticks with all the footage they got - so we have had to keep it mostly hush. really irritating.</p>

<p>the Huffpo article was gold, but basically vindicated what we have been trying to say about the image problem. How long have right wingers been trying to educate the media on how they think they are supposed to be portrayed? in our case it just writes itself. it made us look like cool, serious shit as ooposed to basement dwellers, sociopaths, impotent losers, political failiures, etc.</p>

<p>For my own part it has been good fortune - we all really needed eachother to make this work, i wouldn't normally be able to have any kind of impact, and we have been really lucky - I have to emphasise we basically prevented a tradyouth embarassment equivilant in the UK. Generation Identity UK would have been shit, run out of the Traditional Britain group, which is autism.</p>

<p>There is the new article today where they intereviewed our organiser, great title, but a little lame. Gerry gable has expressed concern about presece on unis - and I have to say many have answered our appeal to post stickers at unis so maybe he is right. I posted 3 different packets heading to Newcastle, Exeter, and somewhere else. Rockerz88 has vowed to hit loads of Unis, there is like 5 where he lives and he will hit manchester too, he has been given like, 100-150 stickers. Marmiteman also contacted us today wanting to do something which is also good news.</p>

<p>This is very good news. Any photos or information you want published, Id be happy to push it on the twitter. Its not the same as on-the-ground work but it might gain more people willing to pitch in. The twitter is gaining alot of attention, Jews trying to ban it &amp; multiple hack attempts which have failed.</p>

<p>What was the vase by Mandelas statue? Any plans for the White Man March?</p>
