<p>As a friendly correction, the expression is "toe the line" not "tow the line", as in placing one's toes along a line at the beginning of a race.</p>
<p>I am taking a 1st year psych class now and the prof said a bunch of crap about poverty explaining racial differences in intelligence and he mentioned Shockley only to dismiss him. He also praised Leon Kamin and showed us slides which stated that Nazi Germany had as part of their eugenics program the extermination of Catholics. It was all so absurd but I didn't say anything except to point out that the Nazis didn't think much of IQ tests since Ashkenazi Jews scored higher than gentile Germans.</p>
