	We meet up and have drinks, nice social outings. Stickering and banner drops have all been brought up (nothing illegal ever goes on so that's all good for me as a student <img alt=":nameit:" data-emoticon="" src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/fascistballs_checkit.png" title=":nameit:" />)

	At a meet-up you'll be able to talk to more about it with the branch leader. All you'll be doing is discussing politics and yourself, as well as any questions you might have.

	As for the convention, I've never been before but apparently it's a chance to meet new people and get a more general sense of <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>. :)
