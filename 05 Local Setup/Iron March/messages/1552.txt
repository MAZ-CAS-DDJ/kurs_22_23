<p>Nice video. I have read about this topic.</p>
<p>I do not believe in "aliens." Modern humans were not genetically engineered. The Anunnaki could not have had ofspring with Earth women if they were from space. Could they have been Aryans that had children with early (sub)humans? Its possible. If the Anunnaki exist/ed they were a different race of humans that evolved on this Earth. They may have interbred with inferior humans created modern Europeans. I do think their was a superior Hyperborean race that interbred with inferior humans creating modern Europeans.</p>
<p>The cradle of civilization was Aryan and all modern civilizations with a written language descend from it. Sumeria, India, Egypt ect were all White. China, Japan ect on the otherhand were not White but the sead of civilization was planted by ancient Aryans.</p>
<p>Will something happen later in 2012? I doubt it. Niberu may exist, I am agnostic on it. </p>
<p>These mythical stories for the most part I do not take seriously. For the most part they are fiction.</p>
