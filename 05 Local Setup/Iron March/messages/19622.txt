			Nope. We only learned about that quote which says something like: 1000 years old mariage with Hungary went wrong, we must dissolve.

			I like idea of stronger roots with Hungary. In economic union or military aliance most. Although i wouldn't like being in common state with your people. But don't worry, i don't even want to live in same state with Czechs (after Moravians our closest brothers in language similiarities)

	We need some kind of an alliance that's for sure; our states are too small and weak in themselves to be able to withstand the influences of outer powers. It would be so great to see V4 rising... but for now, our priority should be to fight against Chauvinism between our people and think about a future in which we are brothers again.
