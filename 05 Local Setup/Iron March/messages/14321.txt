	Thanks for the reply, didn't know that you'd get back to us.

	Our tactics are basically what we call the Stickercaust (if you want to see some of our work, Daily Stormer did an article on us a few times), which is where we hit spots with flyers designed to trigger SJW types and get the most attention. Usually colleges. The point of this is to cause fear, essentially. When stickers show up in the middle of the night, people don't know how many Nazis they have in their area, taking classes with them, riding the bus with them, living next to them, etc.

	Usually we have people directed to this website and we'll recruit them off of here. But if you want an email, i could give you mine. I'm no longer overseeing AW because our leader came back from basic training in the military, but he gave me permission to oversee the link between AW and <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>. But if i send you my email, please screen the people you send my way a bit before giving them the email. We've had a few hackers/White knight faggots try and steal the IPs of our members.

	If you want to speak to the head hancho, he's on here as well. Screenname: Odin the Wanderer. Shoot him a message if you want, and i'll be waiting to hear back from you myself as well.
