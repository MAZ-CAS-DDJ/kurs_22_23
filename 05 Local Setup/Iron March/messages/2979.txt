<p>-I <em>do</em> hate kikes. You are simply a scourge upon the earth.</p>
<p>-I am of the view that no matter how savage, barbarous and unintelligent a person is they can be tamed. Negroes can be tamed. Abbos can be tamed. Indians can be tamed. Whites can be tamed.</p>
<p>I see no reason to annihilate any of these races - it is simply immoral to kill a person who only needs a proper education to become at the very least not-destructive - I cannot imagine the twisted minds of those who advocate genocide against any non-jewish race.</p>
<p><em>Jews</em> however, no matter what you do to them simply oppress and destroy - usually financially - as if we goyim are their personal playthings. Every society they have been part of have rejected and destroyed them, it is easy to see their lies. Google "pogrom" see what happens when yids and goyim mix.</p>
<p>-Jews have blood on their hands, the blood of the righteous.</p>
<p>-Kikes always find a way to cheat and steal</p>
<p>-Kikes are responisble for liberalism, communism, usury, the current economic crisis and feminism</p>
<p>-Kikes never stop whining about anything</p>
<p>-Kikes are trying to unite the world as one nation, under finance</p>
<p>-Kikes lie incessently, jewish made swastika graffiti reported as 'hate crimes' is very common</p>
<p>-Circumcision is fucking weird</p>
