	In my reenacting group to a point but not Fascist or NS. They're more basic conservative and Libertarians.

	I belong to a small group of Fascists and National Socialists of Polish blood (only two of us are in the States, the rest are in Poland). We aren't LARPy like some NS groups in that we aren't preparing for Rahowa or doing qusi illegal activity. We're more interested in community, camping, physical fitness, military service, and whatnot; pretty much living the Fascist lifestyle. The US members live in PA and NJ.

	I have a few questions to get to know you some. Tell me a bit about yourself. I see you've only been a member here for a week or so...what brought you here? What's your red pilling story?
