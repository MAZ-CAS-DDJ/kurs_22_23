<p>Yeah, I'm Slovene, I live in the capital Ljubljana, nice to hear that you have Croat roots. Did your father teach you any Croat words? <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> I'm fluent in Croatian, I've been there many times and I have good knowledge of their culture and history. It's a great country, I feel at home in every Central European country anyway, we have so much common history and culture. If you want to know anything about the homeland of your ancestors, just ask me. It's a nice heritage to have, Croats are a pro-fascist nation <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>You're American "for now"? Do you plan to move to Europe?</p>
