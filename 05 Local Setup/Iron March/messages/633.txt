<p>I made a thread regarding what I thought to be the ideal political State and I suppose it came across as some like Starship Troopers. The governmental system in that novel, however, is pretty different than the one I proposed so I think it was just used a personal insult. As I said, it never was mental to be a plan of government or any kind of attainable thing, just a political idealization.</p>
