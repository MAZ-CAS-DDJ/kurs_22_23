	I wouldn't say Protestantism is entirely bad I do admire Martin Luther and the initial rebellion against the Catholic church as it had become entirely degenerate. I do obviously dislike modern Protestantism.

	What are you exactly I was under the impression that the way you defend the one true god in debates that you were of devout faith. And since you're Hungarian I just assumed you were Catholic.

	There's nothing wrong with science , science is legitimate for how we interpret the world. You seem to equate all science with atheism and that simply isn't the case.

	Also I dislike the term Paganism , for one you can't have a Roman term apply for every religion , as well as the modern taint of the word. I prefer using Ancient Religions or Indigenous European Religions, instead. To distance myself from the LARPers and the modern faggotry that goes on with (((Paganism))).

	Yes in highschool I tried to be more devout Christian I got into listening to medieval chants , but there was always that doubt in my mind , because at the same time I was reading all about Hitler and the Aryan race and Atlantis etc. So I've always been conflicted between my Nazi beliefs and my general doubt of the religion itself. Also I got into biblical archaeology and I found out most of the Old testament is a false history,it is a Jewish mythology more of a political metaphor for the ancient Israelites.

	Christ we can obviously see was influenced by many different types of Ancient religions from India to Zoroastrianism to Egypt to Greek deities etc.Â
