	Hey Xav, don't know if you'll appreciate this or not but apparently there is a short film (a little over 28 minutes) adaptation of Patriotism by Mishima. Let me know what you think. PS Also, let me know if you think I should post it under general videos and if you think it would get any likes? Also, the sex scene is kind of weird tbh but I guess you will see. Overall it is not a bad little film. Let me know what you think.
