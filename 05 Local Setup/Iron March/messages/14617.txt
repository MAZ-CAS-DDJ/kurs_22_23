	Yea, giving too much info is not required. Just mention that you are a refugee from Stormfront and you are willing to learn ( we all do, afterall ). That would be a good for start - rest would be reading and fammiliarising yourself with the board - it may be confusing at first but it is very easy :) Also don't hesitate to contact the other Brits :)
