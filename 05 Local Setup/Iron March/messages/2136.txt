<p>You sound very interesting.</p>
<p>Does your group only follow nationalism or does it have an idea of how it would want a government to function?</p>
<p>I like Ã‰tat, he seems a good man.</p>
<p>But I must warn you that I don't believe Fascism will never have acceptance (At least in Europe there are more nationalistic movements these days). I believe Fascism is the inevitable reaction to liberal Democracy and liberal Capitalism that will decay society.</p>
<p>I also worry that this kind of Capitalism will create Communists who will take over. And Communists have their voices heard in politics more today.</p>
<p>However, I think there is a difference between Communism and some Socialism. Although I am still not a supporter of Leninism or Marxism.</p>
