	There is no Christian race because thats a belief system, not a race. So you support the diluting of our European spirit and soul? No identity but a Christian one will result in racial destruction an when the religion falls (and all authority figures and dogma's do, which is already happening in the past 200 years) then people will easily by controlled by unelected elite since identity is the basis of politics. Again how do you reconcile this?
