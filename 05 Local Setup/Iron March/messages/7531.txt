<p>Hello. I have being on this website for only a short amount of time, a few days, though about a year ago I created an account "EngliscNationalist" but that was inactive.</p>
<p>Sure I will be friends, though I think it's likely we will both end up banned. These admins have a serious nerve, as do his closest circle jerkers.<br />And yes Nationalism is pretty much screwed because of the extreme sectarianism and divide among all nationalist groups.</p>
