<p>I was there for five years, it was pretty nice. Even though I was a bit of a loner, didn't really get the Asian culture. I spent a lot of time in the jungle. Where did you go when you were there?</p>

<p>Back in the days before refridgeration I'd think that pepper would be pretty important. I wouldn't want to eat bad meat without anything to hide it either!</p>

<p>Sure, but wait a little while to share it, I don't want to get in more trouble than I am already for writing it! <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_cool.png" alt="B)" /></p>

<p>My day was ok, I stayed up past 3 writing another essay, drank too much coffee and took an exam. Then I went to the gym for some reason (never skip!) and passed out for six hours when I got home.</p>
<p>Tell me about yours!</p>
