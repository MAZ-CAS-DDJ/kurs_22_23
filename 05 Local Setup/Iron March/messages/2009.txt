Consider that they are trying to keep both Liberalism (South korea) and Communism (PRC) on the one hand. The Juche idea means total economical independence, so no Communist/Capitalist economy shall drag them to the cesspool, and their Songun Policy, which means that the revolution is led by the army. Maybe they have their flaws, but so do other states. The best thing in the DPRK is that they still have the traditionalism in their culture. Compared to South Korea. </p></div></blockquote>
<p>Yes im agreed with that but in practic their have some discrepancy between theory and act.. South Korea is not so bad i mean they have no imigrant policy and that is awesome in "modern globalized world" but like a way of living they are fucked and degenerated but i think that their problems will end when 2 countries unite and make some compromises in both ideological and economy doctrine..  At least from my point of view the socialism will prevail over a spiritles democratic regime which is only empty shell. When the idealists have government support , tribune, and their word is hear Koreans will understand what is best for them..  not like other countries when you is just"voice in the desert"... </p>
<p>I bet that you dont understand me sorry for that just Bulgarian is not 100% overlap with English and there have some sentences that not only sound different but the whole point is lost...</p>
<p>P.S</p>
<p>Im work in day time but im going to work very early and that is why i write you now ..</p>
<p>BTW where you from?</p>
