<p>I'm also keen on seeing what the League of Rights has to say, they seem like a pretty interesting group from what I've read about them. </p>

<p>I was looking forward to getting to the centenary dawn service this year, but I'll be on a fishing boat at 6am on the day, so I won't be able to get to a memorial. Hopefully if I have a good session on the water I can celebrate with a beer or two at the RSL.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>AusAction's a good idea, and Kalash will definitely be able to cook up something good for us. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And yeah, nationalists wanting to leave their nation is an odd one to me, I can't understand it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But anyway, I've got some reading material for this weekend so I should have a couple of interesting posts to make when I get back from the beach sometime early next week. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Take it easy </p>
