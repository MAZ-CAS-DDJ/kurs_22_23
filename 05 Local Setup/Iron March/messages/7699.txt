<p>Freemasons were just schmucks who utilized legitimate traditional symbolism of masonry but utilized it without really understanding what it is and thus perverted its meaning entirely, they were formed far too late in the involutionary process to wield those symbols and meanings as they were meant to be used and instead used them however they could and for whatever purpose, they naturally appropriated Knights Templar because the symbolic meanings are related and date back tying those elements together, but again, they couldn't possibly use them in their true intended fashion.</p>

<p>Evola wrote a separate work on Freemasonry and criticized it for those very reasons and supported their destruction while being of good opinion of Knights Templar.</p>
