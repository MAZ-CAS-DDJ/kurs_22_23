<p>Thanks for the offer. I can say that I can manage the time to moderate, however I'd probably need some time to get adjusted to how things work as a mod. As for skype, I don't use skype that often, I never had need for it until now, but if need be, I will, if I can. Thing is, my days usually revolve around spending a lot of time during classes and in the library, and my classes for this year and the next may prevent me from spending time around the forum for more than 10 minutes, for two days at most, of course, but I will try to do my best to be active.</p>
<p>If this sounds reasonable, I'd be happy to help.</p>
