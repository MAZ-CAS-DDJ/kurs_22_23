<p>Well, I for one would rather keep the electoral college because without it, the President would be elected to closely by the people. The electoral college allows for some distance so people (as stupid as they get) won't think they have the sole voting privilege over the government. Just imagine if we didn't have the electoral college for last year's election. People would have been rioting on the streets.  </p>
<p>In my opinion, I don't think people have the enlightened capability to bring about a Fascist government. Once society degenerates as far as ours has, people will be only looking out for themselves and vote in any socialist demagogue that will give them their quick fix of the privileged's property. In my opinion, taking a revolutionary stance for family, morality, and traditional values such as the fascists did during the 1930's seems the more promising route. However, idiots now a days think they have licence to do what makes them feel good and should not have to answer to authority. This is really the challenge we are facing, and it's a difficult one.</p>
<p>If I may ask, what state are you from?</p>
