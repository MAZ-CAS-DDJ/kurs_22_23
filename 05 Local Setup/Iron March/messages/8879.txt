<p>This is one of my favourite eposodes of that show, y'know, if you were in the mood to watch.</p>

<p>Me and the idiot used to watch shows together online (long distance), we'd pick a show, and then on skype we'd get the play button ready, and I'd count down 3, 2, 1, so we pressed play at the same time, so we were up to the same part and we would feel closer, and we'd both cuddle a pillow. Do you think that's sweet or stupid? <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>Another question, what kind stuff would you be looking at if I wasn't here?</p>
