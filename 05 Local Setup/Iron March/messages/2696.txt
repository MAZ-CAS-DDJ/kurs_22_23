<p>My proposal is to commit infractions, like turning over your front lawn for a garden, to gain exposer, then using the food/sales to help your community. Its posititve action in a manner that forces attention.</p>
<p>Being Active Duty, I understand you can't take this risk just yet. Still, coordinated, attention-grabbing, and <em>positive</em> action is necessary. We'll never get anywhere by writing manifestoes or platforms alone, we need to follow the examples of community service and, to some extent, civil disobedience to make our point and gain support.</p>
