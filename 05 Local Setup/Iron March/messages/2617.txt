<p>Holy shit, it's refreshing to meet a Ukrainian of fascist orientations that isn't Russophilic; I constantly run into the Russophile types who deem themselves equal to their frosted neighbors. I've always personally believed the Ukraine to be separate from Russia(for very obvious reasons..I don't even see how you can even call the Western parts of the Ukraine, Russian.) &amp; personally held Russia to be one of the biggest problems of Europa. Needs to be shrunk. That may be my Germanic blood screaming out at me - but it's how I feel.</p>
