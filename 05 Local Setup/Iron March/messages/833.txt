<p>The interview with Ms Speranskaja was particularly encouraging, given her declared adherence to Revolutionary Conservatism. I am left with one question, though: why is it that they have this set of ideas sometimes, and yet, as <em>Foundations of Geopolitics</em> (the geopolitical ideas of which seem to be unique to that particular book) shows, a radically different set other times?</p>
<p>Essentially, in both cases they advocate the creation of international power blocs of nationalist groups, but on the internet they have several all around the world, of a decidedly multinational nature; in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#Content" rel="external nofollow"><em>Foundations</em></a>, on the other hand, they have only a very few, which are more like empires as they are run by specific countries (for example, all of Central and Western Europe is run by Germany, and the "Atlantic" nations are decidedly screwed because the only movements promoted there will break up the countries, making them more prone to Eurasian domination.</p>
<p>Also, are you going to change your ideology to National Bolshevism?</p>
