<p>Your posts are fucking phenomenal. Absolutely great. I am a big fan.</p>
<p>Do you blog or anything?</p>
<p>I do not think that I am as hardline as many on the site about racial issues, but I am certainly race conscious, but more than anything, I am very much interested into achieving a great cultural society.</p>
<p>This is particualrly why I have a mass vehemence against sexual deviants, drug addicts and Traitorous Liberals, and it shows.</p>
<p>I am curious... What do you think of us whites who, by twists of fate, end up in Asia or wherever? Who just have been ended up with lots of close friendships and brotherhood with non-whites? I have a lot to say abotu it and want to hear your thoughts.</p>
<p>really good work and keep posting. Thanks.</p>

<p> Also, that being said, I'm of the opinion that a race's natural culture comes from the natural, in-grained tendencies of the people themselves. That might be why so many races just fail to thrive. They aren't meant for this type of life - native Americans are meant to be nomads living in smaller tribal societies.</p>

<p>North American Indians, Inuits, and your theory about Koreans aren't really dumb people like some races are (Aborigines and Sub-saharan Africans, IMO). They just aren't meant for this type of society, so they fail to thrive in it. I can't really put it into articulate terms right now (been up a long time), but I hope you get what I'm trying to say.</p>
