<p>My workplace is my only refuge, my boss is more like a grandfather, he is nothing short of an aristocrat and he is a decorated soldier.  We understand each other completely, I don't need to mince words with him and I always say what I think. I told him about the hope I have for the future, the feeling of resolution as I finish school and prepare to leave for foreign lands, about you as well. It's like a spell has lifted the desperation that used to pervade my existence, and that I'm prepared for a new future. </p>

<p>The poem is rather simple and straight from my head, I am staying at a friend's house and it describes the sights and emotions I experienced on his balcony while watching the sun set. A beautiful park can be seen from there. It is addressed to you because it was you I was thinking of in that moment.</p>

<p>You have apple trees? I went apple picking last summer and it was so much fun!</p>

<p>You've seen my axe in the riots thread, I have a bit of firewood in my father's backyard I use for practice. What a satisfying bit of action, it can be as serene or as violent as needed!</p>
