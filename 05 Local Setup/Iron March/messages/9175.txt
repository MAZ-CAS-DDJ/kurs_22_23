<p>Sorry didn't get back on this sooner, was out of the country.</p>

<p>He is basically talking about stuff that is extremely pedestrian, basic and some places out of date and I have no idea why he thinks anyone needs a .pdf to tell them about it. Most of the stuff in there is copied and pasted from another source. And some of those things are plain wrong in the first place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Example of his retardation:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-He rides Truecrypts dick but Truecrpyt has NEVER been trusted by infosec people as they put backdoors and ad's in their software that even their download host at <a href="http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/" rel="external nofollow">http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/</a>lists a gigantic red WARNING at the top of the page. Some other stuff on truecrypt he forgot to mention: </p>

<p>-He suggests getting your anti-virus by downloading pirated anti-virus through torrents. Holy shit. So basically he's suggesting downloading an anti-virus through literally the most virus/malware ridden medium that exists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-He suggests "norton password generator" for coming up with your "encryption password".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-He seems to confuse a lot of stuff (for some reasons believes that Malware is only written for Windows and Mac) and puts importance on things that are more of a waste of time. A good example is his little MAC Address write up that lasts 3 fucking pages. With private to public routing and SNAT/DNAT being pretty much standard everywhere (anywhere a router is used over a direct line) MAC address' don't matter. And due to the fact that changing a MAC address is as easy as hopping into a control panel, it's never used in court cases (you can change it to whatever as long as it doesn't conflict with anything on the local network so you can literally have the same MAC as the White House if you want) therefore I don't understand why he stresses changing it. </p>

<p>I'll look through it some more later.</p>
