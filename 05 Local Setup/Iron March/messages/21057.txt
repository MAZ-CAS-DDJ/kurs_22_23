	I´m not against concept of Czechoslovakia, in fact i like even bigger concepts like Intermarium(if it would be really independent). I even thinked about restoring Hungary(Uhorsko version) like federation of Slovakia, Hungary(Magyar version), Romania(should include Moldavia too) and Croatia. I only dislike how was Czechoslovakia working in history(both first and second republics).

	About interwar era Czechoslovakia: It was called Czechoslovakia, but Slovakia was underdeveloped in compare to Czech part too much, that we were more like colony, not coreland(this one i propably translatd bad)(not even mentioning carpathian ruthenia that was shithole compared to even Slovakia). All industry and stuff were being build in Czech parts, because of that many Slovaks and Rusins propably too migrated to CP. Slovaks wasnt having any real autonomy. State haven´t accepted Czech or Slovak nationality, only Czechoslovakian. Czech teachers were sent to teach in Slovakia. Primary language in schools was Czechoslovakian. We were in danger of being Czechized. There were far more minuses of course.

	About second Czechoslovakia: Communist state that was federation only in name. Slovak language was officialy only a dialect of czechoslovak language. Who claimed Slovak nationality was in danger of being sued due to "burgeoisie nationalism". After fall of communism things got better, but it would propably end like most of other eastern european countries(NATO, EU, Corruption, ZOG... First president after communism was freemason).
