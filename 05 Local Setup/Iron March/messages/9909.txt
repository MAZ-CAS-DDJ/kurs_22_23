<p>Well it is green! 2000 Honda civic</p>
<p>It was sold to me by some great guys, one of them drove me back after I went home to drop off the family car. We stopped for pizza, he introduced me to the owner. Great guy, Sicilian. We discussed various crime families and everything else under the sun</p>
