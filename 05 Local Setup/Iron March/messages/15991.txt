	Dear friend,
</p>

<p>
	I wanted to ask you something.
</p>

<p>
	I read a post from a guy named EvilCatholicNaziGoy.
</p>

<p>
	It made me so mad, that someone can be such a degenerate, and still be allowed on this forum. He calls himself a National Socialist, and he takes drugs. He calls himself a Catholic, and he have promiscuous sex. He is a disgrace to everything I stand for.
</p>

<p>
	So my question is, is it for me to judge people like that, or should I ignore them and look the other way?
</p>

<p>
	God bless you
</p>
