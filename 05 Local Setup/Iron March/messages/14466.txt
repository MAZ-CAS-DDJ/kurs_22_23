	Because of the new young IM members. I know I'm not going to convince any of the people I'm discussing with and it's not even my goal, what I'm trying to do is prepare good arguments for those who are joining IM now and will be looking for information and inspiration. Those can be influenced and if they see what Christianity really is, it's less likely they'll take it seriously.
