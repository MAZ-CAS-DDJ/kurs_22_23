<p>No problem. Yeah, the 8th is basically death, not much more to it. However, you can get different meanings by seing the chart from a different perspective. For example, if you're looking at a divorce settlement, your wife would be represented by the 7th house. In that case, the 8th house is the 2nd from the 7th, so it's your wife's possessions.</p>

<p>If the house descriptions seem vague, you can skip a little and go read the descriptions in "Christian astrology", they're quite thorough. Also, the second section of "christian astrology" is a list of questions, divided by houses, and how to answer them. So you can take a peek at the section on 8th house questions and you'll have a good overview of what the ancient's meant by "death".  Oops, now that I check, the "christian astrology" I sent you only has the first section, with the introduction to astrology. You can probably find the second section somewhere though. Here are the questions though, should still give you some idea:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>404.......If the absent party be alive or dead.</p>
<p>406.......Whether one absent will return.</p>
<p>407.......The time when he will return.</p>
<p>408.......Of the death of the Querent, or space of his own life.</p>
<p>409.......When or about what time the Querent may dye.</p>
<p>411.......Whether the Man or Wife shall dye first.</p>
<p>412.......What manner of death the Querent shall dye.</p>
<p>Whether the portion of the wife will be great, or easily obtained, or if the</p>
<p>woman will be rich.</p>
<p>414.......If one be afraid of a thing, whether he shall be in danger thereof or not.</p>
<p>415.......A figure to know whether man or woman shall dye first.</p>
<p>417.......A figure of a womans to know if her husband at Sea were alive or dead.</p>
<p>419.......A figure to know what manner of death Canterbury should dye.</p>
<p>421.......A figure to know If the Querent should have the Portion promised.</p>
