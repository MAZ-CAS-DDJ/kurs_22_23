<p>I'm not sure I'll have working internet or a computer in two weeks(again, phone).My idea centers around what has worked, helping fellow Americans still hurt by the economy. However, there's a unique twist- frontlawn gardens and certain other personal activities are aginst local codes. A recent "small news" story from Quebec had a house fighting to save their's. Done in enough places, with a connecting symbol, and you'll get widespread coverage. Add feeding or otherwise helping other Americans, the news story will forced to be as positive as possible.</p>
