<p>When I think of a state, I tend to think of a body. Give your body parts, your limbs high regional autonomy, and watch as you become unable to drink a glass of water. But give your brain too much power over every body part, and you find yourself unable to sleep because your lungs won't draw air without conscious stimuli from your brain.</p>
<p>In short, I think that there need to be a balance between the two. Regional governments must maintain a degree of autonomy, but federalism and confederalism should not be the case for a truly nationalist government.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And to be honest, in some cases, federalism does indeed assist in seperatist causes, as evidenced by how much the Kurds want it in Turkey,</p>
<p>which is in a way, that they will use our money to fuel their dreams of independence.</p>
<p>I will make it more clear with an anecdote.</p>
<p>One day, the organs of the body got together to decide who was to become the boss. Everyone said something. The lungs proclaimed that if they were not to breathe air, they'd not be able to live. The heart said, if he did not pump the oxygen through its arteries the body would die. The brain said that without his impulses, no organ would work properly. The kidneys, the liver all voiced their respective opinions.</p>
<p>But then, the asshole stepped forward, and said, "I am boss". Everyone made fun of him. And he said "if I cliff the hole you'll all be sorry."</p>
<p>No one took him serious so he did what he said he'd do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a while when the ballast began to accumulate, the intestines began to complain. After the intestines, the stomach. After the stomach, the liver and kidneys, after them, the heart and the lungs, and finally when deprived of nourishment and oxygen, the brain also accepted the bosshood of the asshole. After that day on, all assholes became bosses, and all bosses became assholes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In short, high regional autonomy will give certain regional governments to exploit those of lesser status, just as in Russia where Moscow the Vampire lives off of the blood of Mother Russia. It will weaken national spirit and unity, and allow for the rise of regional identities on the expense of the national identity.</p>
