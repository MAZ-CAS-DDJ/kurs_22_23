	Honestly there's nothing to be confused about, someone's fed you civic nationalist lies to pander to their own cowardice and inability to properly apply NS to themselves and reject foreign races from their community. If I'm not mistaken it's most likely someone in your militia. National Socialism has always and will always be exclusive to those of other races in so far as they are not considered members of the "volk." All of these foreigners during WW2 were ethnically segregated into their respective SS unit, does this mean Bosnians were considered members of the German people? No of course not.<br /><br />
	If you go by what the wiki article says, Blacks were subject to the Nuremberg laws, just like Jews and Romani which were obviously not considered part of the German people, were subject to forced sterilisation, and Hitler himself viewed Blacks in Germany as a contaminate of the German people (Mein Kampf.) In no way does that make them integrated into National Socialist Germany.<br /><br />
	What you're not understanding is that National Socialism is the application of the universal truth to mankind. Every race on this planet is capable of being a National Socialist, but that does not mean they are to be integrated into one another because that defies the very basic principles of National Socialism. Niggers from Africa can be NS, but that doesn't mean their outcome will be the same as an NS German and nor does that mean because these two groups are NS, can they intermingle into one another's community. <br /><br />
	Whomever gave you this idea purposefully made sure to make National Socialism look like civic nationalism, which is of course complete bullshit, because NS is first and foremost an ethnic nationalist belief. <br /><br />
	After you're done Next Leap, have you read Mein Kampf before?
