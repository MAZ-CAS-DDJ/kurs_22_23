<p>Yeah likewise, can't help but love my parents. I always had trouble keeping on weight, ate like shit throughout my childhood, worse than a muslim on ramadan except always. Gaining weight now though and kicking off all my bad habits this year. Never had any fat or a gut so I don't know that feel. I don't mind star wars, read a few books and played the kotor games and swtor. Games are a bad habit though, so I've cut them down real far. Always been an IT-oriented person. Aspiring to become self sufficient in that field. Haven't seen the new film. I haven't seen more than 2 movies in the last year.</p>
