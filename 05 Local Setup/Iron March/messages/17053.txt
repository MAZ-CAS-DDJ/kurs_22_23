	Romania never had a romanian king. The institution of monarchy in Romania is foreign and of foreign interest. Also, Codreanu is a man and man can be flawed. In a way, i understand his support for it, but his vision was skewed buy the times he lived in.

	You know very well, that the way God intended us to govern ourselves was through a form of High Priesthood, not kings. That is my hope and dream.

	V4 and Byzantium is not enough. We need a whole eastern federation block (without Russia if possible) and we need nuclear arsenal as deterrent.

	Also, if you're going to make historic claims of territory, may i remind you the magyar people originated from Asia(bozgor means man without country btw), not the current Pannonic Plains.

	If you're going to make claims on the way the population is spread out, then we should get zones from Serbia, Macedonia (aromanians), Moldova as a whole, parts of Bulgaria and Ukraine, not to mention very big chunks of Transylvania. If we should sit at the table and divide fairly, i have no problem what so ever. But sadly, we don't live in a fairy tale and right now we have more pressing matters to address. Like the muslim invasion and our societal degeneration.
