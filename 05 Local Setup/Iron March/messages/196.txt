<p>But the rules I broke, they were not broken to the extent that a posting ban should be issued, right? I am quite new here and don't know how punishments are given out, but I do think that is a bit harsh, eh?</p>
<p>I'm sure you can see my point here, I'm not the one who told someone to "take their shit to stomfront" so that I could "circle jerk" over there. If you can't get my posting ban lifted, perhaps suggest giving Vladimir a posting ban, at least then it would be fair.</p>
<p>I understand Vladimir is an established member, but as you said, everyone is punished equally, regardless of rank or prestige. </p>
<p>I would appreciate if you would talk to Benjamin about removing the gag, yes. </p>
<p>Thank you, Ben.</p>
