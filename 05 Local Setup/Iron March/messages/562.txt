<p>Hey, I just wanted to let you know I understand completely where you are coming from. The want and desire to see religion plagued from the earth is normal for any rational person. I have made very pro Christian statements on thisthe forum but that stems from an cultural understanding that America, despite the founder's intentions, has become a very religious country. We're not going to get anywhere arguing against it too heavily. At least not here. Hell, even in my ideal State thread I argue that religion is arbitrary and pretty much irrelevant. Some people just need religion, it keeps them in line in a way the State has never been able to. People like Talleyrand need some kind of external boogeyman to give him his laws and so he lives his life accordingly. People like you and I creae our own values and create systems and societies that fit our world view. We are not slaves. With all that said don't be a part of Atheistkult, simply be areligious and let the sheep have their imaginary shepherd</p>
