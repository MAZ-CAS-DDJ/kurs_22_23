	As far as introductions go, for anyone interested I'd recommend "The Underlying Religion" by Martin Lings and from there proceed onto the works of Rene Guenon and Julius Evola.

	Traditionalism states that there are multiple authentic Traditions which have a transcendent unity. In simpler terms, the same Divine Truth is expressed through a multitude of different symbols suited for different peoples, at different points in time. Traditionalism fully rejects the idea of progress and all philosophies of the Enlightenment. As a Traditionalist I demand the death of the modern world and the restoration of the prehistoric Golden Age.
