	For the record, in Seattle you have a kind of interesting split. Englishpeople like Bill Gates' family run the banks and law firms, Germans run the timber and manufacturing. Jews run the tech, but Seattle has very few Jewish people and most of its tech executives live elsewhere. The exception is Microsoft, which is run by liberal gentiles of English descent.
