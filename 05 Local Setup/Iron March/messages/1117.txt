<p>I had asked Slavros about this and he told me to come to you, since you handle the technical parts of the forum. The Link to the Iron Youth Radio still links to the Original Youtube channel, which is gone. I think it should be linked to the new channel (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/IronYouthradio2" rel="external nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/IronYouthradio2</a>).</p>
<p>Thank you for your concern <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
