<p>I don't like 4.0 dnd either but its all my friend has. Never played starwars. Anywho, I'm basically wanting to know if I can use d100 but reverse the poles so that you role high for the results and how to work out the resistance table or modify it for use of the d100 this way. I'm looking for simple so I'm also trying to find or make up, a simple combat system as well. I know this all vague but I'm really only in the first phases of this endeavor and I'm just kind of experimenting and brainstorming.</p>
<p>The game is called, the Spiral. It's like dark matter, CofC, and the xfiles rolled into one. The goal of the players is to advance the goals and agendas of the secret societies they join even if they have to fight each other or cut each others throats to do so. Example, one player wants to nuke NYC, the others do not want that, but the third is buying water and food corporations as he knows the prices of those commodities will go up. So how do the players stop the attack? How does the other player cover up his intentions? How did the PC get a bomb in the firstplace? You get the gist.</p>
