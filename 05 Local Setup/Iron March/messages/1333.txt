<p>Medication, alchohol or suicide, only 3 options. Getting through things like what you or other people say here will not be possible otherwise. Anyway it was nice meeting you but there are some things I now have to take care of. I read your site. Good job!</p>
<p>For me, I like liberal social policies, but I hate liberals because they lack the will to use any violence to enforce or defend this. I love Fascist military and economic policies. And nationalism of course.</p>
