<p>Messaging here because I'm way too drained to make a proper post right now. I believe there is a pre-ordained fate given to everybody by the divine, but we have the free will to obey or disobey that fate. If we follow this divine path, we will live the best lives possible and fulfill our destiny. All great people throughout history have at least partially followed that divine path. I've believed this for quite a few years, and it goes beyond your lifetime, into the lifetime of your ancestors.<br /> </p>

<p>In all honesty I have to believe in a cosmic power otherwise life would have no meaning</p>

<p>I think that goes for pretty much everyone. That meaning and that purpose is a large part of what sets you apart from others. Those without meaning or purpose will never achieve anything of note.</p>
