<p>Good luck with the uprooting and moving plan. Consider moving somewhere where you can help the local struggle, that's what I'd do anyway if I were to travel somewhere for an extended period of time. Can't really say anything on our local language courses for foreigners since I obviously don't fit the target audience, but I can look some stuff up if you're interested though I imagine its something you can find yourself since, again, they'd put out their advertisements into the english web.</p>

<p>I'm always up for meeting comrades from abroad, there's actually a number of people who are trying to get out here next year around summer time. If you come over we'll get tabor out as well and then you're guaranteed a few drinks and maybe some shenanigans along the way.</p>

<p>As for the "never imagined" bit, I never imagined I'd turn a Finn into a Stalinist or a Swede into a pro-Dostoyevsky-Russian "esoteric Stalinist" collaborator for when we take over Europe to save it from itself <em>moscoviterubbinghands.jpeg</em> joking aside it's not a long stretch all things considered if you're to compare the situation here and in the west.</p>

<p>So keep me informed on your Russia plans and like I said we'll get the gang together for the occasion.</p>
