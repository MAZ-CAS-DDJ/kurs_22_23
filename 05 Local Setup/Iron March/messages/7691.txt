<p>Yes, why shouldn't I be?</p>
<p>However I do not adhere to its international aspects, and instead focus on its national aspects, the duties that religion fills within society.</p>

<p>Alright, your ideology is it republican or monarchist?</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div></blockquote>
<p>Well, I am not sure. The founders of our ideology are not too clear whether a republic or a monarchy would suit us better.</p>
<p>However, modern Turkist keep on speaking of Turan as a "Khanate" so its fair to say that it must have a Khagan.</p>
<p>Whether this will just be another name for a president, or a true monarchy, we cannot say for sure.</p>

<p>Why not be Ottomanist and hope Turkey reclaim it's role as Caliph of Islam and then used that as excuse to reclaim it's terrioties and conquer the whole Middle East, North Africa and all the Turkic Tribes, your people are very religious, so use Islam as an advantage. Rastafarian is useful, for Blacks to know and praise a Black man and hopefully get them to be aware about the monarchy.</p>

<p>We have been through this, my friend. Ottomanism already failed the Turkish people before, when our Christian subjects chose to cut their ties with our realm, and so did our muslim brethren, the Arabs, during WWI. </p>
<p>Using religion as the primary motivation just will not do. Religion is supplamentary to ethnic nationalism, and serves to keep society clean.</p>
<p>Why would I want even more different ethnicities within our realm when we still have trouble with those who exist within our current borders?</p>
<p>Multi-national empires have shown themselves to be extremely self-destructive. What we want is stability.</p>
