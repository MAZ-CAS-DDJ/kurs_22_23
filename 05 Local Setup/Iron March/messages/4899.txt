<p>I am sorry for not being clear. I asked, somewhat incoherently, howÂ would you distinguish a GENUINE "modern" Christian movement from a Christian "Bolshevik" movement (such as Christian Democracy and Christian Socialism)? Christian Bolshevism is socially conservative but promotes Marxian economic policies. I am asking you because you are involved in Christian Nationalist movements whereas I am not inolved at all.</p>
