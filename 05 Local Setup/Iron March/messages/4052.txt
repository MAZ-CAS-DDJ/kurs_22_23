<p>Well if i were about to choose my western name i will stop on Edward like Edward the Longshanks <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>I rarely drink but wine is one of my favorite drinks so i really enjoy it..</p>
<p>I enjoy her. We are together for about 10 years and she know me from my "bad period" but nevertheless understand me and have patience with all my bullshits from my past and they are many as my hairs <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> and most of all share my political ideas and are pretty awake about modern day problems...</p>
<p>As for you dont have your girl i understand you bro. Modern women's have nothing common with womens before 3-4 generations: brave, dedicated, tough about moral values, restless, loyal to their mens. And have that old spirit of adventure and courage.. nothing compare to modern sluts who are not good even to prepare their own food.. But im sure you will find her, mate(like aussie says <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" />)  just keep tryin..</p>
<p>Btw how old are you ?</p>
