<p>Hmmm, when I think about Germany and Christianity I think Lutheran and Protestant values. When I take into account the knowledge I've gleaned from our conversations, I come to the conclusion that 'The German Character" so to speak is a composite of Protestant/Catholic/Jewish tendencies along with what composed the Reich regionally. It is actually making me think a bit differently about Hitler, maybe he should have just purged all dangerous elements from all religious spheres while integrating Jews, Austrians, Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox. He may have not had the chance, but maybe today's Germans do.[/Quote]</p>
<p>Hitler was also dealing with people in Germany who still did not think they were German.</p>
<p>Americans think they may have a problem with state nationalism. But imagine if those colonies had been separate kingdoms and for longer. Some in Germany felt they belonged to their traditional state, and that being German was a meaningless label.</p>
<p>Hitler had to unite these people in his nation and convince them there was one Germany, and they were Germans and to be proud, especially ones in the south who were more Catholic than Protestant and did not like northerners.</p>
<p>He did not target all Jews, because I have Jewish family that served in the Third Reich, but he targeted many (though I feel most of them were Polish). He also targeted some Catholicism too. As Bismarck did with Kulturkampf.</p>
<p>In hindsight, things could have been done more efficiently. I think Germany deserves another chance with National Socialism though.</p>

I suppose from here on out a Jew for me is going to be a religious Jew. So I have to say, IMO, you're just a German.[/Quote]<p>I am German. I agree.</p>
<p>But some Jüdisch do not consider themselves German over Jewish. I have met them before and we disagree.</p>
<p>I talked to a man who grew up in the eastern empire (it is Poland and such now).</p>
<p>He believed that in the same way you would put the survival of your child above the survival of another's child, then Jiddisch/Jüdisch culture should come first because it is closer to the family than the Protestant and Catholic families.</p>
<p>Thus, his loyalty began with basic family. Wife and children. Then, it went to the greater family. Then the Jewish community. Then the whole nation.</p>
<p>I suggested that the nation should come first because it is a single identity and the smaller identities should come second.</p>
<p>I had some interesting talks with him. But we had trouble agreeing because he is from a time where he was taught to be distrustful of Christians. And he says Jews today don't have to worry about Christians so it is easy for me to say that being German is more important than being Jewish first.</p>
<p>It is a difficult problem. I can see both sides.</p>
<p>At least for how things used to be (in his age), I compare it to Ireland. Both Protestant Irish and Catholic Irish are Irish. But this did not stop them from killing each other or seeing themselves as a religious group first and Irish second.</p>
<p>So Irish deal with similar questions I suppose.</p>

<p>I am guilty of such things too. I have stereotypes of some Christians. There are also very old stereotypes of non-German Jews, although modern Jewry is now progressive and thinks we should all be united, and I am not allowed to mock Balkan Jews and such.</p>
<p>The joke is that Balkan Jews are Arabs. Or Muslims who read the Torah, and are basically inferior. Although that is a nicer one.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="638" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>I feel this may be the case when I see mentions of "Talmud" and Pharisee. Many Jews don't use a Talmud. They reject it as legitimate. For example, Karaite Jews.<p>I wonder if the Nuetura Karta (obvious misspelling!) would be considered Kararite Jews. Although I'm still convinced that aspects of the Talmud have seeped into wider Jewish culture. Not to say that it isn't something that could be dealt with internally.[/Quote]</p>
<p>I have never really cared about the Talmud.</p>
<p>Some of the writers are smart, others are stupid.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="638" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>I guess Talmudist would be, while Pharisee is simply outdated. If the spiritual descendants of the Pharisees are a minority, then I shouldn't worry about too much about Jewish Supremacy being driven by a religious base.[/Quote]<p>Pharisees exist, if by Pharisee you mean Hasidic.</p>
<p>Hasidic Jews are assholes. Nobody except Hasidic or maybe Orthodox Jews like them.</p>
<p>They basically think that all non-Hasidic Jews are spiritually inferior and disliked by God. Which means they think most Jews are inferior and disliked by God.</p>
<p>I would not want to be confused with them.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="638" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Well this goes back to a Jewishness by religion, race, or culture. And I'm going to settle on Jew by Religion.[/Quote]<p>Do you think It is a culture too because religion is a culture? Like Protestant culture.</p>
<p>As for race, I think some semites are Jews, but not all Jews are semites. That is Zionist nonsense. And there have been two branches of Zionism fighting over this point for a long time. An older group of Zionists said it was a religion and they wanted Yiddish to be the language of Israel.</p>
<p>The other group were Sephardic brainwashed and believed in Hebrew and all things Middle Eastern. I am not happy that their brand of Zionism won out, even though it happened a long time ago.</p>

<p>I sometimes have good discussions with my Christian family on this point.</p>

For example, I see the neo-pagans who lack the esoteric view as very materialistic. When comparisons are made between Christ and Thor I laugh my ass off.<p>[/Quote]</p>
<p>In my opinion, materialism is its own religion.</p>
<p>People who believe in materialism do not believe in God. They believe in material selfishness.</p>
<p>They need to found their own religion now and write a holy book for themselves.</p>

It is complicated.</p>
<p>What do you think of religion, race, and nation? How do you balance them?</p>
<p>Are we what we believe first and our genes second? Or are we our genes and then what we believe?</p>
