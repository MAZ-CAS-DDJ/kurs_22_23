<p>It's interesting that you bring this up with me, it was actually an issue I had before converting. Here's my reasoning.</p>
<p>Leviticus 18 sets out the sexual sins. Feel free to read them for yourself, but I'll summarise them here:</p>
<p>No incest - don't even look at family members naked - interestingly enough though it's very specific in the family members you can't have sexual relations with or marry, yet it says nothing against first cousin mating; this will be a personal choice but in many cases it would be dishonourable to your parents and family which is a sin, if it interferes with their faith it is also not allowed. In many cases cousin marriage is taboo and not always the best cause of action, from a genetic co-efficient standpoint.</p>
<p>No sex with your wife and her sister - don't marry the sister/no orgies.</p>
<p>No sex with you neighbour's wife.</p>
<p>Don't be a queer or fuck animals.</p>
<p>"Fornication" i.e. pre-marital sex is simply not mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>2) The word "Fornication", or "Sexual Immorality".</strong></p>
<p>The main word translated as "fornication" or "Sexual immorality" is "πορνεία" or "porneia" (yes, porn). Porneia comes from the word "περναω" or "pernaō" which means "to sell off". The word for a prostitute is "πόρνη" or "pornē".</p>
<p>It is entirely reasonable then to suggest that "porneia", given its origins is not 'fornication' - 'pre-marital sex', but prostitution - whoredom. It really changes the tone of the book:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(Colossians 3:5)</span></p>
<p>"Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:" (KJV)</p>
<p>"Put to death, then, your members that are upon the earth -- whoredom, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and the covetousness, which is idolatry --" (Young's Literal Translation)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(Ephesians 5:3)</span></p>
<p>"But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;" (KJV)</p>
<p>"and whoredom, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints; "(YLT)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(Revelation 21:8)</span></p>
<p>"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." (KJV)</p>
<p>"and to fearful, and unstedfast, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all the liars, their part is in the lake that is burning with fire and brimstone, which is a second death.'" (YLT)</p>
<p>Hell, the word fornication itself meant sex with prostitutes! (The latin fornicari means to keep company with prostitutes, which itself is derived from fornix which is a euphamism for brothel).</p>
<p>I don't fully approve of "porneia" being only translated as "whoredom", as obviously it is not the only sexual sin (faggotry for example), "sexual immorality" is perfectly accurate, and as stated earlier "sexual immorality" (which I believe most translators use these days) does not necessarily include "fornication" as a bunch of dusty old pagan stoics (I assume) would have us believe.</p>
<p>As with everything that goes against the grain of modern Christianity there is a lot of shit about this from the other side that more or less amounts to "But that's how we've always translated it!", "muh church fathers", "muh tradition".</p>
<p>I have sex with my current girlfriend and we're not married, but it's not something we boast about. I've matured a lot in the sense that I believe a person's sex life should be kept private and no business of any body else, which is why I don't discuss it or boast about it. If I'm wrong it's something I'll have to answer to God about; I don't know everything. But there's a difference between bed hopping every Saturday night only going to church on the Sunday shaking off your hang over, and having sex with your girlfriend.</p>
<p>Here are a few articles regarding sex and christianity:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%207:27-28&amp;version=GNV" rel="external nofollow">The bible again in its timeless wisdom actually tells us to stay away from sluts</a>, stop being sluts ourselves, and find the people out there who still believe in traditional values (god's values, the oldest, highest and richest tradition). Our children are worth the risk of a divorce, which can be minimized statistically with proper mate selection and acting as a man should do.</p>
<p>I'm no fan of the "manosphere" or pick up artistry, they are posers, just as bad, whiny and as irresponsible as feminists. I play the game, I just don't play their game<strong>s</strong>. Most men are as much to blame for their problems as women are, but all you will get is accusations of man-shaming if you ever bring this up to a Mens rights activist or PUA. We have a biblical example of this type of mentality at Genesis where woman first corrupted man, not the other way round. Christian chauvinist writers did not hesitate to loudly point this out before the age of PCorrectness came in. But it has been wisely said: "<em>Adam blamed Eve, Eve blamed serpent, and God condemned all three</em>." God does not have patience with this "she/he seduced me" excuses.</p>
<p>Behind feminine seduction there hides even greater seduction - the demonic one - just as serpent first took out Eve before using her against Adam. Non-Christian misogynists are so often obsessed with the former that they open themselves to the latter.</p>
<p>The best thing to do would be to get married or save yourself for marriage. I tried to cover as much as I could already in the neo-feminism thread. Feel free to ask any more questions</p>
