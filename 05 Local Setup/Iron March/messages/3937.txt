<p>It's a bit spergy at times, Matt Parott is the Figure head of this project which was created by a dozen people. I was among them but kind of backed off with the, "Pacific Northwest Orthodox Monarch" part, however I guess the reason for that was to give future generations a goal to continually work towards while everything else false into place as the movement grows.</p>
<p>I was the one who encouraged them to try to turn it into a subculture to subvert the youth... then they all went a bit further what with converting Americans. In theory its great but I'm not sure about practice.</p>
<p>I am kind of stagnating off with it I'd like to work with them some days, others it just seems mildly autistic.</p>
