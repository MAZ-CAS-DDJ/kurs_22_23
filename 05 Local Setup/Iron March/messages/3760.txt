<p>I am fairly new the the ideas of Traditionalism. I come for a Libertarian background and discovered the intellectual and meta-political current of the New Right/Alt Right about a year and a half ago. I have been most influenced by the writings of Guillaume Faye and the speeches Jonathan Bowden. I have just finished reading 'A Handbook of Traditional Living' and have just started Evola's 'Revolt Against the Modern World'.</p>
<p>I chose the label<span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;"> "Radical T</span></span>raditionalism' for three reasons. First, it is recognizable to other forum users and gives me a handle, as it were, without narrowly defining myself. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>Second, I believe that the prior forms of our culture and greatness must be renewed and lived by each generation if we are to perpetuate our selfs as a people and as a force into the future. I think this idea is very much in keeping with Traditionalism.</p>
<p>Third, I believe that our system is irreparably corrupt. And that despite our advanced technology and material abundance our (western) culture is in a state of decay. We are trapped in a system that circumscribes both the left and the right mode of thought. In order to break though we must be ferocious in calling out the hypocrisy and decadence going on around us.  So, I suppose it is 'radical' because we should speak out by  speaking to the fundamental nature of man.</p>
<p>There is tremendous vital energy to be drawn from these traditional modes of thought. If we do not reconnect to these structures of belief and hierarchy we will not have the moral authority or intellectual energy to sustain  our selfs, our culture, our blood, through the coming hardships this country will face.</p>
<p>All this being said my views are evolving as I read new authors and connect with new people. What do you see as the features of Traditionalism?</p>
