	I remembered your aerosol can bomb idea from a long while back, and with their being some synagogues, a Jewish foundation, an anarchist bookstore, and other such places that are just a little over an hour away, I'm starting to have some ideas and plans in mind.

	What I want to ask is, do you have a recommendation for a certain brand of aerosol? Or, would any can of WD-40 and any can of aerosol with "Extremely flammable" on the back suffice? I thank you in advance.
