<p>I've had some success, we had an open debate in our town hall about something very minor, but I expanded on it and surely enough the village idiot came around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He used the libcollege 'philosophical' debate tactic, with empty words that have no heart or conviction in them. I shot him down pretty quick with your idea of using simple, relate-able and "common sense" arguments, and people actually applauded my responses and laughed at the idiot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since then I've been regularly meeting with around ~30 people who showed interest in what I was saying and wanted to know more about where I was coming from. I printed copies of Julius Evola's "Fascism Viewed From the Right" considering most people here are already Right-Wing conservatives. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've gotten emails from the majority of them telling me that it was a great read and it really "spoke" to them. They've distributed it to their friends, and next month's town hall meeting they said they were gonna bring their friends who now have an interest in local political policies and have been reading the packet.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>This is fucking great. Those 30 people or so have probably multiplied to around 50 because of them distributing it to their friends and actually getting them interested, off the couch, away from their TVs and actually reading and learning something.</p>

<p>I know what most of Ironmarch thinks of me, I really don't give a shit but I still wanted to let a brother know that there's success over here, and I wanted to thank you for your book, it's been invaluable at this point.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is fucking great, we have something here for the first time in a long time that isn't edgy skinheads with a bunch of retarded tattoos all over them going around calling everything a nigger.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These are actually professional people with families and slight community influence. </p>
