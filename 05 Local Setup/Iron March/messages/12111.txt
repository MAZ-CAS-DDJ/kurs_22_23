<p>Yeah, I pretty much do the same thing. Except I usually buy the CD's and put them on my computer and listen to it that way. That a way they are on my computer and I have a physical copy too. Which, I'll then listen to in the car. But yeah I like Arditi, Triarii, Legionarii, and definitely Von Thronstahl. Although to be honest, I don't know whether Von Thronstahl would be classified as neofolk. If not then that means that I only listen to Martial Industrial music then. Anyways, it is great to hear from you and thanks for answering my question. Until next time.</p>

<p>PS I recently bought an Arditi pin to ware on my jacket. It doesn't say Arditi on it is just the symbol with the addition of a sword it but I mostly bought it because it has a definite Fascist look to it.  </p>
