<p>Hi again, I was just wondering if you'd be willing to share how you started to discover fascism and the steps you took to best learn about it. I only ask out of curiosity but if I'm being perfectly honest with you and myself, I'm not exactly an expert on the topic. But I think it's more important that I want to learn more. I'm reading through our archive bit by bit but I was just wondering if you had anything in particular to recommend to an aspiring beginner in the subject. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
