	Slovak state-&gt;Politicians-&gt;
</p>

<p>
	There were 2 wings in HSĽS, one more radical, and one less radical. Notable members of more radical wing were Alexander "Šaňo" Mach and Vojtech Tuka(This man was formerly for restoration of Hungary in original borders, but then something made him proud Slovak). Their goal was to make Slovakia as much alike Germany as possible(laws, training of troops...) and make Slovakia serve German interests as loyal vassals(They saw protection from Germans as best option). Notable member of less radical wing was suprisingly Leader-President(his real title) Tiso himself. He wanted as much autonomy as possible and was kind a "soft". He didn't liked killing of underhumans very much. It was like that propably because he was a priest with heart full of love and holy light. However he was a good men. There was even a big protest when Slovaks heard about that he is going to be hanged, kikes wanted to get rid of him but they have made him a martyr. If i haven't written something you would like to know in this section just ask me

	Slovak state-&gt;Life of common people
</p>

<p>
	Slovak state got very good economics(propably because freedom from jews and Germans ordering stuff from our factories in big numbers), we were nicknamed "Eastern Switzerland" or something like that. Population was moral, religious, patriotic and loyal. There were flags hanging on streets and portraits/photos of our politicians(sometimes even Hitler) on market tables next to vegetables and fruit. Hlinkas guards had 300 000 members at its best. There were total 2 500 000 citizens of Slovak state, speaks for itself.
