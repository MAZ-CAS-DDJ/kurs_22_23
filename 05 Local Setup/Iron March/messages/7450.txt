<p>The rap song I sent you is actually about commie repression in former Yugoslavia. It's about bohemian youth in Belgrade who were dissidents in the former regimes and ended up in political prisons for decades. Extremely sad song but presented in a cool way, it was an instant hit here and it made people hate communism even more. We listen to it a lot here, personally I feel related to it in some way. I also like the folkish vibe and melancholic melody. I wish NS/RAC artists would look up to other genres and not just sing about generic "Hitler"/Rudolf Hess/White Power stuff. There's a lot of things us fascists could sing about from our perspective, rap genre could help a lot.</p>

<p>This is the music video of the song I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14I20qp1On0" rel="external nofollow">sent you</a>, it tried to recreate the old bohemian pre-commie vibe of Belgrade:</p>

<p>^^ This type of music is much more "traditional" to me than metal or rock. It's basically a creative interpretation of tradition.</p>

<p>It's also funny how commies pretend to be pro-fun and pro-urban while in reality they totally repressed any sorts of fun and destroyed everything urban with inviting peasant untermensch to cities, giving them apartments in commie pannel houses, while the anti-commie people from cities had to move out. Big cities in EE are practically only huge villages now.</p>

<p>The thing about Eastern Europe is that it's the best place for people like us <strong>right now</strong>. I have respect for every single Western European nation for what they did in the past, but right now when I see some typical Western European faggot here it makes me sick. I hope you understand that this is where my negative view of Western and Northern Europe comes from. Even the most untermensch people here usually have some anti-faggot views and don't mind casual racism about niggers. We had one commie guy (homo sovieticus type) training boxing with us and he was extremely respectfull, even though most guys in our gym are extreme right. We also made jokes about niggers together with him and he didn't mind that we're fascists, in fact he even started to respect the ideology once he saw we're not idiots as media tries to portray us and once he saw how good fighters we are. Our commies here are of totally different breed and a lot of them end up in our ranks once they see what we're all about and once they see what the other alternative is. Proud men stick together and everyone from left wing who's a man will end up with us at some point.</p>

<p>I work in tourism, mostly as receptionist in hostel, and some Western Europeans are simply disgusting. I'd like to beat every single one of them, I really mean it. Tourists from Eastern Europe are usually cool, even if they don't share political views they're usually cool guys to hang out with. I'm really sorry with what happened to your nations, what's all I can say.</p>

<p>I'd recommend you Bulgaria, cheap country with a beautiful seaside and nationalistic population.</p>
