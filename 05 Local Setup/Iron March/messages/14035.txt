	Actually, it was only my one grandfather on my mother's side who was a mason (women are not allowed as masons, women have their own masonic organization which my mother is not involved with), so it is not like I come from a line of them or anything. Also, he died before I was born and so I joined as a way to honor his memory, then I realized that I had to take my own path in life and that I truly didn't belong there like I truly belong on/to Fascism. (Sorry for bad metaphor). But yes, now you see my truth faith in Fascism and how dedicated I am to it. Which, is why I am contently afraid the Far-right will reject me someday for this shameful past. And that they would not listen to my story.Â
