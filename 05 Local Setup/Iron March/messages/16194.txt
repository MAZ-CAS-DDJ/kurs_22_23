	Thank you. I wont be going to boot camp until next Fall so I have a lot of time. I feel as if Canada is laxer with a lot of things. The US Military is anal about everything though. They will DQ at MEPS for stupid shit like underage drinking or hangnail.

	Have you ever talked to US sailors? How different is boot for Canadians?
