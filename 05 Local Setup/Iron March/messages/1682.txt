<p>I regret to inform I'll never see Asia, never had much of the inclination too on the grounds that I'd feel way to uncomftorable in a non-occidental nation, (russia and the Orthodox lands are the exceptions.) I'm glad you enjoyed your trip! Hopefully, if all goes as planned I should be travelling to Europe next year to meet Slavros, Ritz, Ben, Sev, and Siegfried. The trip will start in Russia and go through Romania, Germany, and the Netherlands, and then end in the UK.</p>
<p>I may bug you about a NSyndicalist article as the weeks develop, if this project does not interest you let me know.</p>
<p>Heh, I almost feel all of Asia is a shithole except Japan and Eastern China, possibly Singapore (The last Fascist stronghold XD.)</p>
<p>But alas, I'm a bit of an Occidental chauvinist haha.</p>
