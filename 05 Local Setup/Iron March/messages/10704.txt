<p>I'm 17 from the Southwest of England. I enjoy a range of topics such as politics, history, the military, religion, philosophy. I like to hike and read and enjoy gaming. I'm a deep nationalist and believe strongly in the cause of the UK, of our history and accomplishments to the modern world. The monarchy plays a huge role in this and I respect them thoroughly. I come from a military family. My father served in the airforce for 24 years and served in the falklands war and Northern Ireland troubles. My mother served in the army as a microfilm deliverer. I'm looking to join a nationalist organisation or a fascist one however good ones are hard to come about these days apart from NA. I plan to study Military history and uni. Â </p>
