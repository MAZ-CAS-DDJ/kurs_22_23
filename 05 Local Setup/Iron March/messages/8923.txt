<p>Cool injuries? Uh, no, I don't think so. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_sad.png" alt=":(" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/sad@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> Not even any cool scars. What a fag rite? I've never even broken a bone despite all the times I've dropped my dirtbike. I used to race four wheelers professionally when I was younger too, never hurt myself in any of the crashes I had there. I've never shot myself in the foot, and I used to start fires all the time and I've never burnt myself either.</p>
