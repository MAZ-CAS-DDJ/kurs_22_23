	Hey, mate. Your recent review in the EH thread made me realise that I am very far behind on reading. Sadly, I don't have that much time (work, last year in law school, trying to lift weights and maintaning social life/friends) but let's see if I understood correctly what I have to read in order to understand the basics of EH.

	Savitri Devi, Rene Guenon, Schuon, Serrano. Seems like a lot of work, especially since I am a complete newb in Philosophy. I honestly don't know where to start ( thought buying Nietzsche's books would be a nice start ). And the recent religious project is heavily conflicting me - I am born Orthodox Christian (not much of practising it), had the paganish "kike on a stick" rhetorics adopted. I am really conflicted and was wondering if you can help me how and from where to start. I have read quite a few books on nazi occultism, freemasonry and secret societies but I believe that is not enough. Relligion wise my knowledge is very poor. Â Philosophy wise - I can say I am fammiliar to a degree only with Schopenhauer and that's it. We have rather poor choice of books available in Bulgarian so the only option is English since I don't feel prepared to read anything like that in German so I thought it would be a lot more beneficial to start step by step and upgrade further. Thanks in advance!
