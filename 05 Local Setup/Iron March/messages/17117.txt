	Same with me, but that's going on anyway. Life is just more easier if you are a part of the majority, and that's how lemmings work. I can't really blame them though, it's not their responsibility, but should be ours.

	That's the miniaturized version of the geopolitical idea I follow, except the bad government of course. I don't really care whether our supranational Empire is led by Austrians or Serbs; as long as they are following the Truth and thus are keeping the national communities living there intact, they have my support.

<p>
	Yup and we really owe them for that, but strangely they were happy to become Communists when their loyalty was the most needed. They have also somehow just forgot to pull back from Transylvania, just as Serbia took Vojvodina; but what I was referring to was that if you are implying that today's Vatican is Catholic, than the Soviet Union was an Orthodox state. Soviets destroyed Orthodox churches - the <strong>anti</strong>-Pope lets other governments to destroy churches. Soviets tried to destroy the Church itself - the <strong>anti</strong>-Pope tries to do the same. This madman is clearly a heretic, but as I stated before, the corruption of the Church applies to Orthodoxy as well, even if to a smaller extent. What is it in the Catholic teaching what you are against? Or is that only the structure of the Clergy?

	Hmm. You know, it is possible that it will be similar to the fall of the Monarchies. In the XX. century the Monarchs lost their power, but Fascist leaders have kept the Monarchic system (well, in most of the cases) and ruled as some kind of Regents. I hope we can do something similar with V4, (like a Sedevacantist Union, lol) but I doubt that we will ever become Orthodox nations. I don't believe in national Churches. Eternal Truth doesn't give a shit about our ever-changing borders.

	Yeah, yeah, spare me from that. The "MINDENT VISSZA"-mentality was never a solution (Hungary is actually even smaller then it became after WW1, the same applies to Germany and to other states as well). It will just further destroy you, and that's not Defeatism - I want all of our territories back, not through Revanchism but its opposite. You will never let in your house somebody you don't like, but old comrades can even stay if they have to. You can live together with Hungarians, and if God helps us you will also learn how to live together with your Croat <em>brothers</em>.
