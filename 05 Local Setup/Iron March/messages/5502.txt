<p>Switching tangents, I have messaged Sam Westall new Nat Officer for England.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I see from his NBU profile that he runs (numerous) UK companies and has no qualms about declaring his support for the cause.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have asked him to offer some suggestions as to how I can stop lurking in the shadows with my views and yet minimize what I at least imagine may lead to damage to my local business profile.  I feel his view may well be short and sharp and revolve around "Grow some balls!"  We shall see.</p>
