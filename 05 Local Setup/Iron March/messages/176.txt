<p>This is sort of related: I posted this question on the 'Democracy?' thread and was advised by Vladimir to ask you, the 'resident expert on Mosley'.</p>
<p>"I keep hearing about Sir Oswald Mosley trying to create a government which was both authoritarian enough to get things done and responsive enough to the popular will that it could be removed from power if it screwed the country up, but the only specific I know is that he wanted to get rid of 'the opposition'."</p>
<p>Could you explain further his ideas about this?</p>
