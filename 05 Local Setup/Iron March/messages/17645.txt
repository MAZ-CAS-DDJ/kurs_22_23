	Sorry to keep you waiting my friend, I will post my answer in a week.

	Until then, you were asking about some sources: only two comes to my mind, those are <em>'The Mystery of the Cathedrals'</em> by the Alchemist Fulcanelli, and the <em>'Christian and Oriental philosophy of art'</em> by Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy. Even if your English is way more better than mine, I would recommend to read those in your mother tongue (if it is possible).

	The other thing I found recently when I was looking for materials for one of my projects is <a href="https://quadralectics.wordpress.com/" rel="external nofollow">this blog</a>. I didn't had the time to read even the Introduction, but it seemed interesting so I link it anyway. :D
