	Why are you still barking boy? A real man would give his address and not fear any other man, only a coward boy hides behind the computer and refuses to give his location.....

	But this is the entire problem with Ironmarch, you are a bunch of kids who thinks imaginary internet points even matter. It becomes a race to the bottom as everyone bottom feeds popular opinion for points, and that they do not drift from groupthink in order to avoid losing internet points or status on the forum... You see where I am coming from? I am not welcome on Ironmarch because I do not play by these rules, I do not conform to groupthink like all of you, and I am not afraid to challenge users with more "internet points".... Even if my logic was indeed correct no user dare agree with me publically  in order to avoid losing internet points or status..... This information is straight from the introduction books, yet like the pseudo-Christians who claim to be so in-tune with their religion, yet making many errors against the bible. You too are a useful idiot to impede the progress of real Fascism.

	Whatever preconceived notions you have of me or my character.... It is truth (and you agree but will never admit) that I am more of a man then you. ..... Because not only do I fear no man, I am not a fool like you to conforms so easy.... You and people like you on Ironmarch will NEVER accomplish anything of benefit to the Fascist cause, you're also useless idiots to the left too because real revolutionaries are quickly repulsed from here (The Jew loves your work). Maybe you will never understand me, but if you do you will see I am right, and maybe you will want to apologize for your insolence, but I will no longer be on this website but making real change, no longer will I be able to check.... But it doesn't matter because why do I care for your words when you are a coward not only for your race, but to manhood. I am leaving this site now and I will not read your long autistic reply... Think of who is the real person with autism here.
