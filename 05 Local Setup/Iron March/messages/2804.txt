<p>Oh yeah, I know what you are talking about. These esoteric new age shitheads piss me off, too. Aryan is a scientific term and has to be used in a serious manner.</p>
<p>The situation here is awful. Ukraine is ruled by criminals, the economic situation is as bad as it can be and politics are a soap opera. I think you in Bulgaria have similar problems, or am I mistaken? I also heard that you have lots of trouble with gypsies.</p>
