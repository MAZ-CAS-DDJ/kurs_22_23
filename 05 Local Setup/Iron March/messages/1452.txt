<p>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were indeed influential thinkers and deserve a mention.</p>
<p>Friedrich Nietzsche, Charles Darwin and Richard Wagner deserve the the utmost respect.</p>
<p>I share quite a few number of views with Mr. Shaw.</p>
<p>About Mr. Stirner I do not know what to say, nor about Mr. Sorel. Could you elaborate on their influence upon you? Especially on Sorel, since Stirner is relatively obvious.</p>
