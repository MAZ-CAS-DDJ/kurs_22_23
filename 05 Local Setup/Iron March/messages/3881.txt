<p>Pff in these days this is hard question.  As a socialist i dont wait god to come and "show me the way" but with that degree of moral decaying and islam threat from neo-ottoman Turkey i begin to think more and more about Orthodox christianity (as a institution almost Orthodox without christianity within)  and it ways to legitimate our struggle... Some small nationalist groups (mostly free radicals) already infiltrated some christian communities as orthodox deacons and sub deacons and this repays them in some way but i really dont know how this will end..</p>
<p>Other than that as a NS i have strong interest in old Pagan religions. Odinism for example is fine example of true old European "character" corresponding to the local people, their wrath and understandings. Celtic and Welsh religions and mythology is also fine, Maybe because their distance in time and situation they look romantic and enthusiastic to most  modern people and even the ones who truly have some interest in them failed to see their everyday use and true nature and instead begin some druid circus who is at least harmful. But this corespond only to western and central Europe.</p>
<p>In east we have different paganism one of the old Scythians and Sarmatians wich corespond to our customs and believes which are not bond to forests like the Germans but to Mountains and Steppe with their gods of fire like Agni or their heroes as Kolaksay.. Also Zoroastrianism which is the southern Aryan religion..</p>
<p>In two words: my oppinion on religion is deep respect to the old ways. Repect to people who forge their gods in their image and likeness not some foreign religion imposed by slutty romans which destroyed the true nature of peoples..</p>
<p>I hope you understand me with my bad english.  Disregard some sentences who might sound like hippie talks but different language transmit different emotions..</p>
