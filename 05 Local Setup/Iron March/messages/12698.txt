<p>Ben,</p>
<p>I have been an avid follower of National Action and admirerer of your work ever since I heard about you guys on /pol/ and the Daily Stormer. A few high school friends and I have started a group called Reaction USA and are seeking to emulate National Action and work with Atomwaffen. We have read all of NA's publications and are starting to use PGP encryption. I spoke with my friend WeisseWolfe (known him for 3 years) and I thought it would be a good idea to Skype you sometime and discuss leadership advice and maybe get some pointers from a veteran of the National Socialist struggle.</p>
