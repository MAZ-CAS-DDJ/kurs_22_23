<p>I'm glad you've asked because I've actually been reading more dual seed-line stuff myself recently and I actually see the point and agree with A LOT of it now (I agree that many of the "Jews" today are likely to be descended from Cain). I can even agree that it's not as simple as satan being a snake, but one thing I haven't seen covered and can't wrap my head around is Cain being the offspring of the devil. I can see where the theory comes from, but what was being referred to when God said they could eat of every other tree of the garden if the sin in the garden causing the fall was a sex act with satan? It would have to be an orgy as well because Eve offered the "fruit" to Adam as well. That is now really the only issue I have with dual seedline theory.</p>
<p>It's something I'm not sure on myself. Either way, dual seedline or one-seedline theory, many of the same principles are there and it's just a matter of specifics between the two, just minor disagreements.</p>
