<p>Damn, I can't get either of them to work. I'll try it tomorrow at the library. The commentary on the second site is ridiculous.</p>
<p>"Bad reactions have been reported by those watching this video.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<p>Vomiting , loss of appetite, rage, sadness, nausea, dry heaves, stomach pains, nightmares, feeling suicidal, fear, shaking, trembling, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, chills, headaches, rapid breathing, inability to move, spinal chills, sweating, churning stomach, anorexia (weight loss due to not eating), flashbacks, insomnia, crying, laughing and crying simultaneously, agoraphobia (inability to go outside), anxiety, depression, loss of consciousness (passing out), urinating on oneself or feeling one is about to urinate on oneself and inability to stop thinking of the video.</p>
<p>Adverse reactions have lasted typically hours, but some may last a day or more. A few long-lasting reactions, including reactions that look like anxiety, depression or a combination, have been reported, lasting usually up to a day, sometimes up to a week, and rarely for months.</p>
<p>One hospitalization has occurred due to this video. A worker watched the video in his office, was so upset that he went outside to have a cigarette, and was shaking so hard, he could hardly smoke it. He then fainted and hit his head on the sidewalk, knocking out some teeth. If you faint easily, do not watch this video.</p>
<p>If you think you may react in any of these ways, please reconsider whether you really want to watch the video."</p>
<p>Now I'm curious!</p>
