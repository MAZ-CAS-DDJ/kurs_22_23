	Ha ha ha yeah I hear that. Though I did play it all day today though, and full discloser everyday this week after work I am going to play it for several hours but that is only because this week I am taking a week long break form the gym because I hurt my neck (I either sprained it or slept on it wrong but either way I am going to wait a week before resuming my workout routine just to be safe, because it really fucking hurts). Of course next week I also go back to uni and between uni, work, and working out I won't have time for the old republic (which is my plain). Meaning I will only play it on holidays or other university breaks, or if it is a bad winter snow days :) Which is why I am going to play as much as I can this week, without approaching neckbeard territory. As for other local Fascists, I am the only one. I live in a small very cuckservitive town. Maybe if I change my attitude this year at uni and try to be more outgoing and charming, then maybe I can get a girlfriend  I can mold into a Fascist. Though this is highly unlikely tbh. I'll probably just have to bite the bullet one day and try online dating, it might make finding a women with a similar ideology easier. Anyways, glad you liked Mishima's Patriotism! To answer your question though I don't have any other books by him though, but I'll admit that this one sounds interesting and I might get it in the future. <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/sailor-who-fell-from-grace-with-the-sea-ukio-mishima/1103528662?ean=9780679750154#productInfoTabs" rel="external nofollow">http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/sailor-who-fell-from-grace-with-the-sea-ukio-mishima/1103528662?ean=9780679750154#productInfoTabs</a>  I have too many books too, which is why Lutzifer calls me an "autist". Anyways sorry for rambling on and let me know if you get this.

	PS What do you think about the online dating idea? Also, please don't discuss this with anyone else here. Your my friend and I trust you which is why I am even bringing this up.
