<p>I've read his writings before but I havent seen that one, very interesting indeed. The Germans actually had a pretty organized system for their tribal warfare; each tribe had so many cantons and each canton was required to supply 100 men to the war effort. This also applied on a larger scale when multiple tribes united together against a common enemy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Germanic tribes were very interesting as well, I've done a great amount of research into them and trying to track down exactly what tribes I come from. I'm sure its impossible at this point because of how much the tribes migrated and mixed with each other, but I know for sure I am Anglo-Saxon, Suebian, Frankish and Alemanni. Beyond that I don't know. </p>

For some reason they also intentionally mix linguistic terms with cultural terms when they talk about Ancient Europe, like I have done above to illustrate this, to spread confusion.</span></p>

<p>I Found it hard as first to identify as a pagan because so little is known about gallic deities, but after further research on the matter i found out the gods are indeed identical, for example lugus and odin both had red hair, where accompanied by a raven and had a spear, It is much easier to identify as a 'pagan'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>About history i don't really know much but what i do know is the tribal structure of the Gauls</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The most important component was the family, a group of families made up a 'clan' and multiple clans would form a tribe, even though gauls fought with other gauls all through history they all had common holy sites and all the druids of all the tribes gatherd peacefully there, Gauls knew they were 1 people which is proven by how quick they could unite against external enemies.</p>
