	Yeah we're just meeting to get a handle on each other, and I understand the time constraint. It's not a huge issue. We have the whole summer, and missing one meeting won't be the end of the world. Depending on Breivik's availability on Tuesday, we might not meet this week at all. If we don't meet this week, then perhaps mid-June? I am going back to Ohio for a few weeks. Leave next Friday.
