<p>Hello brother,</p>
<p>I wondered what your thoughts were on polygamy; I'm torn on this question myself because I think the example set by Adam and Eve of kind after kind and one man-one woman is most likely the way God intended things to be, however, in Deut 21:15-17 we see clearly written that polygamy is allowed. I'd assume that it's never intended to be the norm and ideally it shouldn't because most men can't even handle one woman or even get one woman, let alone two.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? I didn't deem the question worthy enough for a thread of its own.</p>
