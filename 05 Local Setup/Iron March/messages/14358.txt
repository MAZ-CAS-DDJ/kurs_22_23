	Spoke to Odin, he seems interested in making a tutanota email, thanks for the recommendation.

	Yes there is a long-term strategy: You have to understand that trying to start a mass movement on Western soil today is literally futile. It will never work. The media has the luxury taking any "legitimate" NS/Fascist movement and saying "Oh look, they're racist" and you're essentially barred from mainstream politics after that. Not to mention that lemmings want to be comfortable, and anything that causes them discomfort, like being a Nazi, isn't their cup of tea. Therefore we have to resort to different tactics when trying to push our message. The Stickercaust is our main form of activism so far because of two reasons: 1. The fear it causes makes the situation uncomfortable for the average Joe, and 2. People who think like us but hide in the shadows will be able to find a way to contact us. The Stickercaust tactic gives us a way to push ourselves into media attention. Taking a page from GLR here, all publicity is good publicity, and if we can get in the public eye, we do two things: Disrupt the system and get more recruits. If BLM has a chimpout at a campus we stickered, that helps us one hundred times more than it helps them.

	We also have plans to buy property in the future, as well as set up other things which can benefit us. We're working on getting all of our guys into small business and money making to secure their employment, ensure funds for the group, and make sure all of our members are capable of gaining employment if they don't already have it when they join. For example, one of our guys recently lost his job for holding a "God Hates Fags" sign at an Orlando shooting vigil, after one of those fags pulled his mask off of his face. We're working on helping him get a new job working for another member of the group now. If we can be nepotistic to the point of not having to worry about things like this, we are able to get more active without fear of repercussions.

	What tactics does <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> use and what are their goals? 
</p>

<p>
	Also, if you could direct everyone who's asked about making an American <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> chapter to this website to message either myself or Odin, that would be greatly appreciated.
