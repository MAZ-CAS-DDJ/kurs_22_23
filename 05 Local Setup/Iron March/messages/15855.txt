	I've been pretty fine, doing some work and stuff like that. Didn't get a shirt yet, though.

	About Breker - there are a couple of his works surviving, but I don't know where they are. I know they once had a temporary Arno Breker exhibition, you know, those kinds of exhibitions where a museum borrows pieces from one particular artist to make a themed exhibition. It was considered to be "controversial" because Breker was a nazi, hurr durr.

	But statues still exist, yes.
