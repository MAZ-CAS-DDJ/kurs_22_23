<p>"Thats completely normal for tribes which lived together for ages" Or one conquer the other.</p>
<p>Man if you ask me you are Finn-Ugrians with strong Varangian (Viking) gene. The slavic shits came later and was adopted by communists and there was the major slavification came in...</p>

<p>The glagolic alphabet was made for the slavs, but for religious reasons. (The greek alphabet wasnt usable for their slavic language at that time. But thats not important, I posted the glagolic alphabet to show you the date 863. The slavs already existed.)</p>
<p>Finn-Ugrians is right, but not complete. You see, Russia isnt homogenous.</p>
<p>Its a mix of a slavic majority with strong scandinavian influence. Later with greek influence.</p>
<p>Thats why the russians cant create a nationalism like in germany. Russia isnt a Nation, but more an own civilization.</p>
<p>In the USSR never was a slavification. They supported the idea of Catherine the great, that the russians were a part of scandinavien tribes.</p>
