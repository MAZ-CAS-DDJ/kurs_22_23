	Fascist of course. But you should know the deal - It doesn't officially exist. There are a few member on this site who are part of it. Its for Polish blood only though. Right now my group is networked in Southern Poland and New England/Tri-State. Some members are ex-military, or still in. Me and a few others still need to serve. Military experience is a must. Its a pretty long term project. I started it when I was your age - 16. We're still branching out.
