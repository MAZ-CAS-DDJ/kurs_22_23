<p>I think I am eventually going to make a thread about the cultural origins of B'reshit mythos and Akkadian culture. Such as the linguistic origins of Elohim, and the Ugarit pantheon. In this pantheon, El Elyon was a premier god. A basis for the plurality of God (we see in B'reshit that God is not called Y'hvh until after creation. During creation "they" are simply Elohim. The word as well as the concept is derived from Akkadian culture).</p>
<p>The creation story of Sumeria holds some similarities concerning Enlil. The serpent is a repetition from this story.</p>
<p>In the Torah it says...</p>
<p><em>Exodus 10:8 Cush was the father of Nimrod; he began to be a valiant warrior on the earth. (9) He was a mighty hunter before the Lord (Elohim). (10) The primary regions of his kingdom were Babel, Erech, Akkad, and Calneh in the land of Shinar. (11) From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, (12) and Resen, which is between Nineveh and the great city Calah.</em></p>
<p>There is an Akkadian expression that says, "A mighty hunter before Enlil." And another Sumerian-Akkadian expression referring to the "lords of heaven."</p>
<p>From a linguistic study of Hebrew, we see that Hebrew as a language would have evolved after proto-Hebrew (or the beliefs of Hebrews prior to Moshe/Torah) already existed, from Avraham--as a mishnah.</p>
<p>For traditions, you are right. Jewish traditions today are somewhat different than pre-Torah or early Torah Hebrew traditions. However, I do consider Judaism to be a cultural legacy of Sumeria in some way. I think this is a good thing.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be interesting to have a discussion with you about this on the forum, as it relates to fascism.</p>
<p>To the monarchy, I only asked because a monarchy would be a good blood connection to the land of Judea and Israel. They do not need to hold absolute power, but rather perhaps be figureheads and represent the history of our culture as a Kingdom. Or at least the two Kingdoms. With the King, system of government with more power can possibly be operated.</p>
<p>I do not think the King should be a welfare ruler though, so his political roles would still be determined. Perhaps as more judicial than as an executive.</p>
