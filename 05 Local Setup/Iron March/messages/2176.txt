<p>Hello comrade,</p>
<p>Here's the introduction I made a long time ago:</p>
<p><a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/30-belgian-blackshirt/" rel="">http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/topic/30-belgian-blackshirt/</a></p>
<p>In addition, I'd say I'm one of the first members of this community, even when it used to be on another board. I'm a former Admin, and co-writer of the Forum's Chart with Alex Slavros...even if many an article of said Charter seems not to be enforced anymore lately ((but that's another debate).</p>
<p>I used to be here a lot, but I don't have the time anymore.</p>
<p>I was once called the most socially "Liberal" Fascist of this forum (not sure if it was a jest or an insult) due to my indifference to stuff like gay issues (what people do inside their bedroom is not anyone's business), divorce, religion/atheism...</p>
<p>I can't stand conspiracy theories, whether they be jewish or not. I consider most/all of it are urban myths not based on any objective facts. Speaking of Jews I lived for many years in the Middle-East, including Jordan and Israel. To the dismay of many third positionists, I am a friend of Israel and consider it a good example of nationalist palingenesis. I have a grudge against Jewish lobbying and the fact of their dubious allegiance (Israel or the country they live in), hovever it is based on sound reasoning, not emotional, hateful shenanigans - and oh dear do you see a lot of that around.</p>
<p>I would probably be a National-Socialist except that I don't go for their racial theories. </p>
<p>Neo-feminist harpies and die hard patriarchal ultra-traditionalists are met with the same disdain and hilarity in my worldview.</p>
<p>And much, much more I guess...</p>
<p>Best, WiB</p>
