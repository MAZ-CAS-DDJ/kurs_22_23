<p>That article was extremely autistic and I didn't understand most of it so I will instead tell u what my ideal society is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My ideal society would be to eliminate a good portion of the population leaving behind anywhere from a few thousand to a few million, or possibly tens of millions in an extremely lenient case (have not yet decided). This is good for the environment and the optimal way to promote the evolution of the human race, or rather, to stem its decline. If you can imagine a few cycles of taking only the top 0.01% of a population and then having them create another, society, and then repeating the process you can see how this would be a good idea. It also cuts off a lot of the 'dead weight' around the world (i.e. niggers).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My ideal weapon would be a race specific bioweapon that could target particular genetic sequences but that would require identifying the 'good' genes and the development of race specific bioweapons.</p>
