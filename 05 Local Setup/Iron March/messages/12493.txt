Interesting. I agree somewhat, but would you mind explaining? I understand it with gods that accept you into Heaven just for heroism, but what about ones that send you to Hell for being a nonbeliever? Can all those gods really exist at once?</p>

What a grandad! I envy you. Is any of your family Amish? Do you speak Pen Dutch? Gotta love the universality of the swastika. Can't wait for it to take its rightful place as a symbol for good once more. Do you follow the more recent Germanic folk traditions as well as the old Germanic religion? Folk traditions are fascinating, imo, especially folk healing vs the fear of witches.</p>

What do you do with offerings after the gods have had them? Absolutely. There's something deeply unsettling about the unnaturalness of American food. Good, solid mode of worship you have there (very ora et labora). Mind if I steal some of your ideas?</p>
