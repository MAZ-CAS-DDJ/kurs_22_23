	By the way, don't take this as me totally shitting on your ideas, because I really understand the use of blue as a tribute to America, but you'd need to mix Red, White, and Blue in a really specific way to make it work. Simply blue would clash with the black everything else. I probably sound like a little girl nitpicking over details on fashion, but <u>image is everything</u> with movements like this. We gotta come correct with the fashy aesthetics.
