<p>Is that a prominent president you have as an avatar? I've noticed you here and there and I've been meaning to ask you about it. I like reading up on american colonial history and philosophy so it got me curious.  Also, I saw your ideology was right wing libertarian/quasi-fascist. Most Americans don't like fascism, mostly because it's not American. Where do you stand on it?</p>
