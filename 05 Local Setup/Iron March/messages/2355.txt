<p>The things are not going well at all.. Now we even change our history books with some new more PC and shits.. You will see it personaly after 10 years if you really pull the short stick...</p>
<p>Well how well do you know the politics here ? They all are same ex-socialist secret police informants thugs, money stealing, EU ass licking, people fucking mostly jews or masonic bastards and oligarchs and so..  Ataka is no different from them . In ideology they are some rusophilic, serb-like, schovinist, orthodox cristian, anti turk and anti muslim movement in some very silly "patriotic" way but that is only a facade they are just like any other party only difference is that they play a "nationalism" card cuz they dont have any chance to take other voters.. Dont take them seriously they have perfect opportunity and blew it.</p>
<p>But if you look other parties like "Bulgarian National Alliance" there is whole different story. They are fine NS movement. They have some problems with legalize own party but have some successes but the ruling elite dont want them in politics cuz if they enter in politics one day will bring all traitors to the wall and shoot them literally. Most of its members are young idealist who using their heads for thinking not only to endure hangover. They are fine nationalist. Ideologicaly they are genuine NS not only left or right, both are go hand to hand (without marxist or liberal shits e.t.c). In other matters they are conservatives but not like russian or serb cons who lived in past ages but try to protect our traditions in 21century. Other than that you know anti gay anti emigrant, anti colonial government (something that you will have soon..) every thing that any self respect nationalist org will do. With 2 words you will be proud to have such movement in GR. We and them have some nice co-works and they are just fine..</p>

<p>What do you say about GD they seem to me like Ataka in beginning...</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Yeah unfortunately we know this shit here in Greece as well. They keep writing history books, that even claim that the Ottoman Rule was nevertheless ok (!?!?!)! After all, the fucking EU has been in Greece for 20 years longer than in Bulgaria. Do your best to awaken your compatriots to drive of these leeches away. Ive met some Bulgarians in the island i was residing and they were West-philes..</p>
<p>And im really sorry to hear that ATAKA is a sold-out to the system party, At least in some videos they look really militant and solid. But you know better, and if you say they are just far-righters i will take your word in it.</p>

<p>As for Golden Dawn, in no case its like ATAKA. From day one we went into the parliament we've been confronting the old politicians in every matter. Gypsies, immigrants, Health agencies, banks. Although we made mistakes that if our enemies were a bit decent, they could use it us excuse to crush us. Nevertheless, now GD is on a turning point. All this people that now come in our ranks, have stupid chauvinistic ideas. Either they will get the upper-hand and GD will be another far-right party, or the Movement will take the upper hand, and these people will form a fine NS mass-movement.</p>
