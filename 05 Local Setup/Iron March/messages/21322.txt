	Hey mate, just sending this message as I have a few questions. I'll keep it short.<br /><br />
	1. What do you use for printing your flyers? Home printer, or commercially?<br />
	2. Whats the cost per page?<br />
	3. What do you use to put them up?<br />
	4. I'm setting up a PO Box. Am I able to get some flyers sent my way.<br />
	5. I'm in SA. aiming to stir the pot with the 'anti-fag' posters.<br /><br />
	Think thats all.<br />
	Thanks, I look forward to hearing from you.
