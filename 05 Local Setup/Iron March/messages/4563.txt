<p>Excellent, thank you for the extremely in-depth reply. Definitely does provide a lot for me to think on. I'm in a fairly similar boat myself (<em>having sex with my girlfriend who I've been with for over two years, though when we got together at the time neither of us were really Christian, and I'm the one who's been leaning back towards it</em>). At this point I do need to find a good church. Sadly, being in a college city means I'm surrounded by feely-good "emergent" churches that talk about nothing but love and acceptance. It'll take some searching for sure.</p>
<p>And yes, I agree pretty much on your assessment of the 'game' scene, mostly the type of guys that follow RooshV and similar pickup artists. I mean, if your only claim to manliness is how many low self-esteem college girls you can have sex with... You're still doing nothing but chasing pussy after pussy in the end. I understand the argument that this is kind of like Man's way of using the Feminist sexual liberation against itself, but, fuck man, one woman at a time in my life is plenty. There's so much else out there to accomplish.</p>
