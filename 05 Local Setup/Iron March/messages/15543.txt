	Thanks! Is memrise an app I can put on my phone? Also, what about something like <em>Italians for Dummies </em>(which comes with an audio cd I think) ? Also, I may have to start learning Italian next summer or at a very slow pace, because I have my hands full this semester, including beginning to learn German (taking German at uni). The more I think about it the more I want to see Italy. Want to see some of the few remaining fascist monuments and maybe Casapound HQ. Don't know how'd they (Casapound) would feel about me being an American though. Though, maybe I'll get a pass because I'm fash :) Thoughts?
