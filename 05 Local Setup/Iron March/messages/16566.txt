	Eh, you are talking to a guy who wares 10 1/2 inch docs and tucks his pants into to them so....LARPYness is only really a slight concern. On the bright I have actually had people I don't know come up to me and say they like my boots though lol. Would just be for winter ware really with it being wool and all. Also, you got to remember that when it starts getting cold I ware a black field jacket with this pin on it. No the pin is not this big btw

	So yeah, I do try not to look too LARPY though. Also, is it just me or in some of those Varg videos is he wearing a M43 field cap with the "pea" camo? PS Please don't share this because this is kind of embarrassing now that I think about it.
