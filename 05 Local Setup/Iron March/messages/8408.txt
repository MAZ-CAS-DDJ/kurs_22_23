<p>In 1993 after much progress Ben klassen gave control of the church to a con man who vanished with a semi truck full of our books. So we decayed for e years till matt hale took over and we grew well over 30,000 members until his arrest in 2003. Reverend logsdon took over but he only kept the organization alive its not until 2013 where we chose to build a council to get things restored to where we could choose a pontifex maximum again. We have annual goals or stepping stones to meet each year. This issue of leadership with legal issues the government has foisted upon us has beenvour greatest obstacles.</p>
