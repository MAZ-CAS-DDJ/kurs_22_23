	I would not rather just support the Southern Separatists, but all of them. There isn't a SINGLE region in Brazil that does not or did not have a separatist movement. There's a reason why we were an Empire and not a Kingdom.

	Yeah, that's what they preached about, and I get quite triggered at it, because it's artificial. It's almost the same if Rockwell told the Americans that the American culture was to be enforced and that everyone should get mixed. It does not make sense. Spiritually, we are VERY different, even if most Negros now follow Evangelism, they still hold the cultural tradition of Africa, and most mulattoes and middle/higher class WHITES adopt African spiritualistic such as Candomble and Ubanda - even the African communities of those 'religions' come to Brazil to learn, as we have the most 'traditional' cults. I have learned a lot from this, and Kardecism also flirts with those African cults (my family as an example - they treat like they're from Rosenkreuz followers). Seriously, the higher strata of the society is FILLED with those cultists, all our presidents so far since the 80s have been involved in this, as well as most major politicians, and the intelligentsia is also part of this. It's very weird, it's almost like that Pizzagate thing, but it didn't blow and it's a little less 'bizarre'.
