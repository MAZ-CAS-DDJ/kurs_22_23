<p>The meme culture hit me on the way in haha. But I understand that this is just a ntaural evolution of youth culture. It just has to be, utilising the cultural narrative to drive home points.</p>
<p>You have to understand, most guys here are teens and thus all that entails comes with it- the idea of a  Fascist girl is rare and amazing to an isolated kid. Remember, these kids will all grow up in time. That's what annoys me, they don't get my sometimes stiffness and lack of ability to get on with some of them is because I'm older (24) and pretty mature for my age. I see this place as a pretty neat boot camp, nothing more.</p>
<p>You're still young, you'll be surprised how much can happen in a few years. Don't worry about the ineffectiveness of others. Just do what you have to do, and never give in.</p>
<p>I admire your struggle, and trust me, nothing great comes without struggle or suffering. I'm always to speak or vent if you need it.</p>
