	We're a big country. :P Like, I brought up Seattle because it's "the big city" where I'm from, even though it's several hours away. There are pretty huge differences between America's regions.<br /><br />
	Also, here "white gang" basically means "skinhead gang." There's a decent amount of those though, mostly for kids in poor communities that border the ghetto.
