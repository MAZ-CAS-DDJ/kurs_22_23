<p>Im a member of a forum that's (aside from a few subforums) apolitical, the userbase is mostly made up of revlefters but I'd like to attract a few IronMarchers on so I can feel a bit more at home. The main draw is that the forum has several games running on it, like currently there's a simulation of 1920s Albania. Would it be cool for me to post a thread in general discussions so I can hopefully attract some fellow fascists who can hide their power level and want to play? </p>
