<p>Hey,</p>
<p>So a few days ago my friend was reading some book about Junger where one of his articles was referenced, and he asked me if I could find it. I remembered your thread and found it there and send it to him, I think its the only place it could be found. Either way, he liked it and asked me if we could transalte it into Serbian together, as he does a lot of book scanning and translating, he and a few other people had helped translate some major Guenons and Evolas works into Serbian. Recently we were translating some article by Ananda Coomaraswamy, an other traditionalist author, and we found the Russian version of that text and it helped quite a lot with our translation process, as he knows russian much better then english. </p>
<p>So my question is, do you have typed up russian version of the text "Our Stance" or did you translate straight from your book. If you have it in digital form, could you please send it to me, it'd help a lot. </p>
