<p>I'm voting Yes for various reasons. Our country is stagnating and people just can't understand why being "British" is ethnically inclusive anymore. There's a reason the National Front and the BNP are complete bollocks, and it's because you cannot be an ethnocentric party without a specific ethnicity to represent. The animosity towards the English felt by the general "Scotsman in the street" will never go away while we are united, and I want this to disappear so we can instead focus on the race issue. Look at National Action for example. they are doing a great job in England and people are genuinely excited about them because they are English, but we would need something different up here and it would never work as part of the UK. Once this all inclusive United Kingdom collapses it will leave behind countries that will grow more and more aware of themselves.</p>

<p>This of course, is only my opinion, I was actually going to be voting no until only last week.</p>
