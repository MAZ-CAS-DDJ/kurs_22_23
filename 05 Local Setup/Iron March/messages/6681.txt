<p>This could be because I am a woman, but I love the romance of the Third Reich. A people struggling to reclaim its godhood, attempting to purify itself and bring forth an everlasting white peace. I find the it to be so swiping. From the pageantry, to the uniforms, the architecture, and art. It all speaks to the power of the Aryan male and I adore it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What I find appealing about Aryan men is their confidence in their place in the world. They understand their duty is to guide, lead, protect, and fight. They are the rightful rulers and accept it.</p>

<p>I struggle with the idea of women in politics. Frankly I feel it is a realm for men only, but there have been many examples of competent female rulers and political leaders. I feel that it is best for a woman to influence through society, using the arts and culture as a way to produce the desires and needs of her Aryan brothers. I do feel a woman's role is important, but I don't think that women are equal to men. I know these are brief answers, but I did want to respond to you. Hopefully we can discuss this more in detail.</p>
