	Hey,
</p>

<p>
	Out of curiosity, do you have any advice on doing protests?  What works best, what should people look for when they are scouting locations, ect?  I have done a lot of poster/sticker stuff, but never a protest, so I have no clue what I am doing at the moment.

	Ollie and I talked over tox a few weeks ago, and he told me that I should think about talking to you.
