	I like both of them. I think the top one sticks out more. It's more striking because there are less elements to it. I only own an ironmarch flag sadly. I'd love one of the third reich flags but I haven't gotten around to it. I'm open about my fascism with everyone and even though my parents don't really approve I've gotten my mum to agree with me on a lot of points. Generally boomers are too far gone to even bother discussing these things with. Admitting that fascism is right would make most of their lives a waste and a mistake due to their inaction.
