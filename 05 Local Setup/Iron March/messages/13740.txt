	Usually, I'm booked for the entire week because of high school and such. Before 10 PM wont work. HOWEVER, ill be free almost all the time for the summer because Ill be home alone for the majority of the summer. If you wish to wait until then to meet, then that would work. Besides, things in Boston need to cool down before we try anything again.
