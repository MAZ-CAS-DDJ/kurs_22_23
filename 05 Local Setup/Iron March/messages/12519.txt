<p>Fed up with cafeteria Catholics? That makes two of us. I even know some who believe in reincarnation. There has been a question about the Jews, though, that's been plaguing me: If they've been a wandering, money-stealing race since forever, then why honour books of the Bible full of them, honoured by them, and in places written by them? What do you think?</p>

Thanks very much for the resource. That'll be better than risking being red-flagged at the library. Will definitely have to read Codreanu at some point. So many good books, so little time...</p>
