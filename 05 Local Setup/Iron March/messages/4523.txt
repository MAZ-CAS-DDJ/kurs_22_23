<p>I'm a capitalist myself; I don't mind international trade, what I am opposed to are open borders and freedom to peddle filth and ungodly ideas. Gary North has written a lot on capitalism being in harmony with Christianity. A lot of people have a bee in their bonnet with capitalism when what they should be blaming is cultural marxism which has made a sick synthesis of capitalism and socialism. The bible is clear that a man who does not work shall not eat, it is against idleness. I think you'd like Max Weber's <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</em> as well.</p>
<p>The bible is a guide book for everything. Sure you may not find mathematical formulas and guides to physics in there, but it is a book of overall wisdom that these things owe to Christianity and god. It even touches on taxes in the bible (anything over 10% is a tyranny).</p>
<p>Another one I'm not opposed to completely is distributism. Distributism is credited to the catholic church, but a form of distributism was present way before then in Sumeria. Class collaboration and knowing and fulfilling your role in the scheme of things was the traditional way and the way it should be, therefore I oppose the intellectualist and jewish idea of communism.</p>
<p>Here is my take on distributism:</p>
<p>If you are on good terms with your next-door neighbor, and you run short of some flour or eggs in the middle of cooking dinner, a neighborly thing to do is to go next door or send your children round to borrow what you need. After shopping, you repay the neighbor for the borrowed food. The act of borrowing among neighbors has been a traditional custom since people began living together in groups, even way before civilization.</p>
<p>Borrowing and repaying, is a way to build kinship and to sustain society. This act later became corrupted in Mesopotamia when the moneylenders came up with the idea of paying back more than you'd borrowed. Because of the moneylenders, men were no longer dependent upon their work for their material rewards in Life. Interest-on-a-loan created the inequality of those who became rich <strong>without actually working for their wealth*</strong> and those who became poor in spite of incessant labor.</p>
<p>Note, I don't hate the "rich" and I don't "hate" the poor, (which is also another biblical teaching) they all have their part to play. I'm not that fond of those who get rich without putting any work in. I'm not fond of poor welfare leeches and people who make victims out of themselves either.</p>
<p>In Mesopotamia goods were distributed in an equitable way. Mankind is a social creature who naturally makes loans to his fellows, this is observed throughout history. One day the hunt for game was not lucky for the family next door, so they would share in what their neighbor had caught that day. And when they were lucky in the hunt, they would share theirs with that same neighbor who had not been lucky or else share a basket of grain or acorns or berries. In this way, Mankind, as a social creature, was able to thrive through the power of mutual helpfulness and sharing. Making loans to one another and paying back, gave the entire tribe more resiliency and strength.</p>
<p>G.K. Chesterton wrote a lot about distributism as well. In my personal opinion though, distributism only works small scale amongst people in every day to day life. Amongst friends, we do it all the time, say someone doesn't have enough money, they'll get the drinks in this time and it'll be on that guy who didn't next time. It shouldn't be implemented as a macro economic policy imo.</p>
