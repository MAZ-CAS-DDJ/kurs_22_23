I would like to support their movement by buying some of the things offered at their store but it seems they only accept paypal, do they offer other ways to pay? Like with a credit card (and not having a Paypal account) also do they ship to the US?</p></div></div></blockquote>

<p>Hello, you might like to contact the NBU Leader, Gary Raikes to ask him about alternatives ways of paying for items in their store. I think they do ship worldwide including the US, with extra for postage.</p>
