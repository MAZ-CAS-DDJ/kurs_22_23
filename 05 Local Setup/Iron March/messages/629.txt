<p>You seem to be very interested in languages, if you are good into, it is a very good thing, we always need people wih some practical knowledge.</p>
<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I've always been deeply interested in philology, and over the last few years I have made unconcerted efforts to make this knowledge practical.  I am mainly interested in learning Germanic languages.  That being said I studied a bit of ancient Egyptian my last semester in college.  Like you said, it is nice to leave the Indo-European tree just to see what's out there.  Correct me if I am wrong, but you seemed to be a lover of languages as well.  How did this happen and what areas of linguistics or what languages family fascinates you the most?  </p>

<p>The National-Anarchists are close to my ideas.</p>
<p>But I can not believe in the principle of anarchy, the state seems necessary.</p>
<p>The experiments of anarchism all failed.</p>
<p>Anarchy may degenerate into anomie, in individual leadership, in open market, and there is no defense against foreign powers, I think we can not organize utopian national things like energy, transport, studies,. ..</p>
<p>We need a minimum of planning, coordination and guidance at least for the economy.</p>
<p>And individualism is a scourge of society, like the extreme opposite of being an ant in a state-weight, I prefer organic and intermediate vision.</p>
<p>Anarchists know that in the most realistic vision in terms of living standards, it will be like the 19th.</p>
<p>It may be quite a cyberpunk with anomic lifestyle and current demography.</p>

<p>I too spent some time as an anarchist, but one meeting was all I needed to see that those guys are more or less fine with anomie.  They wanted no social structure at all!  How is society to function?  Even chimps have a semblance of societal structure!  I think Joseph Gobbels said it best on 30 January 1933, "Today individualism dies."  While in many respects fascism is revolutionary, first and foremost we stand against the atomization of society.  The "oppressive" social roles of old gave us belonging and guidance.  Now, we don't need any ancient caste system, but if people realized how hedonistic and selfish their culture is and how rich and fulfilling history and tradition can be we'd no longer be society's bogey man.  We'd be its knight in shinning armor.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got off of topic a bit.  I am just passionate about individualism.  It is the sacred calf of this zeitgeist, and I am to slaughter it.</p>

<p>Hitler said that no one is better than a bad state, I agree.</p>
<p>I see the state as a tool, which must have an internal structure for organic does not degenerate into totalitarianism, I think, for example, against the powers, delegate everything that can be at the front: labor front, front housing, spiritual front, front policeman, who would be autonomous, and also to a control system of management and referendum of the citizens, as in Switzerland.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Nations are homogenous by nature and states that do not align with the reality of nations find themselves on a sinking ship or (at best) a ship diligently manned by opportunistic rats.  I believe it was Heinrich Mann who in 1919 wrote something to the effect of: a people love their nation even greater in defeat than in victory.  This I believe is the true test of whether a man's feelings are true nationalism or pathetic patriotism.  Any man can march behind an advancing flag, but only a true folkish comrade puts his national pride over his or even the community's material gain.  Therefore, I opposed immigration as it assaults the principal building block of a good, folkish nation-state: homogeneity.</p>
<p>I sympathize with your admiration of Switzerland.  Until my hard turn to the Right I was a great admirer of that confederation.  Truth be told, I still admire Switzerland, but whereas I used to see them as a model I now see them as a Alpine aberration.  Good breeding or something in the water (haha) have given them about two times the sense any other people have on average.  Is it possible that after the culture has reconnected with its roots and a folkish ethos permeates the people that they could be trusted with decision-making?  Maybe.  But I am more inclined to think that the lot of the average man is not to have a direct say in how his folk are lead.  Leave the business of ruling to rulers.  Whether a society's ideology accepts or not is immaterial.  The elites will reign.  The choice is either to muddle the culture with inherently individualistic ideas such as democracy or make the status of citizen something worth striving for. </p>

<p>Ah, I did not notice that your system was one without currency.  Don't you think that would be a bit impractical?  Currency isn't a Western invention.  Cultures all over the world independently developed some form of currency to expedite trade and make it easier to manage wealth.</p>

<p>I distinguish the pure traders as intermediaries with artisans who bring something (baker, bartender, butcher, artist, farmer, cook)</p>
<p>For the indo-european mentality, trades are not wise (physician, poet, priest, philosopher), combatant (warrior or kings), artisan / producer.</p>
<p>I noticed that the merchants breed them most of the time and form a caste inbreeding, they are genetically inferior, they spread a nomadic mentalitty because it is their livelihood</p>
<p>80% of traders are liberal according to statistics, more than twice that in the rest of the population</p>
<p>they would sell their mothers for profit.</p>

<p>In sentiment I agree with everything you said here.  But at the end of the day, no one environment satisfies the wants or needs of its inhabitants.  Even if we went back to nations eating their local, traditional cuisine and wearing garments made from animals now local to their land, how would Japan avoid serious famine and a massive deterioration in their standard of living?  How would Belgium, whose soil is richer in coal and iron than wheat and timber, eat and have shelter and how would my native Indiana, with its vast resources of corn and limestone, power our houses and build airplanes?</p>
<p>I guess I am being a little hard on you, and I apologize for that.  I know this is an ideal.  I'd just caution you about being too public with these sentiments.  While you and I agree that the reawakening of fascism is probably further off than most of the members of this forum like to think, we mustn't give our enemies the ammunition to call us silly dreamers or proponents of an ideology that "is great on paper, but falls on its face in real life."</p>

<p>I agree with all of this, and am a great admirer of pagan Germanic society.</p>

<p>Bah!  Nothing boils my blood like language extinction.  It is true that the Irish language (and the Celtic languages in general) have been assaulted by a vast array of external threats.  However, the destiny of a language lies first and foremost with its speakers.  They either cherish it and pass it on to their children (as was the case with you) or they become first-rate traitors of the folk and adopt the language of expediency and material gain.</p>

<p>It went well. I do not expect a guy in animal skin obviously, but a long-haired hippie with delusions, but no.</p>
<p>He was a director of Scientific Research (Centre national study does) so someone more "normal".</p>
<p>Quite interesting, quite to the left too, but rather an anarchist so no problem</p>
<p>We talked a little theology (ragnarok, freyja, the perception of the gods), about druidism, and about mutual friends, and have planned to perhaps organize 2-3 more meetings in the coming months: ceremonies, camping, ...</p>
<p>We also both laughed well.</p>
<p>See you soon.</p>

<p>Very interesting!  So what are his thoughts on multiculturalism?  I am always encouraged when I hear about pagans networking.  While I am no pagan yet, it is an honorable and noble tradition.  The world would be better off with more pagans.</p>
<p>Again sorry for being so critical in this message.  I very much like your ideas and think you a good folkish comrade.</p>
