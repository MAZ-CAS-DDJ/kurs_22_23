	Lel. Intro threads are apparently not the ideal places to discuss this kind of thing.<em><br /><br />
	&gt;but your premise that all religions are equally correct is false. </em>
</p>

<p>
	That isn't a premise I hold. Not all religions are equally correct, in fact many are straight up false.
</p>

<p>
	<em>&gt;As a Pagan or whatever you are you probably consider natural law to be God.</em>
</p>

<p>
	I don't believe that and I don't know anyone else who does. Where did you get that idea?
</p>

<p>
	<em>&gt;Natural law comes from God. All religions including those of our European ancestors did understand natural law.</em>
</p>

<p>
	Of course it does. Pre-Christian ancient Greek Philosophy went over it extensively, and it was understood by every educated Roman and Greek and as far as I know the Nordic/Germanic/Celtic faiths didn't write much down in the way of theology or philosophy so we can only <em>assume</em> what they believed about God and Natural Law, but based on what literally everyone else figured out (even shit-tier African tribes) I think it's safe to say they knew it just as well.
</p>

<p>
	<em>&gt;They could have come to the correct conclusions by understanding God through His creation (natural law), but they did not. </em>
</p>

<p>
	They could have and they did.
</p>

<p>
	<em>&gt;They, like every religion other than Christianity lacks a full understanding of God through the divine revelation of Jesus Christ, the Logos.</em><em> </em><em>We don't just arbitrarily choose to follow a religion that has Semitic origins. It just so happens that the religion which has the full truth comes from the eastern Mediterranean.</em>
</p>

<p>
	"Christianity is the only full truth religion because Jesus" is something that I would agree with if I was a Christian afflicted with <em>muh one true faith</em> syndrome but I'm not.
</p>

<p>
	<em>&gt;That fact alone doesn't matter though as I have said many times. It doesn't mean anything. The full truth could have come from anywhere, and it came from the eastern Mediterranean. </em>
</p>

<p>
	The full truth can be found in many religions and many esoteric practices from many parts of the earth.
</p>

<p>
	<em>&gt;Yeah every religion on the planet is just another way of understanding natural law based on the specific culture that the religion comes from, but they all lack the full truth that can only come from divine revelation. </em>
</p>

<p>
	It's possible to get Divine Revelation from other places than Christianity.
</p>

<p>
	<em>&gt;To even have a discussion about this you would have to accept the basic premise that God cannot be fully understood through human reason without divine revelation</em>
</p>

<p>
	God can't be fully understood by human reason but His Laws and the Nature of the Universe can. Divine revelation can be gleaned and has been gleaned by many non-Christian people practicing non-Christian faiths.
</p>

<p>
	<em>&gt;which I assume you don't so these discussions are always pointless. </em>
</p>

<p>
	You make a lot of poor assumptions based on little to no evidence.
</p>

<p>
	<em>&gt;It always just ends up as: Who can make a fancier post that ultimately accomplishes nothing and gets cheered on by the same exact Christians or Pagans of the forum. </em>
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately. I want to mend the divide and I do my best to bring reason from the "pagan" side but I don't think it's going to be possible to really get everyone on the same page. The only reason I'm responding is to attempt to educate you a bit about what non-Christians actually believe, because evidently you don't know as much as you think you do.
