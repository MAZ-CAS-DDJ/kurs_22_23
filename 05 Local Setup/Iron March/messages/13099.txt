	Fantastic to hear. I'd love to have a family myself so hearing about others, especially of our sort having families is grand.

	14 children! I thought I wanted a lot.Â

	I think that our sort should live fairly close by to each other, though I'm not sure of the location. I know a fellow who wants to start up a town in Western NSW, though that is a few years off at minimum. It's always good to have other people in your community not just your direct family; you can't always constantly look after every child, even the best parents need support. Do you have a mothers group you meet with?
