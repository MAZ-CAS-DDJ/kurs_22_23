<p>Good day, sir.</p>
<p>Since you are a Jew, I'd like to know your opinion on the poem published by GÃ¼nter Wilhelm Grass and the outrage it caused. You'll find it in the following thread:</p>

<p>I'd truly appreciate it if you respond either in the thread or in a PM.</p>
<p>Have a good day,</p>
<p>Imperator Dacus</p>
