	there is going to be an Antifa festival in fallowfield manchester on june 23-25 2017, called 0161 festival I was thinking of going there and disrupting it Cutting cables and wires generally making it a bad weekend for them or get it shut down by calling police saying drug dealing, stabbing, false fire. Antifa need a taste of their own medicine after shutting down that Black metal band.
