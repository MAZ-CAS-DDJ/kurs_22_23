	Golden Circle is an interesting idea. It'd be like another India. Although you'd better hope liberalism doesn't catch on among the whites lest they become another Brazil. Personally I'd prefer an ethnically homogeneous nation. When automation comes about the lower iq masses would be more a burden. Think how SA is supported quite a bit by a white minority.
