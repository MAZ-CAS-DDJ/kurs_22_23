<p>Cool. I'm not going until mid August but I'm probably only gonna be on here in the day when I can get a break at work up until September time. I'll level with you, I'm not a christian and have been using it as bait and the reasons I've set out in this exchange; better to have a few well intentioned idiots who are radicalized like CI than christian zionists. Been listening to the audio version of the Ford Translation Mein Kampf. Feels good on the ears, man, makes a nice change from reading. Every time I re-read that book I feel refreshed and secure; I can relate to nearly fucking everything in it. It amazes me how the most common arguments against Hitler along the lines of "hurrr Austrian, hurrr hated his father, hurrr reactionary, hurr poorly wrote" are dispelled straight away in the first chapter and second chapter of the first volume alone. I remember you saying something in a thread a while ago about you saying people say this because it wasn't written for them, something which Hitler himself says almost straight away. I know that most people who say that parrot the foreword written by Abe Foxman in one of the versions as well.</p>

<p>I sometimes get the feeling that Pierce and Rockwell were the only two who actually read MK all the way through when you look at the nationalist movements today. Hitler set the ground work and their philosophical principles AND explained them quite aptly enough in just the first 2 chapters, nevermind the rest of it; yet they are nowhere near as charismatic.</p>
