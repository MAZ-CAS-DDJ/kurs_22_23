	Hey Kulturkampf,
</p>

<p>
	Wasn't for sure if you got my previous message. So, here it is again. I forgot to ask (and kept forgeting to ask) if you would recommend a way to learn Italian? Like an app or computer program or something? They don't teach it at my university. Would probably have to be an app. Like Duolingo or something? Is that (Duolingo a good app? i.e. accurate) If you haven't herd of it just google it or look at the free app. Just want to know if it is accurate or not and that it actually teaches Italian. Can't afford Roseta Stone tbh
