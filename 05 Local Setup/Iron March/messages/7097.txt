<p>Sorry for the delayed reply. Bit manic here with work and trying to get this booklet finished.</p>

<p>I definitely agree that the drugs are substitute for the real spiritual experience and any experience I've had or seen others have has only ever been an extreme and violent amplification of what they already are or were going to be.</p>
<p>Interestingly I have held the exact same opinion for a long time, that drugs and particularly natural hallucinogenic compounds were for the ELITES only. </p>

<p>I'd be interested in the meetup, obviously we have a lot on this summer with meetings but I'd definitely like to meet everyone.</p>

<p>I found the subforum <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> I will get around to writing out exactly what I want to discuss and example workouts at some point tonight. I skimmed through your book work that you have published so far in the forum, really good stuff, I want to have a more in depth look at it all but if you're not certain of publishers etc. yet I'd be interested in talking about it.</p>

<p>Ha, getting Jack Donovan to commit to using the word Fascist these days is hard. He was really into the whole Ur-Fascism thing for a long time and he still talks about his anarcho-fascistic stance and definitely still holds that dream of the future, but I don't know, I think he's going down the organic farming and building shacks in the woods with dudes wearing fur route at the moment.</p>
