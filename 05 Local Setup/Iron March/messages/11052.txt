<p>Well we use a thing called noodle. Each student has an account on it. There was a public account last year that I signed into this year to see if it was still around, and didn't notice it wasn't public anymore and was an admin account. I gave the info to it to a friend in England for keks, and administration says he posted hitler and racist stuff on the page, sent it to teachers on the site, and changed pictures and things.</p>
<p>And I got blamed cause I wasnt allowed to prove this guy actually exists, so they blamed someone else who happened to be a close friend and punished us both. System is fucked.</p>
<p>Edit: Hit the wrong button when I was trying to edit the message and accidentally reposted it. Its not called noodle, its with an m and my phone refuses to let me type it.</p>
