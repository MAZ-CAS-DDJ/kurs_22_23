<p>Yeah- myself, I'm from a typical middle-class background, but spent most of my 20s working a bunch of blue collar jobs and most of my friends are people I met in that period. Helped ground me in a lot of ways when I decided to get my degree- a lot of middle-class kids go straight from school to uni, so they have no experience and happily eat up any bullshit they're fed. Luckily my current degree is pretty technical so I don't hear that stuff too often now- Information &amp; Library studies. Took Politics as an undergrad, which was often riddled with that shit as you said, but I've managed to wrangle a cushy public service job out of it earning decent dosh- previously worked as a cleaner so jumping through hoops and playing the game can work out, it just isn't a legitimate education to anyone with sense.</p>

<p>And yep, National Action- hugely impressed by them. I dunno how entirely accurate my recall on this is, but I recall a Voice of Albion interview where Eilthireach said they were partly inspired by the 80s Aussie National Actrion. Been reading up on them and yeah, a lot of similarities, although the UK one is way more competent. Can shoot you a couple articles if you're interested. And you know the really shitty thing- the only student groups even slightly <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-05/anu-investigates-claims-jewish-students-harassed/5300038" rel="external nofollow">getting close</a> to <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/thug-protesters-have-no-use-for-debate/story-fni0ffxg-1226926098840?nk=c26787d1d9d15670b3484094d5a85f5a" rel="external nofollow">being that ballsy</a> in Aus nowadays are Trots, which kinda shows the state things are in over here.</p>
