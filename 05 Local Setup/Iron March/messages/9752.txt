<p>Duolingo is really good for supporting real lessons, otherwise it won't get you much beyond the basics. It is better than Rosetta Stone or the other programs and free as well. Only problem is that it only has a few languages.</p>

<p>I am also slowly but surely learning my Italian. ZZA and all the other nonconforme bands really help, in fact the other day I was listening to Black Flag and understood the whole thing.</p>

<p>Tonight I am rather proud of myself, I was bored stiff and had the horrible and overwhelming urge to fap, but instead I listened to hatecore and did a lot of pushups. I'm NEVER entering that vicious circle ever again, being free for the past months has been great. </p>
