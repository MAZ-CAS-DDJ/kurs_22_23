	Hello friend, how's it been going with you?
</p>

<p>
	Happy birthday to our Führer! I came on Ironmarch to see if people were commemorating it and I'm glad they are. One day the entire world will start celebrating this day.

	I know, it makes me feel so guilty actually. To be honest, I had been so busy lately my perspective over time has almost collapsed. I had been gradually adding bits and pieces to my response over the past few weeks and I'm currently about 70% of the way through, but yeah, I wasn't even aware of how much time has passed. Truth be told, here's the real reason: basically, the desire to be more knowledgeable about the subjects we're talking about has inevitably driven me into a mad exploration of alchemy (since it looks like that's where a massive amount of our topics ultimately converge). Pretty much, I've suddenly gotten insanely obsessed with alchemy, and that's why I'm mentally stuck between accumulating further knowledge before responding versus just continuing the conversation normally as I go along with the study. I'll definitely go with the latter option of course, since it's such a huge topic that I definitely won't be done with it in a long time. But yeah, this alchemy stuff (plus IRL worries and everything) has slowed down/changed my progress through the response message, because it constantly has me editing stuff out or changing my ideas, etc. This exploration has actually almost changed my thoughts completely, going from a nationalist perspective to an even more fascist perspective: whereas before I was obsessed with being a fascist to serve Kurdistan, now I'm just obsessed with fascism for its own sake (it's like surpassing Christianity through itself --&gt; surpassing Nationalism through itself). So yeah, I'm having a strong ideological/worldview shift in the middle of all this, and that's why it's taking longer. But I'll definitely get back to you soon though, since I only have about 30% of the message left in the response.

	Other than that, I hope you're doing well too. Best wishes as always, and thanks for the reminder message! :D
