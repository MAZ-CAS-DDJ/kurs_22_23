<p>Hey, sorry for the delayed reply. My laptop's charging cable mysteriously stopped working last week and I've been using my iPhone to access the forums while I wait for the replacement cord I ordered to arrive, which gets somewhat tiring. Anyways, if you'd like I could go down the list of major issues I can think of (at least ones I've formed detailed positions on) and describe my positions on them, probably in an email or Facebook message if that's alright, since i dont acceas the forum on any shared computers. Would that give you a decent chance to see if collaboration would be worth a shot?</p>
