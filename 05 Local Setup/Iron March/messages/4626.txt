<p>Polygamy is allowed. However, so is divorce, and we can't say that that is ideal. In fact Yeshua makes this point:</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="1713" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Matthew 19:4-9<p><sup>4 </sup>He answered, “Haven’t you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,  <sup>5 </sup>and said, ‘For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?’  <sup>6 </sup>So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don’t let man tear apart.”</p>
<p><sup>7 </sup>They asked him, “Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce her?”</p>
<p><sup>8 </sup>He said to them, “Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so.  <sup>9 </sup>I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now he doesn't actually touch on Polygamy (which wouldn't have been an issue given it was illegal under Roman law anyway) but the message is there: Just because Moses allowed something, doesn't mean it was a good thing. The case can also be made that this passage supports polygamy, in that it is against splitting up, and polygamy is joining on (but note how he says 'his wife' singular).</p>
<p>Paul states, at least three times that Bishops and Deacons should be 'the husband of one wife' (1 Timothy 3:2, 3:12, Titus 1:6), in order that they be 'blameless' or 'above reproach', but I can't see any reason why that means your regular Joe-Christian can't marry Eve, Eva and Evelyn.</p>
<p>With regards to the actual social implications, since the Male:Female ratio is roughly 1:1 (I don't think we can put that down to coincidence - if polygamy was meant to be the norm then 1:3 etc. would be far more ideal), every wife a man takes above one is a wife taken from another man. Most people are not willing to die alone and would like to get married some day. If the wealthiest and most affluent males have taken all the decent wives you're going to have to look outside your own age-group. If you want polygamy completely legal, you're going to have to deal with the fact that 13 year old girls are going to be routinely married off to much older men.</p>
<p>On the other hand if you look at the passage you quote, immediately before it rules are given concerning a soldier taking captive an attractive foreign woman (that's right blanda upp) to be his wife. In that case no women have been taken from [your society] and you've not deprived anyone of anything.</p>
<p>Also: concerning pre-marital sex again, I did find this passage (this is the only clear cut passage I can find in the entire bible referring to pre-marital sex (hell looking very closely, I'm starting to think non-religiously affiliated prostitution is OK)):</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="1713" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Exodus 22:16-17<p><sup>16 </sup>`And when a man doth entice a virgin who [is] not betrothed, and hath lain with her, he doth certainly endow her to himself for a wife;</p>
<p><sup>17 </sup>if her father utterly refuse to give her to him, money he doth weigh out according to the dowry of virgins.</p>

<p>[Female] Virginity was prized in Israel, no-one ideally wanted to marry a non-virgin. If you take some guy's daughter's virginity you either have to marry her (because her chances of marrying now are slim) or at the very least give him the cash he would have got from a regular suitor (which is convienently £0 these days). This is paralleled in that a rapist who rapes an unbetrothed woman must marry her, because there is no way in hell anyone else is going to - condemning her either to a life of poverty or prostitution.</p>
