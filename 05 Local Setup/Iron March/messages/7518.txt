<p>Sounds like a good idea. </p>
<p>And yes. I saw them about two years back. National sinarquism is basically a Mexican brand if falangismt, it places more emphasis on the importance of Catholicism. There are some issues though. Most of the leaders are mestizo or indigenous, I have no problem with the members being such but I remain firm in my belief that it should be castizos/criollos leading the movement. They also have no paramilitary branch, something which is vital towards combating mexicos current  crisis. A True falangist would have declared war on Mexican narco-terrorist and their government sympathizers. Overall however I think the movement could be successful if it had better leadership and an armed paramilitary militia. I would also advise they combine with other nationalist groups such as the radical mexican nationalist front. Check out their points and tell me what you think. I plan to see them again this winter, lucky for me their headquarters are in my families home state. </p>
<p>Same here. Born and raised in America but I now identify myself a falangist. I haven't actually read it but I know a traditionalist friend who has.</p>
