	I see what you mean here, and I fully agree. Look, the Matthias Church in Budapest is not only great because it looks great, but because of the greatness (God/Truth) it is meant to embody. And this can be seen in all forms of art, and you can also notice that the more "medieval" (in attitude) something gets, the closer it becomes to this ideal of divine beauty (and I don't just mean in medieval Europe, but for instance you can the same principle in great Hindu temples too). And in fact, I think the phrase you used there summed up this whole topic, when you said: "it looks like a gap in reality." Yes! That's exactly what all of this boils down to: it looks like a gap in reality. The highest beauty looks supernatural, even if it's actually natural, because it embodies a sense of mysticism that's beyond logic or reason. (Interestingly enough, JS Bach believed the same thing about music as well, and it clearly shows in his best works. Listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b-VwSWx2Qw" rel="external nofollow">this piece</a> by him, and it's like a musical version of the Sufi recording you sent me.)
</p>

<p>
	Now, if this is "hedonism"… then, whoa, my mind is blown.
</p>

<p>
	This also reminds me of the image of a medieval village that would build their church as the House of God, so they'd put their heart and soul into it so much that their hard work would be above all logic and reason, and thus everyone who goes into it would be able to see that this church is a "gap in reality" and they'd be certain that this is indeed a House of God. Compare this to the most "important" modern buildings (office buildings, skyscrapers made for insurance companies and banks, etc), and it's clear that no thought or care is ever put into any of it, because they themselves know that they're full of shit. (Hitler mentions this in Mein Kampf too, where he compares the public buildings of the Classical Era, alongside the sacred buildings of the Medieval Era, and then notes how compared to them modern buildings and cities are just soulless monstrosities.)

			Look up Epicurus, his concept of Ataraxia, and the story of his death.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Hmm, okay, I'm confused again. I mean, I don't know, man. I always thought of Epicurus as one of those autistic "fedora atheist" types from what I've read about him, so I went and rechecked his wikipedia page to see if maybe I was confusing him with someone else. Now, his death story is indeed very admirable, and in fact it's already making me question everything else I've read about him so far. But I'm still struggling to understand how this Epicurus (who faced his death so honorably) is the same Epicurus that I've always heard about from autists and atheists.
</p>

<p>
	You know, this could be due to wikipedia doing its usual kikery, but… it really makes Epicurus look like a total faggot when it describes his beliefs. Just look at what says about him:
</p>

<p>
	<u>"He taught that pleasure and pain are measures of what is good and evil"</u>
</p>

<p>
	(In other words: seek pleasure like a degenerate and avoid pain like a coward, and never inflict pain on others.)
</p>

<p>
	<u>"death is the end of both body and soul and should therefore not be feared"</u>
</p>

<p>
	(In other words: enjoying this life is more important than making sacrifices for the future.)
</p>

<p>
	<u>"the gods neither reward nor punish humans"</u>
</p>

<p>
	(I mean, that's no different from John Lennon's bullshit. "No heaven above us, no hell below us, blah blah.")
</p>

<p>
	<u>"the universe is infinite and eternal"</u>
</p>

<p>
	(In other words: "dude, we're totally just like tiny specks on a pale blue dot flying in space, yo.")
</p>

<p>
	<u>"and events in the world are ultimately based on the motions and interactions of atoms moving in empty space."</u>
</p>

<p>
	(In other words: nothing matters, we're all just space dust.)
</p>

<p>
	Epicurus also has that whole "problem of evil" reputation that atheists constantly bat around in their masturbatory arguments against God. 
</p>

<p>
	That's the type of philosopher I reject before I even begin reading him, since I'd be like, "Eh, if these are his beliefs, he's not even worth wasting time on." But now, I don't know… was I wrong? I mean, like I said, his death story is the complete opposite of what an autistic type of person would say. But still, those are way too many red flags for any philosopher. I know we might as well be linking to wikipedia's page on the Holocaust to see how it's so full of shit, but that's a big modern topic. Could wikipedia and everybody else have actually gotten this ancient philosopher so backwards and wrong too? The word "ascetic" doesn't even appear once on that page. Is there some other (completely reversed) explanation of what Epicurus wrote about?

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's an interesting point, since it's not precisely accurate, but it does bear a great element of truth. I should probably add some of those Hungarian guys to my reading lists too, although I couldn't find much about them in English aside from a few small things by Hamvas. I suppose these are the writers popular with the Jobbik types? And by the way, I was wondering what your thoughts were on Jobbik in general. Do you help out with the effort?
</p>

<p>
	Now, regarding that point itself, it's actually one of the major reasons why I argue that Islam stands in the way of Kurdish (or any non-Arabic) nationalism: it's because if things had gone some other way, the Arabs could have actually exterminated us completely, just like they did with most of the other non-Arabic peoples of the Middle East, simply via linguistic displacement. Islam is (or perhaps was) a powerful tool for linguistic displacement. Only us Kurds and the Persians survived that huge assault from the Arabic language, as it was pushed on us by the Quran's emphasis that Arabic is the holy language in which Allah sent his last words to the world. (The Turks don't count, since they came to the region much later and chose Islam of their own will, which made things easier for them.) But yeah, it's good that you've preserved those pieces of Hungarian history, because it's much easier to return to Tradition when you actually have a link to the past that you can feel and touch and see by yourself. Even if it's not fully understandable due to the aforementioned linguistic involution, at least it's there, still binding you to the far distant past.
</p>

<p>
	What's also interesting is that this is one area where a nationalist from the Middle East would have a very different experience compared to one from Europe. European nationalists focus mostly on blood, sometimes to the detriment of language. But for Middle Easterners, it's the opposite: they focus mostly (almost obsessively) on language, sometimes to the detriment of blood. This is an issue we've been trying to fix, so us Kurdish nationalists are focusing on blood first and language second (in our propaganda, activism, etc).

<p>
	Holy shit! How have I not heard about that village before? Lol, that's some crazy history right there. It's also funny how things have turned around: whereas before we used to cooperate with the Turks against the Balkan and Slavic areas, nowadays it's the Kurds and Slavs and Balkans who need to cooperate against the Turks. (Although, hilariously enough, despite reading hundreds of articles about the Balkans, eventually I always keep forgetting and losing track of who hates whom, who fights whom, who has a grudge against whom, etc etc. The only fact I consistently remember is the hostility between Greece and FYROM. Everything else I have to look up depending on the situation, especially when it has to do with Bosnia and Serbia and whatever the hell is happening over there, lol.)
</p>

<p>
	By the way, I actually hate tricolor flags, since they came out of the French Revolution. I dunno, I don't think we should be using a tricolor in Kurdistan, since it looks too bourgeois and materialistic. I guess we need a whole new conception of flags too, lol.

	Yeah, I remember you mentioned something like this in the introduction thread. But do you mean "idealists leading armies of materialists against other/lesser idealists who are leading their own armies"? Or do you mean "idealists together against all the materialists"? The former would be interesting, but the latter could be even more fascinating. At first thought, I imagined that the materialists would win by sheer force of numbers. But again, I'm not sure how this all plays out on the spiritual and metaphysical level.

<p>
	In Western Kurdistan, we don't really have much of a chance, just as we don't have any chance in any of the other 3 isolated regions. I've analyzed the geopolitical situation to hell and back. It's basically impossible for a Kurdistan to exist without all 4 pieces uniting together, since any 1 piece would be so isolated and weak that it could be restricted and locked and and destroyed very easily. Even a united Kurdistan would be hard to maintain, since it would need to wage war against both Iran and Turkey at the same time, while also protecting itself against Baghdad and Damascus. This is also another reason why I have so much admiration for National Socialist Germany: because they were in a really similar situation, and yet they still prevailed for a long time and even managed to create Heaven on earth. I wish we could achieve something similar. 
</p>

<p>
	Now, I have zero hope for Rojava because it is controlled by Marxist morons who believe that the state must be abolished and that centralization is the most evil thing in the world. Of course, they might turn out to be bluffing, and they might create a highly centralized state like the Soviets (who worshipped decentralization while being extremely centralized), but for now we can't be sure which direction they will take. (Hilariously enough, in one interview, the leader of the PKK literally said: "Our aim is national and social." When I read that, I had to do a double take, because you don't see those two words side by side outside of fascist forums that often. I was like: "Is it just a slip of the tongue? Or is he actually trying to send a hidden message, like a wink or something?" Honestly, I still don't know to this day, but my hunch tells me it was just a slip of the tongue.)

	This actually just reminded me of a few thoughts I had on modern feminism and the Traditional natures of men and women. I kept thinking to myself that if men are solar and women are lunar, then would feminism be a reversal of this? Would feminism be a product of saying that men are lunar and women are solar? But then it hit me: no, that would be some other retarded ideology like egalitarianism or whatever. But feminism is in fact a whole different beast: it is a total rejection of the whole solar/lunar Truth. Feminism is when you say that there is no such thing as solar or lunar in the first place, thus destroying the entire structure, as you mentioned. Capitalism does a similar thing, but from an economic perspective. At least communism has that (misguided) sense of idealism. But capitalism just destroys the inner structure of idealism completely, such that everything becomes a matter of money and nothing else is important. This just does irreparable damage to the soul.

<p>
	Yeah, the underlying philosophical conception is similar to Hinduism, whereas the Zoroastrian elements are more symbolic. And of course, there is some overlap too here and there, with Zoroastrian concepts and Hindu symbols sometimes occurring as well. And hell, there are even some small elements taken from ancient Sumer, which only God knows how they even got here, lol. (The explanation popular with the more fanatical nationalists among us is that those Sumerian elements actually travelled the other way around: that is, Kurdish Aryans established Sumerian culture, and then imbued it with Kurdish symbols, and then people ended up thinking those Sumerian symbols ended up in Kurdistan, whereas it was always the other way around after all. Or so the thinking goes.)

	Well, we have to be careful again, since this is similar to the whole esoteric/exoteric religion issue. This could easily become like a semi-spiritualized version of American mentality. "Oh, we accept and welcome everyone, so long as you share our spirit." Perhaps the same conclusion applies here as well: teach classical racism to the masses, but the leadership will understand the truth of spiritual racism.

	Regarding our own problem in Kurdistan, I suppose a combination of integralism and eugenics could work together: integralism for the near future, while eugenics would be for the far future. Again, it's a complex issue, and I'll also have to continue the research into the origins of much of the Iranian populations to make sense of what I see around me. But yeah, I'd definitely appreciate those extra reading materials you mentioned, since I'm always expanding my library, lol.
