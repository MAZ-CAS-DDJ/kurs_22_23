	We are probably the biggest serious organization that could truly be called Fascist in America today. In Texas we are small, as the previous leadership here let our activity die off after the League started moving away from the constitutional-libertarian stuff it was founded on; we haven't had a State Conference since 2013. However the national organization is alive and well, and as the new State Chairman for Texas I am working to make the League one of the most ideologically solid and reliable-on-the-ground groups in the state. We focus on a mix of traditional activism and training, prepping, and community-building in preparation for actions to secure the Wellbeing and Independence of the Southern People.
