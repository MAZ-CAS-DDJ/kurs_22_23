	Dear friend,<br /><br />
	Since I don't know you or your friend, I am sorry to say I can't empathize over your sorrows, but there is someone who always will cry and empathize with you on <strong>every single one of your</strong><strong> sorrows</strong>: God. 100% promise you this.<br /><br />
	About your question, of course I will answer your question friend. But <em>you must know some things before making that decision</em>, and I would like to know a few things about you and your decision (if you do not mind). It is a very serious thing that you are considering and willing to do, so it might take a few sending back and forth of messages between days and hours.<br /><br />
	Race or not, I care about your sorrows and will to truth, so do not hesitate to pm if you need help in any way.<br /><br /><em>What you must know:</em><br />
	1. The life of a Christian is very hard and full of sorrows, but God will be with you on every step of the way. He Loves you like a Son. Like actually loves you, like a mother and father cares for their child. <br />
	2. The Christian Life is not merely a religion, it is something very serious, not to be taken lightly, it a familial relationship with God, the Truth incarnate himself. <br />
	3. Who God is, why he came to earth, and why on earth he cares about us bumbling degenerate fools (humans).<br /><br />
	Do you know about number 3?
