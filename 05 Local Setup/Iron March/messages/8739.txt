<p>That's a bad feeling, when someone's words and actions don't match up enough. Makes you question how much you really know them.</p>
<p>Re: Europe. Yes, exactly. A Mexican has a claim to this land about as much as I do. It's very, very beautiful, but it's not mine. I could conquer it, but I could never possess it in the pure way. And the weather sounds awful, I love cold. Could almost make Sweden worth it, but... No.</p>

But he hasn't encountered trouble in his life yet, until now. Good family, money, stability... He thought he wouldn't care about suffering, that he could face it, but it didn't turn out that way. He tells me not to blame myself, that he is the problem and I was more than he deserved... I don't know, sometimes with depression there comes a self hatred, a self sabotage. That's the only way I can explain this.</p>
