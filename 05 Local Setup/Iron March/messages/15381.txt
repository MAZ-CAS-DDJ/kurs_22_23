	Sounds fine then, you won't be overdoing it too much. Take care of your body if it's injured. I tend to still persist but since I do calisthenics there's far less of a chance of me actually doing damage. With lifting weights you can hurt yourself badly.

	Doesn't have to be outright fascists but if you can find people that accept your worldview they can turn over time. Either way you don't need to involve everyone you meet with politics. Especially women. You don't even need to find a fascist girl, just a girl that's morally decent regardless of politics and over time if you are a man to her, she'll fall into your view and start to like what you like. The idea of online dating isn't a good one honestly. It's better to avoid it if you can. We all want a perfect wife but that's not easily obtainable, especially online. Try to remember that as a man your value only increases as you age, up to mid to late 30s. The value of women decreases as they age. I'm not actively trying to find a girlfriend but if one suddenly appeared I wouldn't reject it. Gotta make sure you're worthy of a good girlfriend before you try to get one. Varg has a few videos on that topic actually. such as:

	Online dating is really just a last resort when you're older and haven't gotten anything. If you plan to live your life as an adventure (as you should), it'll come together as time goes on.

	No need to worry about me talking about private discussions with anyone. I'm not that type of person and I would assume you're not either. Gossip and chatting behind peoples backs is for faggots, not men.

	I have that book by Mishima. I'll let you know how it is when I'm finished with it if you'd like.
