<p>Well, I could turn up at whatever events the local EDL decide to hold but they're often woefully disorganised and poorly attended.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for leaflets, they'd work far better than posters, in my opinion, because posters don't tend to stay up very long; the local brats are well-known for even tearing down ones for missing cats. I could give that Library idea a shot, which leads me to the idea of local issues. We have a good speaker's corner here (which usually attracts some attention), if you could think of any thing in that regard.</p>

<p>Lincoln is quite small but there are two big issues at the moment to do with government cuts; firstly, they want to close down the libraries and, secondly, they want to turn the city's prison into an immigration centre (for detaining asylum seekers and the like). They <em>could</em> be capitalised on but, as I've seen with the libraries, it's only really the busybodies and students that seem to give a shit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for artistic talent, I'm afraid I have none, which is a shame because there are a number of horrific looking graffiti tags around my local area, one of which exclaims: "DURGS (sic), WE SELL!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm sure I could get down to Boston once in a year and I'd be more than happy to attend any local anti-austerity protests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I can make enough money by October then I'd be more than happy to head down to London.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for what I could do now... anything really. And, just as an aside, I've got a meeting with my MP on the 6th of September on the basis of pitching Social Credit to him but I could easily add in a few other things if you'd like.</p>
