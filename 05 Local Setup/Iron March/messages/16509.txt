	So I can guess from that one word you're asking me if I want to live in the Northwest or what i think of the northwest, well I think its a liberal hellhole with a lot of fags. Although there are some small towns that might be okay I don't know I've only ever been to the Seattle airport only because I was trying to get home from Arizona and the flights were full for a direct flight.Â
