<p>Sorry to shit up the point of your discussion blokes just wanna ramble a bit whilst I've got your attention, </p>
<p>Nice one Quis, if your ever over in the south west I'll take you fishing down here, since Slavros wants to see fascist outdoor adventure type stuff, I'm sure we can lead the charge in the aquatic adventure side of things, wouldn't mind starting a thread for that somewhere... Spearfishing, diving and fishing. Where are you anyway Quis? </p>
<p>I don't see why Australian Action couldn't be used to describe an iron march Australian chapter, modelled on National Action but linked back to IM. </p>
<p>Say on items of propaganda, include the AA name with Ironmarch URL beneath it, so as to have further educational continuity to our propaganda, which in itself should include the usual nationalist anti-internationalist rhetoric but also a stab at the spiritual rot whilst being clever by not sanctioning race hate laws upon us. </p>
<p>Again I think NA do this brilliantly, they don't necessarily entice racial hatred/loathing but bait people and give the roman salute to solidify their sentiments without being outwardly taken down by authority's...this way we can model campaigns with an Australian slant but in a iron march context. </p>
<p>Any of you boys heading to the Reclaim Australia rallies? It only just dawned on me the small potential for spreading IM propaganda amongst slightly awakened Australians, I think there on today so no chance for me at work. I have a few ideas for Anzac Day activism but may ask in a new conversation so I don't shit this one up any more.</p>
<p>Cheers </p>
