<p>Fair point- that's one of the reasons I can't stand Kacen. He was the first I contacted on here, and everything about his personality is ubermenschen. We do need to challenge ourselves to contact the outside world. Unfortunately, extroverts are less insightful and more prone to the bombardment of multiculturist propoganda. The best example I can suggest is Jake; he, atleast, is geting out there.</p>
