<p>Hey, so i don't know if you saw but right now I'm sort of fucked. My laptop got confiscated by the school and found IM and le evil nazi stuff all over, and was expelled</p>
<p>I got expelled for "hacking a school website" though</p>
<p>Anyway</p>
<p>My mother is forcing me to meet with a rabbi and counselor and I was wondering if you could delete the posts in trivial happenings from me, that say "delete"? I posted information that could reveal my identity on ironmarch to someone who knew me in real life, if they were reading it. It'd help alot</p>
