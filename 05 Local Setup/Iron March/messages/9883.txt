<p>Really? Most of the Italians I've met arent really racist but they seemed pretty racially aware. How bad is immigration in Italy? I know thats where most of the boat-muslims go to but how receptive are the people compared to England?</p>

<p>Honestly I have never met a Roman Pagan so I don't really know but I've heard its pretty larpy. Despite being the most fanatic pagan you'll ever meet on the street I really hate the majority of Pagans. Most of them became Pagan because of rebellion against mainstream white, Christian society, not out of reactionary beliefs or a strong conviction to their culture. Most of them should be seen as race traitors for daring to defile such ancient lore with their liberal nonsense. Wiccans deserve to be sacrificed to Wotan. Germanic Pagans seem to be the best ones because all the Nazi-ish symbolism scares away the SJW's and it attracts farmer types and former Christian conservatives, which is exactly the kind of people we want. Celtic Paganism is in a pretty sorry state though. </p>

<p>I love being Pagan but I'm probably going to settle with a Christian girl. My odds of finding an attractive white girl with my beliefs are much higher if I look in that area. The only white Pagan girls in my area are degenerates. As long as my wife lets me raise my children with the myths and history of their people I don't mind them being Christian; its better that they have a community anyways.</p>

<p>What is Casapound? I'm not too familiar with fascist happenings in Italy. </p>

<p>The only Jew I've ever tolerated isn't really even a Jew, her mother is German but she adopted the Jewish religion (or at least thats what she claims) and she looks pretty non-Jewy. I'm not sure if I really trust her but shes pretty open with me and doesnt seem to have the traits most other Jews have, but I still watch what I say. Most Jews I fucking hate, I lived with a Jewish woman in Alaska and that cemented most of my thoughts on them. She fought with a waitress over ten cents, crashed into someones car in line for a coffee house because they cut her off and she wrecked my truck my driving it when it had no tranny fluid because she was gonna lose her job. Every stereotype is true, not to even mention her fucking looks </p>

<p>Its all good man I sperg on about Hitler alot. I believe he's the chosen of Wotan and I cried the first time I read Mein Kampf. </p>

<p>I haven't read all of Duce's works yet so I can't judge but I was pretty moved in his autobiography when he talked about America. I was surprised to learn how much he admired America and identified with the Italian population there. </p>
