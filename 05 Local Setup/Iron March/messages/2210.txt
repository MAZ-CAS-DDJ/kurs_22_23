<p>I hope that Torren will accept the duel. I am sure that (in a fair fight,) you would win. Now it only matters if the community does not 'influence' the duel.</p>

<p>This guy sounds like a troll, and little else. For some reason he challenged my disapproval of racialism with a PM, and when I said I'd be happy to discuss it openly in the boards, he kinda got butthurt/passive-aggressive.</p>
<p>I'm starting to have my doubts in him accepting the duel: he's already dancing around the issue of giving a clear answer. I however hope he will accept - I might enjoy some light exercise :-)</p>
<p>The likes of Slavros or NSP could best me in a duel, but there are fair chances this Amazing Nerd would just throw a tantrum for everyone to see, unable to take my sarcasms with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for your support.</p>
<p>Hails, WiB</p>
