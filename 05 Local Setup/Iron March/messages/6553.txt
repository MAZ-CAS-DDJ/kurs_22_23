<p>I understand completely what you're saying about Hitler, believe me I do, but the cult of Hitler as opposed to the analysis of Hitler the politician is not something left to discuss among the children. He failed, he lost, we lost with him, some of it was his fault. You and I are both Christians I suspect, and partly because Hitler wasn't exactly the Altar boy of his youth, the non christian element of NS sympathizers look to him as a heroic demigod all the more heroic because he died in such a 'romantic' way. In other words, modern faggotry is what we're fighting here, even here. He would loathe this element more than we do I think. I'm hanging in here, I'm looking for the grownups though, and I think you're one of them.</p>
