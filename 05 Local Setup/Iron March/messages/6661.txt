<p>Not sure how i sound like Jeffcoat? Lol, he's anti-nationalist, if i'm not mistaking. Don't get me wrong, i respect the guy, but our ideologies are definitely not the same. </p>

<p>And yes, that is a possibility that you might be "The American", but as long as it's in good fun, and they're not actually looking down on you for it, who cares? I have one very close friend, he's half beaner, and i call him a spic, beaner, etc. All the time, and he calls me a cracker. It's all in good fun, you know? He's a good guy, he agrees with me about hating niggers, etc. And he tells me all the time he wishes he could just find a good Mexican lady to be with. Even though he's "The Beaner", and i'm "The white boy", we're still close friends, and i'd honestly have his back in any situation. All i'm trying to say is, joking among friends is one thing, but as long as they genuinely have your back and respect you, it's really no big deal. </p>

<p>And no kidding, i honestly hope the day comes when someone can unite this nation and lead it on the path to glory. We have everything we need to be a very glorious nation, we just lack national unity, and strong leadership. </p>
