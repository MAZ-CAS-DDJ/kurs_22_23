<p>Haha bears are my favourite animals too, my favourite number is 26 though. I like your nickname, it's creative, it's just that I didn't have a clue what it's supposed to mean. We have quite a lot of bears here, in fact we have 500 brown bears, the largest European population outside Russia. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whl8oFtrIxk" rel="external nofollow">Here</a>'s a video, this is how they look like. We sent some bears to countries like France and other European countries because they're almost extinct there.</p>

<p>Well we had all sorts of activism during the last years, wouldn't really like to go into details on the internet. I'll put it this way, most of all we're just a big group of radical right people who hang together and have sticked together through the years, and that's the most important part of "activism". Right now there's not much to do, we can only wait for a Golden Dawn scenario in our countries and be prepared.</p>

<p>I was invited to Iron March Skype group so I made a new Skype account, I can add you if you want. It's more convenient to chat there and I can help you with learning Croatian easier. I understand if you don't want to add me though, if you have a profile with real name and all that.</p>

<p>As for the new generations, I don't know. If you take a look at how liberal and marxist education is already in primary schools, kids simply don't hang out much today, most of them simply aren't ready to become part of something fascist/traditionalist. We'll already have to do something before they grow up, otherwise we might as well die out.</p>

<p>For me, the 90s were still the best post war years, as one other member here put it ("Hitler was a sensitive man"): "The 80s were too soft, the 70s didn't do enough to help themselves when they had carte blanche to do so and the 60s and 50s fucked it for everyone. I think most people living through the 90s have a desire to go back there, otherwise the best of 90s music cds and the 90s ministry of sound mash up CDs wouldn't sell so well nor would the TV shows of the 90s be the most viewed vids on youtube." I really have big hopes for the generation raised in 90s, 00s were ok too. Everything really started going downhill around 2008.</p>
