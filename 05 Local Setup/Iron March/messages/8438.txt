<p>Hey man I was wondering if I could ask you a question. I know you mentioned in some posts that you teach English on the side in Korea. I have been thinking of doing that for a term or two in the future, and I was curious as to the certification requirements. Do you have any experience with TEFL/CELTA and their standing for teachers in Korea? Some websites say an online TEFL is enough, but others suggest going for the CELTA program.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
