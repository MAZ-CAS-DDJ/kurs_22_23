<p>As do I! To hold those warm little sweet ones is the best feeling.</p>
<p>You will have my presence and readership as long as I have internet access, dear!</p>
<p>Oh, they are the wonderful people. I think of them like my own children. I can't wait to have a family of my own. I watch them go from fat sleepy newborns to big, strong, happy babies who walk and yell at chickens. Every morning when I come in they light up and hug my legs and say how they missed me. They bring me bugs and flowers and ask me to kiss their owies. They tell me silly stories about their life at home and color me pictures. I love them so much. I love to kiss the fat baby bellies and make them laugh, I love to dance them around the room so thy squeal with joy! The are the light of my life.</p>
