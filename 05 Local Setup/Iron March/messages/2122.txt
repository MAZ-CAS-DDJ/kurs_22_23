<p>I wanted to keep my promise by not replying in the Jew Thread, but you said some things in it that interested me and were worthy of a response. And since you were one of the more thoughtful posters I wanted to reply somehow. Also because some of your post confused me.</p>
<p>If the healthy part of Christian values are compatible with the German, are they not one in the same?</p>
<p>I would have to ask you what you think German values are.</p>
<p>If German values are industry, production, and innovation, then Jewish secular culture has always been this. Austrian emperors such as Franz Joseph preferred Jews in business over others because he knew they had been good for the empire.</p>
<p>I cannot deny the massive contribution Judaism has made to German culture. Or that German Jews are partly responsible for the existence of Germany in the first place.</p>
<p>When people mention Jewish values and "German" values, they confuse me. Especially since secular Jewish culture in Germany has always considered itself German, just not Christian German.</p>
<p>It went so far that German Jews thought they were superior to any other group of Jews. Often Jewish non-Germans were discriminated against by German Jews.</p>
<p>Being German and being Jewish were never mutually exclusive. This is a concept invented by radical National Socialists only, and was often opposed by Germans in Austria, Switzerland, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the knowledge of history for many non-Germans ends with Hitler. Many do not know, for example, that many Germans considered themselves Prussian or Bavarian (not German)--as Austrians today consider themselves Austrian. Or they forget Deutschland was a political union of states.</p>
<p>People did not agree as much then on what a German was as they do today.</p>
<p>When the states were unified, being a German was a somewhat new idea. And German values a vague concept.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm, when I think about Germany and Christianity I think Lutheran and Protestant values. When I take into account the knowledge I've gleaned from our conversations, I come to the conclusion that 'The German Character" so to speak is a composite of Protestant/Catholic/Jewish tendencies along with what composed the Reich regionally. It is actually making me think a bit differently about Hitler, maybe he should have just purged all dangerous elements from all religious spheres while integrating Jews, Austrians, Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox. He may have not had the chance, but maybe today's Germans do.</p>
<p>What I quote here has really refreshed my thinking about that area of Europe, I'm sorry if I pretended to know more then I do about Germany.</p>

<p>But mostly I do not understand how if I were Christian this would be considered German without question.</p>
<p>Even though I find mainly non-Germans think German Jews are less German than German Christians. Most real nationalistic Germans today are proud of the long list of German Jewish scientists, doctors, and otherwise geniuses that advanced and continue to advance Germany even today. Because they were German.</p>

<p>Well my thinking is coming around to this. I suppose from here on out a Jew for me is going to be a religious Jew. So I have to say, IMO, you're just a German.</p>

<p>No, I think I just need to free myself from constantly applying the stereotype.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="638" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div><p>I feel this may be the case when I see mentions of "Talmud" and Pharisee. Many Jews don't use a Talmud. They reject it as legitimate. For example, Karaite Jews.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if the Nuetura Karta (obvious misspelling!) would be considered Kararite Jews. Although I'm still convinced that aspects of the Talmud have seeped into wider Jewish culture. Not to say that it isn't something that could be dealt with internally.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="638" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Also "Talmudist" and Pharisee are meaningless words.<p>If you want to refer to Jews like that, then I think you are referring to either Orthodox or Hasidim.</p>
<p>But most Jews are not Hasidic or Orthodox.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I guess Talmudist would be, while Pharisee is simply outdated. If the spiritual descendants of the Pharisees are a minority, then I shouldn't worry about too much about Jewish Supremacy being driven by a religious base.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="638" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>As for my Jewishness.<p>I resent that if I were Christian, this would be a non-issue. I also consider this to be nonsense. As far as actual religion goes, Judaism is more logical than Christianity is anyway. Christianity is built on self-contradicting truths. So the pro-Christian argument for being German is absolute nonsense to me.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Well this goes back to a Jewishness by religion, race, or culture. And I'm going to settle on Jew by Religion.</p>
<p>As for your assessment of how logical Christianity is, I'm just going to dismiss it, since you're an atheist.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to be an asshole, I just don't want to go down the road of explaining why Christianity is the sum of all spiritual truth that has been revealed throughout history.</p>

<p>Well I don't think you should be sorry in saying that, because I'm not sorry when I say that I had to struggle through ignorance in order to recognize the world for what it is. And even talking with you is part of that struggle.</p>

<p>Still doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Only Jewish secular culture is materialistic. As is all secular culture--although secular Jews may be better at it than secular Christians.</p>
<p>Jewish religious culture suggests owning things is a bad thing, and that charity is more useful. The Christian monk aesthetic is a Jewish aestheti</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I don't entirely disagree, but any religious culture can descend into materialism. For example, I see the neo-pagans who lack the esoteric view as very materialistic. When comparisons are made between Christ and Thor I laugh my ass off.</p>

<p>I consider Christians a race in that way too.</p>
<p>So ok.</p>
<p>I know people in my family who would argue moreover that Catholics are often anti-German and representative of foreign Italian/Roman/Vatican power.</p>
<p>And yet I am willing to accept German Catholics as German, although some Jews in my family consider them completely non-German and instead dedicated to Roman Catholic power.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>True, this is another example of where I see complications with having total allegiance to one's own Nation.</p>
