<p>You don't sound like a complete moron- at least less so than the other <em>muh classical fascism</em> shits we get normally. Otherwise I wouldn't bother messaging. You actually need to read the <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/5131-registration-introduction-guidelines-up-to-date-as-of-121115/" rel="">intro materials</a>. Specifically the IM originals and the Next Leap.</p>

<p>Drop the "stop arguing with me" shit. That won't help you. This isn't a circlejerk forum where we tell everybody they have a valid opinion. Our purpose here on Ironmarch is to hone our worldview into a consensus. Since you are a newcomer you need to actually catch yourself up to where we are at before you start trying to inject your own views since these are all topics we went over three years ago.</p>
