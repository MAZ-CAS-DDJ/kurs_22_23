	Alright nice. With me it is mostly Legionarii, Arditi, Triarii, and Von Thronstahl. I have a lot of CD's btw lol. Also, probably won't reinstall Steam by the way, it is a was of time and money. And I would rather spend my time reading and working out. Oh btw, what is your opinion on the metal band Amon Amrath?
