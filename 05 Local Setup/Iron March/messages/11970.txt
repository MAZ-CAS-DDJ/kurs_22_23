<p>Yeah hit me up whenever you want, I'll tell you how I feel further on. I know the ending, and have watched ahead to see only that history episode. I would absolutetly side with the Empire, and if I got disappointed in it like Reinhardt, I wouldnt fight against the noblity but try to reform it, try to make them have honor again. The show isnt really pro nobility either, but it doesnt make them into evil cartoon villains. So far only two nobles have been shown as noble in heart (three if you include Reinhardt), the big fighter guy and the guy who wanted to stay when that planet was surrendered to the republic by reinhardt</p>
