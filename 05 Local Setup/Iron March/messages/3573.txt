<p>Josh I really hope you arn't messing around but you don't seem willing to defend Richard or his actions - you are aware people here have made many criticisms and accusations against him yet not only in the last thread but in general you are not willing to discuss it. for instance, if I knew that richard was not using sockpuppet accounts and parties  I would defend him. The fact his friends are here but are not defending him is incriminating.</p>
<p>I don't know what Richard has told you, but a grudge is ridiculous. What do I have to have a grudge about? The man brought himself down and I am no worse for wear - I don't want anything he has. Of course he is a traitor, but it isn't like he basically ensured everybody knows this himself. Everybody knows what he did except you apparantly. </p>
<p>You know whenever I criticise him on this forum he anonymously defames me on the internet - he has done it many times, over the past few years, this is what they typically look like.</p>
<p>"Benjamin Noyles real name Benjamin Raymond is a Jewish infiltrator sent to promote disunity between nationalists."</p>
<p>"political student and former deputy leader of the Integralist Party whose pen name is Benjamin Noyles formally of the Integralist party has been ousted because it was discovered that his actual political beliefs are of a communist nature this all come to light within the past week and the party would like to distance themselves from such unsavory characters."</p>
<p>I don't care if you know or not, but from this point on lets be clear who has the grudge. </p>
<p>I don't know what your personal motivation is but it isn't fooling anyone. Lets not pretend this is somehow about 'fascism' or the 'cause'. What do you think the point of a 'free and open nationalist discussion' is about if not to say 'I will tollerate everything as long as I am king of the castle'. you helped with jack shit - wasted effort and wasted time.</p>
