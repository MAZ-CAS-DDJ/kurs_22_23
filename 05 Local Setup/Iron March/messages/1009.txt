<strong>Harold E. Goad M.A. </strong><p>A comprehensive explanation of Mussolini's Italy by an early admirer of fascism. The author first deals with what fascism is not, and then proceeds to examine every aspect of the Italian movement. Examples of this are the sections entitled The Labour Charter, The Universal Duty of Work, Wages, The Christian Principle and even a section regarding the Co-operation of the Press. Finally the moral issue is discussed. Whether it is right for an individual to strive only for his own enjoyment - or instead to pay due regard to what is best for his folk and his nation.</p>
