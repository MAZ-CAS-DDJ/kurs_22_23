<p>I've looked over cryptocat- its features are  impressive. </p>
<p>And links to the NRM is commendable. My gf and I have a project planned, similar in vein to Sigurd, which will draw upon our knowledge as foragers and campers and feel NA would benefit from what we could teach. Camping trips are on the meu, so it'd be great to invite the guys along once we all become better acquainted.</p>
<p>As for explicit help for the NRM, I simply wished to be able to be of use somehow. But when the aforementioned project is up and running, information will be able to be distributed. We have a US based guy who might wish to set up a chapter there (our naturalist project), based on the skills and methods were putting together though it is a long term plan of action we have here.</p>
<p>As for meeting, my partner and I are moving out of Leeds in the foreseeable future, to the rural outskirts where our work will be more efficient. What would be expected of us from NA? As I said, I have skills in computer security to a degree, and my partner has an impressive ability to command respect. I feel she has great potential in our movement.</p>
