<p>Actually, i agree with everything you said about economics, but i'd like it if you could explain a bit more about how you would have it set up. </p>

<p>I don't know if you've seen the Strasserism thread in the economics section of the forum, but i had a few questions about his views on the monetary system that no one ever answered. </p>

<p>I just don't understand what would be used as apposed to gold? He uses examples in his book "Germany Tomorrow" of 3 different currencies, two of which actually were backed by gold, and the last one backed by seized property from the bank. I know the Reich used labor vouchers (which i'm supportive of the idea of using), but i just can't seem to understand what Strasser's ideas on this were (i hope you can see how it would be confusing, especially when his examples contradict his ideas). </p>
