<p>Welcome. Personally, my idea consists of this, so forgive me if i am sounding messy or my message looks messy. In the Filipino context, that means we Filipinos will preserve national values (respect to elders, love of country and so on) and take good parts of Filipino character (discard bad ideas like total hospitality, love for USA, too many) while taking the good things from socialism (how socialists do it), and discard bad things (namely internationalism, disregard for labor, class wars, liberal democracy). While at the same time, we take some ideas from socialism, though not western socialism (especially not the liberal style socialism), but DPRK style Socialism (Philippines and DPRK are small countries, and the DPRK did well before 1995) or at least our own Socialism, even if deaths arise from mistakes done (the USSR rose in a few years with their industrial revolution with equal casualties compared to the west, A. Slavros said it in some webpage in DA). If it goes bad, then we Filipinos could take corporatism/syndicalism.</p>
<p>Remember that J. A. Primo De Rivera said</p>
<p>"Fascism was born to inspire a faith not of the Right (which at bottom aspires to conserve everything, even injustice) or of the Left (which at bottom aspires to destroy everything, even goodness)"</p>
<p>In the case of the DPRK, it kept the good parts of Korean character, like love for country and love for parents, not to mention you dont see skimpy women in Pyongyang and very little liberal degeneration or none at all. They (Kims and WPK) kept Korean values (love for parents, country and so on), but removed the bad characteristics from the previous colonial era/South Korea and Joseon Dynasty, like injustice, ignoring the people's pleas to save their Korea, writing in Hanja (many Koreans then and now use less Chinese letters, only the aristocracy can write Hanja as if it's nothing.) or worse, sucking up to Japan/USA, and took the best of socialism or made up their own concepts for their Juche (Autarky). </p>
<p>In short, we keep the good values of the right (love for country, elders, working hard) and and left (coopreation, mass mobilization, everyone working and so on). A true conservative will accept the social conservatism prevailing in a socialist country, a fake one will despise a socialist state with right wing characters (like the DPRK), mainly because its socialist. </p>
<p>BTW, i would love to go to a mass protest, even if i get injuries, but the socialists here want democracy and liberal faggotry (communist rebels here allowed gay marriage, but long before that i despised them), so i will not join. Seems that i am alone.</p>
<p>Also, any thoughts about Juche Study groups?</p>
<p>If you have problems with my reply, keep asking.</p>
