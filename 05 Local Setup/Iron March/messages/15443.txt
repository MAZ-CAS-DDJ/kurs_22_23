	Nah, I don't really love uni one way or the other. I guess I will just focus on grades and studying. Also, tried playing the old republic today and spent <em>to much </em>time on it. So I am going to permanently delete it this time. I just can't trust myself with video games. I guess I will just study and workout when I am not studying. Sorry for being so wishy washy about this whole thing. Fuck! Something must be seriously wrong with me. Anyways, the game is now gone forever and I promise I will leave you alone for a while. Let me know if you get this.
