<p>No one is quite sure what happened.</p>
<p>All that I know is that at least 100 of the commie bastards are dead.</p>
<p>The rally, which was ironically called "peace rally", was put together from leftards of all races and from many different parts of the country, but was in fact, nothing more than a rally held on the behalf of the HDP, the major, true-leftist party in Turkey.</p>
