<p>Just a note of sympathies. After reading your debate (the term here being more properly 'lalalaicanthereyoucommie fest') with FacistCapitalist, I couldn't help myself. Also the Southern dialect is probably an affectation. During my time as a Southern Nationalist inserting dialect was often a way just to irritate people. While dialect does come through in speech it rarely transfers to paper. Of course I'm not an educated self-made businessman, so what do I know?</p>
