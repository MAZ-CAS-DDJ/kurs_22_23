<p>There's an awful lot of misguided, pro-zionist opinion on this board, actually; it reflects the 'authoritarianism' of some of our more "modern"-influenced men. </p>
<p>You'll find there's a lot of people here pro-Israel merely due to their anti-Muslim stance; in any case - some grades of fascism on this board are certainly very "westernized" in the worst &amp; most modern sense. We even have another boy here who prances around acting like some sort of "<strong>liberal</strong> Fascist.", calling himself a "<strong>progressive</strong> Fascist."</p>
<p>Personally - as a German, and a national socialist at that, I hate the jews, completely. All forms of jewry..all types of jew..I don't care, I hate them. They drove my country into the ground &amp; have cheated, stolen and manipulated us for centuries; this cannot be forgiven. </p>
<p>I understand your unwillingness to forgive, because I cannot do the same.</p>
