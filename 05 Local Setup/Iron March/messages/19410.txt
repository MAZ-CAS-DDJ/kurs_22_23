	It all comes down to complete misinterpretation of the Bible. When you're in a society of leftist/pacifists then it will be interpreted in that way just because that's how the vast majority of people are thinking. Really what that verse is saying is to not get into pointless fights and arguments, not that you should just let anyone roll over you. Can we say that the early Medieval European kings were not good Christians because they stopped the Islamic invasions? They are the reason Christianity even exists today. Idk if you read Nietzsche but he is basically saying the same thing - the Overman does not waste his time with pointless fights and arguments as he is above them.

	As for something to read, you are probably going to want "For My Legionaries". But we don't even need it, we can prove monotheism logically and thus we know it's in accordance with Truth and fascism.
