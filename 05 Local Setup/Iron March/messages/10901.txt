<p>Lots really. Another short novel, year of ACTION manuals, will finish translating Ernst Junger's interwar articles, those we are definitely going to get published, anthology book of David Lane's works. Ideally, in time, I would hope that we just have our own IM library of fascist literature even if it exists on its own in pdfs already but that's also ways off.</p>
