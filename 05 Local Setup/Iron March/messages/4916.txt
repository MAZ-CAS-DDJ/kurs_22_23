<p>I remember you saying a while ago that you were into the occult. I know Himmler was really big on that stuff but it's hard to get hold of material which isn't biased or hasn't been heavily edited. I find it extremely strange that there's been a sudden opposition to<span style="font-weight:bold;"> </span>esoterism and the occult from the mainstream lately; the UK wants to put a filter on it.</p>

<p>I know that kikes are into the occult as well, they stole kaballah from the Ancient Egyptians, just like they stole everything from every other religion and slapped their own name on it.</p>

<p>You got any nazi occult stuff and most importantly any good black metal recommendations? Never really listened to any, figure I'll give it a try.</p>
