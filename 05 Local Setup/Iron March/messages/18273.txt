	No I don't deadlift it doesn't work any of the muscles that are mainly used for strength , it's more of a legs workout, plus it can really injure your shoulders your spine and pull your stomach. I have a sliding hernia so that kind of lifting isn't good for that.

	I don't follow anyone else's workout plan you should only follow what your own body is comfortable with , do your own research , its not that hard just google different exercises and which muscles they work, try and get comfortable with a weight before you increase repetitions and then slowly increase the weight.

	I was at 60 lbs bench pressing a few years ago but I stopped but I've recently worked my way back to 50 lbs I do 100 bench presses. I lift about 13 lbs curls in each arm last night I did 70 repetitions each arm. Also when bench pressing you should alternate between close grip meaning your hands close together touching , for triceps and further apart for pectorals and the rest of the arm muscles. Bench pressing doesn't do good bicep workouts.

	I would recommend starting with pushups try for 20 or 30 everyday and increase when your muscles get comfortable.

	The most important thing to remember is keeping good form meaning back straight stomach sucked in when doing pushups and weight lifting this makes sure you work the correct muscles even though it will be slightly painful and sore.
