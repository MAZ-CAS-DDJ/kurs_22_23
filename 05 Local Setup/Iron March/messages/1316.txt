<p>Ah, you enjoy SF games too? Excellent! I love the Mass Effect and KotOR series, what about you?</p>
<p>Also, regarding True Blood, could you describe it to me(from your p.o.v.) in a few sentences? I heard some people say it's bad and others that it's good and also.. that it contains SS vampires/werewolves(what the hell is with this Nazi fetish in every entertainment medium?)</p>
<p>I hope I do not bother you with those messages(I find it quite annoying to check my inbox myself.) Do you have MSN maybe?</p>
