<p>Yeah I was thinking about that too. While there are young kids marching in place of their grandfather, they don't really understand anything about Gallipoli or war in general. In a few decades, its just going to be a march on the 25th of April, and not a remembrance of the landings and all the other wars we have fought and Australians have died in. Its fucked, but I think a war that is closer to home than Afghanistan or Iraq may actually be beneficial to the national spirit. </p>

<p>Yeah got our bluefin, hung around the dawn service then got on the water at 7, bagged out by 11, on land by about 3. Had a late lunch of sashimi, tuna spaghetti, and tuna steaks, just a few hours after the fish came out of the water. I'll upload photos once I make an account on a photo hosting thing. And yeah you're right, I don't think there are as many hunters and fishers as I expected there to be. </p>

<p>Cheers mate</p>
