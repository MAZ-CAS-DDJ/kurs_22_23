<p>Well, the only thing I can really recommend here, is can you withdraw from ROTC or does your scholarship depend on it? I mean to be honest as a Fascist I really don't see why you are in ROTC in the first place. I mean I sure as hell not going to fight and die for the plague known as democracy. But, that is just my personal opinion and your reasons are your own. Anyways, these burns and your skinned skin, are the skinned marks close to each other? If they are I would just lie and tell people you tripped on the side walk or something and that how you got skinned. Yeah, it might make you look stupid, but that is better then what might happen. If you were to tell on these guys and they get kicked out, they might get together and beat the hell out of you or worse. Think of it this way, if this bunch of dishonorable, disloyal, people are going to be future military officers, why would you want to serve in such a military? Again, this is just my opinion and your reasons are your own. But, if they out number you, you may just have to sit this fight out. Yeah, I know that sucks but you can't get into a fight with the odds so stacked against you. Also, in my experiences if a group has the numbers they can completely make up some lie, tell on you, and make it the story that you are the bad guy and the one at fault here, and no one will question their story. That is actually a tactic the bullies in high school used on me several times, and the teachers never questioned their story because they had the numbers on their side, "so they couldn't possibly be lying, and I must be at fault". Hell, that tactic was used to bl-aim me for things when I wasn't anywhere near where so and so happened. So, I guess my advice here would be to leave if you can. I hope this helps or at least gets you to consider some things. Â </p>
