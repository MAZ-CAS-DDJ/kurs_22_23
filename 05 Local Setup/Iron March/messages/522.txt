<p>Comrade, the quote attributed to Adolf Hitler in your signature is actually historically associated and was said by Gregor Strasser - and that quote that floats around isn't altogether accurate. </p>
<p>The origin of the quote comes from an article written by Gregor Strasser attached on the end of Otto Strasser's Germany Tomorrow. </p>
<p>The full and accurate quote is such:</p>
<p>"We have recognized that the capitalist economic system with Its exploitation of those who are economically weak, with its robbery of the workers' labour-power, with its unethical way of appraising human beings by the number of things and the amount of money they possess, instead of by their internal value and their achievements, must be replaced by a new and just economic system, in a word by German socialism."</p>
