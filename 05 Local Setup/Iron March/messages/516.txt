<p>Yes thanks, I’ve read through parts of your website. I’ll give it a more thorough read at some point, when I get the chance.</p>
<p>As for me: I’m a 25 year old engineering student from Cheshire. I’m currently running the <a href="https://englishnationalresistancenorthwest.wordpress.com/" rel="external nofollow">English National Resistance – North West Division</a>, which is just a simple ethnic nationalist group aimed at youngsters.</p>
<p>My full political philosophy is more properly right-wing – something in-between fascism and Evola.</p>
<p>I’m really interested in all the cultural and social aspects to advancing a true right-wing movement, and how to develop them.</p>
<p>What’s the age range of the British Integralist Party, out of interest? I see on your site you say the nucleus of your movement lies in the younger generations.</p>
<p>I’ll consider checking out Skype.</p>
<p>I’ll register at the British Integralist Party forum right after I’m done typing this.</p>
<p>And I’ll send you an email too.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Chris.</p>
