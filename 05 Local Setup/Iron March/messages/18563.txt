	You should uh go to a cosplay you could find your waifu. Dress up as a Japanese Imperial Soldier and claim its fro anime also talk shit about other Asians that aren't Japanese also hail the Emperor and kirr Chinese Doggus.

	on a serious note you see why Frank hates anime it makes Asians a laughing stock . Frank seriously is sad about what happened to Japan you can tell in some of his more serious songs he talks about the atom bomb and how Japan was restructured as an American puppet. I really think he sees the degeneracy of his people.
