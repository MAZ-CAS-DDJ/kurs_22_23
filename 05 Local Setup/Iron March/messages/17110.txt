	It is; for it is happened but it's over.

	Romanians really killed a lot of our people in the wars of the past. They are trying to assimilate the Szeklers even today. Same with Slovaks, same with Serbs. That's however still not an argument for their extermination. Don't misunderstand me, I would be happy if the motherfuckers in our government would have had balls back in the '90s and would have gone to war for Transcarpathia, Bácska and the Slovakian territories of the Second Vienna Award, but what's the point if every government in the region is ruled by Jews including ours? As long as we don't change that every form Irredentism is just for show. The Hungarians living in Bácska would have the exact same shitty life within Hungary minus the assimilation, but who cares about that if we are unable to deal with the demographic crisis even within our own country? They are assimilating anyway into Globalism via Americanization.

	I was always amused by this. How do you not see that the Church is infiltrated and the pope does the opposite of the Catholic teaching? The Orthodox Churches are still full of former Communist agents, does that mean that Orthodoxy is Communism? Of course not. Hungary was attacked by Orthodox states through history but even the most hardcore Chauvinists of ours wouldn't state that there is an Orthodox Crusade going on against us behind the curtains, for that's just laughable. Seeing today's West as Catholicism is like seeing the Soviet Union as Orthodoxy. The Catholic Church is of course infected with decadency, but as I mentioned that's the same with the Orthodox Church, and these facts has nothing to do with true Catholicism and Orthodoxy. That's simply their corruption, not their nature.

<p>
	"Luckily" that means that they will weaken Christianity further. Not if that it wouldn't be in a shitty state already.

	I didn't mean that they are underestimating you or something like that. They just don't want to fight against you.
