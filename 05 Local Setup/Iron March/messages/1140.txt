<p>Jews do have higher IQ's but they are inferior in almost every other way. The thing is Jews use their extraordinary intellect for evil. They support communist movements. Read up on what the NSDAP said on the subject and tell me what you think. </p>

<p>If a society is forcibly multiracial there should be meritocracy. Race realism can even be state sponsored by if there is a black man who is the best qualified he should get the job.</p>

And for all I care, you can hate whoever you want, and say how much you hate them all you want. But it's not at all fair that someone should have to suffer because you hate them, and it’s a total abuse of power to legislate according to your personal sentiments, even if you use science to justify them.</div></blockquote>
<p>I merely want to be separate from them. They can do what they wish if they are separate. My prediction is they will die in their millions when left to their own affairs. Whites will not commit genocide against them, they will do it themselves. Eventually black on black violence will make the black population of sub-Saharan Africa similar to what it was before colonialism. This is my prediction, I would like to see them prove me wrong. But I am a realist. </p>

<p>Truly free speech was the free speech of the old USA. To my knowledge it has never existed anywhere else. </p>

<p>I do acknowledge their was a genocide of Jews in WW2. Hundreds of thousands of Jews were killed by the NS regime. The numbers however do not add up. There is no way 6 million could have died as there were not even 6 million Jews in Europe. I don't buy the stories of gaschambers and human lampshades/soap. </p>

If you’re saying that free speech leads to people “crusading” against those who disagree with them, free speech doesn’t imply that anything said by people influences government policy. It’s just the only way a government can truly get feedback on how its policies are working. If the government is full of shit, people will be able to call them out on it. Without appropriate feedback, a government never thinks anything it’s doing is wrong.</div></blockquote>
<p>Ok. I assume you support a libertarian republic. Legal free speech can exist. </p>

Communist revolutions have always taken place in third world countries, never in developed countries where the status quo was just fine.</div></blockquote>
<p>I live in a third world country. But the area I live in is sure not third world. The mostly white areas are generally much better off. Yes, I can't see first world countries having a communist dictatorship but there is cultural Marxism. Economic Marxism is no longer a problem but their is Cultural Marxism. Cultural Marxism attacks a nations culture. Unlike Mao and Stalin the communists in my government are not even remotely economically communist. </p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="436" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Do you expect corrupt leaders to order to have themselves executed? Whether you realize it or not, being in any group of people biases your thought. If a government plays too much of a master role, then it never thinks it’s wrong as long as it sticks to the same ideals, even if the people are suffering as a result of its policies. Preserving their own power and continuing their own goals is more important to them than doing what the people want.<p>And now you’ll probably say “Well, we’ll just overthrow a corrupt government,” and I’m telling you that’s easier said than done. Even a horribly corrupt government will still have a good chunk of military and intelligence agencies on its payroll, and they’ll do absolutely anything it takes to preserve their sovereignty.</p>
<p>Then you have to consider that people won’t overthrow a corrupt politician until they’re being hit pretty hard by the effects of corruption. You can’t expect to orchestrate a revolution every time a politician sneezes. Societal revolution isn’t an overnight process, you know. By the time the corrupt politician is overthrown, their damage has already been done.</p>
<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The state will be set up in a certain way. The leaders will be indoctrinated with the right ideology. An authoritarian government will indoctrinate its people and orchestrate a "revolution from above." This way the people will make it so the government can never become corrupt. In the future the state can orchestrate into a direct democracy but will still function like a totalitarian state. </p>

<p>Indoctrination is the key. I fully support a corporate monopoly. I am favor of a church monopoly. The official church will be run by the state. Read up on the "Protastant Reich Church." I am an anti-christian so the church will wither away as christianity is replaced by a new religion. This is what the NSDAP was doing.</p>

<p>It is debatable if his sister changed his work. His sister probably edited his work. It is possible that his ideas changed. Classical Fascism was influenced by Nietzsche and it was originally not antisemetic. Fascism/NS reject individualism because most people are lemmings. This is where the ideologue of Fascism and Nietzsche differ. Fascism will be used to make man into a new man. This man would be indoctrinated with new ideas and through eugenics will evolve into a new master race far superior to modern man. </p>
<p>There is tons of communist propaganda on wikipedia but this is section on Nietzsche is not. </p>

<p>Apartheid was by no means perfect. Whites still employed blacks. Many people are legitimately non-racist. Thats all fine and good but they are ignoring the facts. They ignore differences between the races in intelligence. They ignore the fact that different races commit more crime. Thousands of white lives would be saves and so would billions of dollars(I will use that currency as an example. Here we use the rand 1 dollar=about 10 rand. In a new white state will will use a different currency). White South Africans are being help back by black crime and affirmative action. </p>

As part of the “ignorant masses” myself, why should I trust any politician who doesn't trust me with the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?

That's probably why I have never encountered a pro-totalitarian who wants to live as a working-class citizen under a totalitarian government.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The government are the parents and the people are the children. Thats my opinion on the state. Like children are not responsible enough to take care of themselves the masses are not responsible enough to take care of themselves. Freedom of speech will prohibit the right policies because people do not have the right ideas. I am by no means working class. My family is petite-bourgeois. In this state I can see myself as a politician or being involved int the military. </p>

My nation is my extended family. </p>
<p>I am not a humanist. I am not concerned with helping starving children almost all starving children do not belong to my nation. I am not motivated to save lives. I am motivated to make my nation strong.</p>

<p>The government will differ from my exact ideology but it will stay within the lines of fascism. I am busy writing a manifesto which I can use to influence people. I think of myself as a fascist-socialist philosopher. </p>

When we don’t know the course of someone else’s life, we fill in the gaps with the general course of our own. If you’re eighteen years old and being executed for sleeping with a seventeen year old, you’re a victim of unjust, arbitrary, and harshly enforced laws. When somebody else does it, they should have waited a year. And if you say anything about lowering the age of consent, that’s no better. Then you’ll be executing 13 year olds for sleeping with 12 year olds, etc.</div></blockquote>
<p>18 year olds sleeping with 17 year olds is not pedophilia. Pedophilia usually implies rape. It can "technically" be consenting. I am more of a believer in the age someone looks then the age of consent laws. If I liked a girl that was 14 yet looked 20 I don't see why I can't like her. </p>

<p>If a nation is forced to be multiracial then there should be a meritocracy. Napoleon gave the Jews more rights though he did not particularly like them. I would have blacks and Jews excluded from my nation. Different races and national groups belong in their own nations. A person of a different race can be integrated into a culture. If someone is part Jewish then I can be considered an Aryan. I have never been mean to a black or Jewish person due to their racial/ethnoreligious group.</p>
