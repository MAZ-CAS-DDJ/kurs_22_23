	Yeah, the only reason these people dropped the case was because they realized that their allegations were only based on a communist girl's feelings. This girl's reputation just went down the shitter, and people are losing respect for her fast because of how radical she is. Naturally, she's blaming me and the "patriarchy", which is funny because she has a no-contact order.<br /><br />
	Anyways, they realized that if they had to tell my dad what these "allegations" actually were, he would be suing them. Because there was no investigation, no probable cause, just one girl complaining about two posters and lying about me being a "Domestic Terrorist". But the entire department is two-faced, they have people telling me I'm "not in trouble", counselors trying to shill me, and secretaries who were telling me the department determined I did nothing wrong, THEN charging me. <br /><br />
	The entire two-faced department came right down when my dad took off work, walked in with me, and we just asked the straight questions without getting angry. made a secretary panic and actually admit that she could lose her job over this. My dad made the point of saying he strongly disagrees with my views but that this whole thing is WRONG.<br /><br /><br />
	in the meantime, while I'm free I'm doing everything I can to get back on track. <br /><br />
	Except now my little brother got threatened. Somebody said "it would be a shame if the Neo-Nazi's brother met an unfortunate end, but it'd be a bigger shame if he grew up to be like his brother."<br /><br />
	THIS does not fucking fly.
