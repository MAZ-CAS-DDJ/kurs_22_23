<p>I'm aware of FE JONS but dissapointed in there performance. With the Spanish economy being the rathole that it is they should be having a lot more electoral success than they are. They could learn quite a lot from Gold Dawn.</p>
<p>I know what you mean about being alive at that time. The Spanish Civil War was absolutely glorious. A lot of the Falange also fought for the Axis during WWII, and when Franco banned them from going they sneaked out and fought anyways.</p>
