	Alex,
</p>

<p>
	<br />
	The people doing the background search are in the US DoD. They are going to make sure I'm not a spy/have foreign allegiances. They are going to spy on me for a couple weeks, talk to my neighbors, look at my Facebook, look at all URL's I've visited, etc...
</p>

<p>
	Is there anyway I can at least delete the threads I've started (only like 2)?
</p>
