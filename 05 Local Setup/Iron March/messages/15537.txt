	Its a pretty strange story. I was born in Sweden, and lived between the US, Poland, and Sweden for half of my life. My Dad is Irish-American. My mom is the Polish one. I was baptized Polish, raised with the language and tradition, and taught the history by my Babcia and Dziadzio. I currently live in New Jersey. There are a few Polish people over here - an interesting bunch. Poles in America are pretty patriotic and take pride in their heritage.

	This website does have all the necessary information, but a lot of people here miss it. You have to look deep into the forum to find the serious threads. A lot of people come here to post memes and argue. It just seems misguided to me.
