<p>&gt;criticizes my English</p>
<p>&gt;gets English criticized in return</p>
<p>&gt;calls it "strawman fallacy"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I believe it is actually <em>tu quoque</em>, you fucking spürdo bürdo XD</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You want to speak of strawmen? How about attacking my criticism of your English, rather than my responsum to your protest of my thread subjects, to wit:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Next time be a little impartial when trying to be a nanny and telling people what they should or shouldn't do in their leisurely lives, whilst also being a hypocrite and not even attempting to protest the drunk thread on General Discussions.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I think you're having (yet again XDDD) a problem comprehending English. If you can calm down, understand that you are a massive hypocrite and faggot, and go live under a bridge everyone else will be happy.</p>
