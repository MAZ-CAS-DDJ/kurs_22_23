<p>i am part greek, though mostly Scottish and German. i have just always had a close relationship with the Greek part of my heritage, and i feel closely connected to the gods of ancient Greece.</p>
<p>back to oregon, the town i live in, tri-city (its in douglas county, one of the larger counties in the state) in is more than 90% white, though recently theres been a small increase in the hispanic population, nothing much, just a family or 2</p>
<p>Hi, Goliath;</p>
<p>Sorry it took so long to respond, but I've been very busy at work and, then, for the holidays.  I hope you had a nice Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>I can understand feeling closer to one part of your heritage.  I respect all parts of my ancestry, but feel closer to my German roots.  </p>
<p>Is Oregon liberal to the point where it dominates state politics, or is it mostly confined to certain areas?  Californian non-liberals are so outnumbered that we're effectively powerless against our Marxist government.</p>
</div></blockquote></div></blockquote> <p>srry for taking a while  to reply, my computer was in the shop. oregon is ran by the democratic northern half, though the southern half isnt necessarily powerless. the good news  is that we are moving to a more conservative goverment. either way, oregon issome what more conservative, and much more white-friendly than california. this may be a little late, but happy yule! ps im writing this on a tablet,'sorry for any spelling errors.</p>
