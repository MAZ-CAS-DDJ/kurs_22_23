	Swimming helps a lot with health at least, I do it a lot too. Not competitively, though I did until late high school when I had too much on my plate. But casually, for fun.<br /><br />
	And even a swimmer's body is better than a couch potato one. :P

	It's more the culture around it. I don't care how "toned" a guy's body is, I care about the impression of strength and masculinity in and of themselves. Proportionality sure, anyone who has a huge upper body and no lower body is: 1) grossly unaesthetic, and 2) probably gay.
