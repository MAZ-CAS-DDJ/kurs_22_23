	Still not getting my point yes they take the people you don't like with them but also people who could share the same views as you, or even you yourself if you happen to be standing in their completely random unpredictable line of fire at a store or at a school.

	Trump is honestly not understanding what he's even doing , right now he's trying to get foreign diplomats to stay at his hotels to make more money and getting foreign countries to put business partners in political positions, I believe Duterte put a building partner for Trump Tower Manila as secretary or ambassador to something.

	He went back on all of his racism as soon as he got elected, like I called it from the beginning it was all rhetoric to win the vote of the poor and stupid Americans.

	What about your Dad ? Isn't he some sort of tough Duterte Family Man figure ?
</p>

<p>
	Why don't they want to return to the Philippines since Duterte is making it great again ?

	Also you better grab your sisters and take them somewhere before they go full cuckold , either with :
</p>

<p>
	option A , a nerdy white man with yellow fever.
</p>

<p>
	option B , a large black man lookin for booty.
</p>

<p>
	option C, Jose the gardener and local Vato hangin with the locos , wants himself some Chinita.
</p>

<p>
	You said you weren't worried about your sisters because they were Catholic , well most ese's are Catholic and they like Filipinas from what I've heard when I used to hang with the mexi's.

	Hey man , I'm an only child I don't have sisters to worry about , because if I did I guarantee you I'd be 100% more radical and protective of them, but all I have is myself and my ageing parents. My parents are looking to move somewhere nice to retire at , me I'm fucked no matter where I go.

	I've also recently been thinking whats the point in fighting for our race to survive ,it's all going to end anyways , most scientists estimate the human race doesn't have much time left and if I had children they'd be living in such a miserable existence it wouldn't be worth it to put a human being through this world. People keep saying its for a higher power the natural order or some wacked out stuff , but seriously if God was really there listening do you think he would allow this abomination to keep on going. I keep trying to fool myself and say I want to make Aryan babies for some abstract ideals , to preserve all this cultural spiritual mumbo jumbo. It just feels like its not the answer, it just feels like all of this is the meaningless cry for help from people that see the world for what it is and the fact is there is no one coming to save us and nothing we can do.
