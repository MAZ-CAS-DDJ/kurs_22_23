<p>Interesting thoughts, especially the analogy to the 1880s. I had always put us in the early 1900s, pre-WWI perhaps? Given what I have seen and the general failure of actual groups (CasaPound, despite their fringe popularity have not really done anything) hearing that really seemed like a bit of an eye opener. Perhaps we should focus on a synthesized, coherent worldview.</p>
