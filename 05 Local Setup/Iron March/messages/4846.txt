<p>haha, that blew my mind a little, though I was a little suprised you went from all those statistics and benny klassen to CI - i have seen it happen a lot. Torren, jacob as examples. I am in that RPN drama Matt Heimbach claims he is now he is orthadox after he read a book, even though innitiation into the church takes a year.</p>

<p>Still why? your plan is kind of vague, do you hate athiests that much. Is it just a hassle having to differenciate yourself. </p>

<p>I was drunk and with this communist Jew and this emasculated german discussing mein kampf some time (so I wasn't much good) - not sure what started it, subject of censorshop maybe "oh my god mein kampf is so boring and so poorly written too" I tried to make the point that the book is well written in that it is supposed to connect to its target audience and their mentality, kind of related my own experience. I take them up on the 'boring' think - how is is boring by comparison, it is biogaphy, ideology in spoken language - das kapital is unreadable - just unreadble numbers. (and unlistenable. there is one audio book out there on librivox appropriately read by a camp northerner - it is appaling)</p>
<p>they are like "OH MY GOD HOW DARE YOU EVEN COMPARE THE TWO, Das kapital is art, it is so beautiful"</p>
<p>mfw. I guess you already know what hitler had to say to it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don't know where these leftists got off calling Mein Kampf boring, it is exciting stuff - have these people read Richard Dawkins God Delusion? Canto general? Dworkin's Our Blood? that is all boring shit (and in my education i had to read it, never once mein kampf though) - to say nothing for leftist fiction and for their 'classics'; locke, paine, rosseau, etc. there is a reason that leftists always go on about how intelligent they are, because these books are made to gratify their sense of being enlightened. It is all fake, that isn't good writing. Guarantee only 3% of these faggots that claim, actually read any of this stuff.</p>

<p>When I was about aged 16, MK just blew my mind - but 99% of it flew over my head at the time. that is great writing if the 'dumbest corporal' can get it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>every time read or listen I pick up someting completely new.</p>
