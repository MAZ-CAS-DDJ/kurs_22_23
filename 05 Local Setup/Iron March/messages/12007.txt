<p>I dont play much fantasy games actually, I play more medieval games because they have the best mechanics, and I use fantasy mods for those games like Third Age Total War, Game of Thrones mod for Crusader Kings 2, various mods for Mount &amp; Blade and stuff. Various Warhammer mods, stuff like that. Witcher and Elder Scrolls come to mind as pure fantasy games that I like. Got any good strategies and rpgs to recommend, I need ideas on something new to play, and cant think of anything these days</p>
