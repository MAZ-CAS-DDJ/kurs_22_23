	Believe it or not I'm already a member of that discord group (under a the name Batlord). I joined via the TRS forums, so I didn't think it was the same one.

	After the doxxing incident, I got worried since some of my older accounts were linked to my real name, and deleted most my old stuff, along with my entire internet history, including passwords. Since I hadn't written down my old Discord password, I figured myself locked out of that account. I know I'm a nobody, but I wasn't going to take any chances, given I know that Antifa have a fairly strong presence at my college.

	Would it be possible to get the "Batlord" account removed from the group, since it's my old one?
