	Finally I've finished the game, the book I still reading it because I also have books that I have to read of the University you know... The videogame was so good, 2 years ago I passed the videogame Thief for PS3 and Thief Gold is much better (regardless the graphics of course). The story is much better, I had some problems to download it but finally I got it.
