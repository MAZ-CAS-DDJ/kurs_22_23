<p>I don't think Jews were ever forced to be bankers, I think it was hard-wired in their programming that controlling the wealth of European rulers would be worthwhile.</p>
<p>The part about being observant socially could be Autistic, I don't know about your case but in my case I do often notice when people are uncomfortable or whatever, when it happens it seems like  am tapping into something unknown but that maybe just what normal people can tell everyday and my noticing it is rare.</p>
<p>All of those things probably are a form of autism, as I have said I don't trust the psychological diagnoses of modern doctors, all of these disorders just sound like a way of being able to attach labels to character traits. I can't imagine any neurological disorders beyond autism and the really bad ones (I really hate schizophrenics, I've known some and they need locking up) You are most likely either normal or autistic in some way.</p>
<p>Perhaps my sharing traits with many of the people I consider to be enemies will be useful, like Harry Potter when he took down Voldemort. Other Autistics seem to be blind to their own shortcomings, whereas as I as I have mentioned elsewhere improve constantly.</p>
