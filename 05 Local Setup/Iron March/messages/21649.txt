	That's pretty cool about the band, most of us down here are into metal, though I only one of us has actually played in a dedicated metal band. The nominal distinction between Fascism and NS is pretty unimportant. What's important is whether or not you're interested in activism and getting involved. If you are, I'd like to meetup sometime. If the answer is no, just say so.
