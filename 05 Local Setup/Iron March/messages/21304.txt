	Well, I certainly have enough reading to do keeping me away from boredom. I really like the set up of this board and forum. I am hoping to contribute much to it with my knowledge of philosophy and economics. I feel that is what I can contribute to this place. Currently I am watching some old school Dark Shadows television episodes. It's like nostalgia for me, haven't watched this old series in forever.
