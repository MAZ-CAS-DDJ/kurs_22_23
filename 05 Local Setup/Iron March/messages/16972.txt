	Varg is great. I would love him if he had just done all that shit in the 90s and gone out BrievikÂ style like he was planning to, but the fact that he is now this wise older guy who talks about his ideology on YouTube is great. I am a very rural person so he speaks to me in a lot of ways when he talks about nature and tradition.
