<p>Yes of course, but we will reclaim territories that we have held as "ours". We will reclaim territories where our people actually exist(Karabagh, East Turkestan, amongst many). Our forefathers had the idea of "nizam-ı Alem", bringing justice to the realms, however we have seen that neither our justice nor our presence is welcome, not even amongst our co-religionists.</p>
<p>150 years from now on, Arabia will be nothing more than a piece of worthless desert. I'd rather have an ethincally homogenous country.</p>
