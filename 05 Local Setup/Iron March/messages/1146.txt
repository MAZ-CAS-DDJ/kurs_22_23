<p>Sorry I missed this. Had a massive ingection in my jaw that left me out of the loop. Also this will mainly be an exchange of text, so no worries on that. I'll be in ytouch with you on a time to reschedule, but I'm planning a pretty massive project that I'd like help on. Think a three part film, a Fascist Zeitgeist. The first one will focus on attacking Liberalism and Cultural Terrorism and have a slightly Nihilist slant, the second is an attack on Democracy and Western Decadence from a Futurist angle, the final film will likely not explicitly use the term 'Fascism' but we'll more or less push the ideology, and Actual Idealism.</p>
