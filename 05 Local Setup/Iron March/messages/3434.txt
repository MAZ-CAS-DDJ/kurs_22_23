<p>No prob, that it is. I'm probably on the more left-leaning third-position like yourself, I've been gradually moving right recently, so I joined this site and looked for things relating to Juche, which I consider similar to my own position. I don't like it's use in North Korea, though, perhaps the government is too corrupt? Not enough Confucian ethics embraced? Well, all I know is that it isn't working well.</p>
<p>Eh, I don't like using forums very much, I prefer facebook (simpler and more straightforward) but I'll stick here. Explain yours more, are you often around leftists outside of this forum?</p>

<p>Well if you consider NSP, Traum Von Eisen (he posted quotes from Hugo Chavez and most of IM got butthurt), Darkwood, and Koka as leaning to the left, yes. But i do have good relationships with those on the right, like Svitanok, and Aristocrat. But you are at least sane enough to consider original Juche as a third positionist idea, not as totally "leftist". Also, beware of Faggotcapitalist (his name is fascistcapitalist, he is not a fascist in any shape or form, just a neo-con trying to look like a Fascist). He is a total retard. Don't ever listen to him, don't ever falter to him or his allies. Don't let them troll you. He is not worthy of debate.</p>
<p>I blame the flaws in DPRK due to Liberal states trying to make the DPRK extinct. I mean, the DPRK was already prosperous, remember the Chollima Movement? </p>
<p>If the DPRK is so corrupt, the KPA or the government would've been purged and the USSR/PRC knowing it. The DPRK itself already has Confucian ethics. I mean, Kim Il Song told of helping his parents, and keeping the parents' tradition of being Nationalists alive, by fighting the Japanese as a guerilla army, and evolving into a National Socialist state. A part of Confucian ethics is loyalty to parents. Once more, if DPRK is being hellish, the government would've been destroyed by KPA. </p>
<p>BTW, i already made a thread about DPRK. Most were like "DPRK bad!", no shit.</p>
<p>Also, i am influenced by the great Imam Khomeini, who put back Iran to rebirth with Shia revival. Why do you think the DPRK and IRI are allies? Because both were/are against the modern world trying to put its influence on them and the immorality of the modern world, like gay pride parades. Both have different paths to rebirth (Juche and Shia Revival/Khomeini), but both share the same "we don't like the liberal west and communist east!". </p>
<p>Juche has its rightist influence by preserving their culture, why do you think Kim Il Song wasn't for the cultural revolution? Because he knew that culture is a part of their country, and it must be preserved, although he did the right thing in which he cut off the chinese influence of his nation. It has its racial parts as well, have you read "the cleanest race"? Even the KCNA did admit at once the horrors of multiculturalism. </p>
<p>Juche has collective and individualist qualities. Man is the master of everything, says Kim Il Song, and that i think, also refers to the individual. To put that, he also considered the community. He is the master of the community, he is master over his own destiny. </p>
<p>BTW, what is your opinion on Pak Jeong Hui? Even as a KimIlSungist myself, i still respect him. Also, what is your opinions on race (like blacks and so on), as a Jucheist?</p>
