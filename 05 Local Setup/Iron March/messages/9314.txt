<p>That is a powerful poem, the first stanza is a perfect description of the modern world.</p>
<p>Poetry awakened me to truth, thus it awakened me to fascism.</p>
<p>Here are my latest two poems, I hope they are ok: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxtsy90v4GyWORtZBy1tpkcOV3kIAJ3DA4CCBQFruAc/edit?usp=sharing" rel="external nofollow">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxtsy90v4GyWORtZBy1tpkcOV3kIAJ3DA4CCBQFruAc/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p>I'm glad to have provided some useful materials, feel free to recommend anything because I am always expanding. I want to have the world's largest secret collection of redpill material.</p>

<p>The only thing I don't like about Codreanu is how I can't imagine a man as great as him in the current day. Sad indeed. He died a hero for all time. I can't imagine how a woman couldn't love him, Sylvia Plath was quite right.</p>

<p>Thankfully she is no longer. My mother is a very casual dater and I almost never meet her boyfriends. The reason I knew about the kike is because she told me I had to ditch fascism if they were to get serious. I said he could stick it up his ass.</p>

<p>Mothers have too many worries to understand our passion. Mine has a particular knack at knocking the wind out of my fascist sails with her endless sentimentalism. Like tonight, I had to listen to that liberal prattle after one of the better days I've had in a long while. She thinks illegal Aztecs aren't any different than Italians, wtf? And she has this whole anti-anglo victimization narrative, claims we aren't actually white. Pretty weird.</p>

<p>My father thinks I'm stupid for caring about politics but is otherwise pretty cool with it. As long as I keep it to myself mostly.</p>

<p>Btw, what kind of music you into?</p>
