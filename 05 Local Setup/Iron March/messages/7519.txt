<p>I like how sinarquismo is so Mexico-centric. Latin American movements that are just carbon copies of European movements are horribly cringe-worthy. I guess with synarquismo it comes down to whether you're white first, Mexican second... or Mexican first, white second.</p>

<p>I'd compare them to CasaPound or HogarSocial, only way more religious. If I was Mexican I'd work with them till something better came along.</p>
