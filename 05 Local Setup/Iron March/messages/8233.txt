<p>G'day m8,</p>
<p>Been wanting to dip my toes into a bit of stencilling around my town and was curious as to wether you could do up some custom designs, you seem to have a good knack when it come's to graphic design, something that I've no experience or knowledge with, realise your probably a busy lad too and would fork out some coin for your work! I'd think you'd make a little pocket money if you did employ your skills to such services, just an inquiry mate all good if you can't.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
