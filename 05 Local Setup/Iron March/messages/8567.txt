<div> </div>
<div><strong>The Nordic Resistance Movement has sent a representative and a journalist to St. Petersburg where they will participate in the national and conservative conference which will take place today. </strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Nordfront can now inform that one of our journalists and a representative from the Resistance Movement are present in St. Petersburg to take part in the national and conservative conference which is held in the city. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yesterday our representatives arrived at their hotel and had time to meet with foreign comrades and to discuss plenty with soldier volunteers from Donbass. <strong>Peter Jusztin</strong>, who represents the Resistance Movement during the conference, reported yersterday that there are already many nationalists gathered and many familiar faces. He also said that Der Spiegel is present and is very intrusive. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Today's meeting goes by the name "The International Conservative Forum" and is arranged by Russian nationalists. The conference was intended to include speeches, seminars and roundtable conversations, but certain things appear to have been canceled due to a lack of time. Jusztin reports that the event keeps a high standard and that he and other foreign guests have received earphones and will have the speeches translated to them. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In front of the conference it was told that nationalists from 15 different nations would participate and today Jusztin says that he has met or noticed at least Germans, Englishmen, Americans, Italians, Frenchmen, Belgians, Finns, Greeks and Eastern Europeans today. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The media interest for the conference is very great and a small group of counter-demonstrators could be seen outside. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The stated purpose of the arrangers is to gather nationalists from various parts of Europe and create a platform which could be used to discuss the common threats which the European nations face. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The purpose of the Resistance Movement is to establish contacts with nationalists from Russia and other European countries aswell as to observe what is happening and take part of what is said during the conference. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><em><strong>A more detailed report will be published here on Nordfront after the conference. </strong></em></div>

<div> </div>
<div><strong>The Resistance Movement's persons at the national and conservative conference in St. Petersburg now reports that the conference has been threatened by bombing. </strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The threat is said to have been forwarded via telephone which informed that there is a bomb in the premise where the conference is to be held. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The threat was received with such a great seriousness that the participants are now evacuating the conference building. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Police has been present all day but the Police and what is suspected to be the security service are now more occupied than ever. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Beyond this there is only scarce information so far.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>UPDATE: </strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The conference was canceled after the bombing threat but the persons sent from the Resistance Movement took the opportunity to visit the headquarters of the Russian Imperial Movement and are now back at the hotel. </div>
