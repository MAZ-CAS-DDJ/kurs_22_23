<p>Hey so some other stuff has happened. I asked slavros to delete my account if he sees an irregular IP on my account because police. Here's a segment of the thing I sent to him explaining why, to fill you in on what's happened.</p>
<p>In the little hearing I went to, one of my other friends who is known to associate with me was brought up and so he was also searched. On his school laptop they found a video of us wearing masks and burning ADL stuff. The administration said we looked like ISIS, so they turned it into the police and said it was being reviewed by homeland security officials.</p>
<p> So he got kicked out too.</p>
<p> He just signed on to steam for the first time since his laptop was confiscated, and it says its been accessed by unkown computers in Colorado springs, Denver, and Pennsylvania, 12 times. Steam license agreement says that a government official can log into a steam account without user permission if necessary and he never was asked for permission, so there's that. So he's definitely being checked in on.</p>
<p> Another thing is I pulled out an old laptop I had hidden and remembered stories of people being watched through webcams. I opened my webcam to see if anything happened and it said another application was using it.. And it hadn't been turned on for at least three months. I opened up manycam to see if it would work and it said another user on the computer had the webcam open but I was the only user on the computer.</p>
