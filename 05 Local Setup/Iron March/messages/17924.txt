	Thomas is the major problem. We have a guy acting as a mole in that group. Thomas is just too far up his own ass. We have way too many good, motivated, and politically sound people that are just rotting under his leadership.

	I have no idea what is going on with Dillon other than he seems stressed out of his mind. I actually feel empathy for him which is one of the reasons why I stuck around AV for as long as I did. I had a feeling IM was going to blow me up but it was worth it in the end. At least my name is somewhat established here now without me having to stick around too long.

	Anyways I really appreciate the messages, I doubt I'll get gassed or anything like that. If you are inactive you are welcome to link up with us.

	Most of us joined AV either because we didn't really have any idea what we were doing and just wanted to do our bit or because we had faith things were changing. But Thomas is holding the entire thing back and we're done with it, so we're going to be doing our own thing.

	I don't need to explain all this to you, I'm sure you already understand.
