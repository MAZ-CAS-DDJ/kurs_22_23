			Yup, I heard about that version too. It doesn't really matter anyway, for Gülen is a real threat and he had many followers in Turkey. Not anymore. I don't really know what to think about Erdogan; if this was a coup d'état, then he is clever, but if it was all staged then it is possible that he is even better. (Btw note that though the happening haven't even ended the Western media was already full with news about how it was a fake, just like with the referendum of Crimea.) It makes me smirk when everybody cries about how he is destroying democracy in Turkey. I don't think that the West can do anything they want, especially this time when Turkey tries to get closer to Russia.
