<p>There are two templates of women in my eyes.</p>
<p>1. The strong woman, A woman who can chose to be independent and pursue a life which may lead to seek happiness and enlightenment through themselves, whilst holding onto their dignity and self-respect. Among the strong women are the working class woman, the earnest and loving mother, the pious(of whichever religion they belong to) and the intellectual thinker.</p>
<p>2. The weak woman, A woman who seeks nothing but personal and immediate fulfillment, she relies on the opinion of others and seeks only to indulge in pointless acts that are self damaging as well as damaging to her surroundings. This person cares nothing for virtue, duty or the well being of anything above the self. They constantly try to blame others for their failures in life or try to find an excuse to pretend as though it was of no personal fault of their own, the worst of these is the woman whom is self-defeating apologizer who chose to revel in self-loathing and remains there excusing it as their "imperfections" while not in any way attempting to better herself.</p>
<p>That is a weak woman, in my eyes.</p>
