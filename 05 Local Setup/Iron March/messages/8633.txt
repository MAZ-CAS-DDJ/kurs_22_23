<p>Army or Marines seem more interesting to me, I know that besides PMC there's not really any job skills that transfer from what i think seems fun and bad ass but eh, it's a growing market at least.</p>

<p>Although my Father wants me to Go AirForce because that's what he was in last and there's and airbase nearby but unless i could be a pilot which requires you to be an Officer and also be on contract for like 16 years (they don't want to waste they pilot training money) it's seems incredibly boring, also I don't have 20/20 vision so unless i got lazik then thats not happening. Also i've never flown so that could be an issue.  Maybe though.</p>

<p>Navy again seems boring to me. Although they seem like they get more leisure time on shore leave i.e. actually visit places people want to visit.</p>
