<p>G'day lads. Because we've got this new historic movements section for pre-2000, I thought one or both of you guys could do a write up of the ANM with the info from the book that JVT wrote. I can do something for Stephensen's Australia First. I told Slavros to move  the threads on Saleam's Australia First and the Australian National Socialist Party, and to add the thread on Eric Campbell's book to the existing thread on the New Guard. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Do you reckon there's any other movements worth writing about?  I can't think of any other important ones apart from these ones. There's the Old Guard but there isn't much info and they didn't do much, and the League of Rights which haven't done anything important as far as I can tell. Anything else I can think of is too small or too kosher. </p>

<p>Cheers, have a good one. </p>
