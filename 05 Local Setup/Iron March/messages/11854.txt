<p>Same here. Since I never told you what mine was for. My last one was because I had a gun in my car (and all of my belongings since I was homeless) and told a friend I was depressed. Even though it was legally stored and everything they arrested me. And this next case is for burglary and theft. Basically a buddy of mine got busted and blamed me. It's stupid. Carries up to a 12 and a half year sentence. </p>

<p>What exactly happened though, with the theft thing though? I hope you don't take some shitty deal and get in more trouble than you need to is the only reason I'm wondering. I've been in the same position before. :/</p>
