	Yes the alt-right are pretty much unanimously against gay marriage and adoption PERIOD. The only reason why it seems confusing as to why the alt-right wouldn't support it is because of the alt-light  (milo, paul joseph and cernovich jewish faggots that merely wanted to coopt the cultural movement) that have tried to make it about classical liberalism &amp; civic nationalism! The New Right, a older strand of alt-right that are more economically right-wing &amp; overly concerned with politics which I adhere to, was being called "racist" for taking on a ethno-nationalist stance, being against Islamic immigration and sexist for bashing feminists &amp; pointing out how women are better suited in supportive roles &amp; as mothers well before the alt-right become larger and gained attention in the MSM! Another reason why there may be confusion is because they focus 99% of their efforts on the differences between races and genders as well as the jews! The alt-right is against faggotry because of their desire to return to old fashioned family values and because they believe there is harm in homosexuals taking care of children, such as the prevalence of pedophilia and HIV among them. Basically what unites alt-right, New Right, and fascists is that moral absolutism &amp; of course the hatred of the left. Its just the alt-right and new right aren't as well
