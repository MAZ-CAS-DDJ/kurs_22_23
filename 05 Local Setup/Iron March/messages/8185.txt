<p>Glad you think that mate, Id say a magazine would be a pretty big stretch but something that would help spread our cause amongst working class youth, problem is that it would cost a fuckload to get quality like ZOO haha and it'd need models in there or no cunt would buy it, just exclusively white models <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> but anyway that's just a thought, I wouldn't know where to start with something that big...NA activism though is where it's at...small banners, Graf, megaphones haha hay street mall with some lads! Flyers and all that is where we should start.</p>
<p>Cool your chatting with Saleam, not to sound like a broken record, know I'm preaching to the choir but The problem I see with soft One nation type Nationalism, as what aus first is sort of replacing but with more backbone, Is how much of our struggle is spiritual and racial in nature? As opposed to wholly materialistic and economical because if we toe the line on soft &amp; big tent nationalism, will it not lead us back to old labor? Because that is in essence the soul of our Nationalism...well the root. I dig your respect and see the relevance of van Tongerin , as a young bloke I just don't get that rebel feel to current nationalism here (aus first), in which their focus seems to be a lot on our economy (understand the reasoning and tactic behind it)</p>
<p>Also as perhaps what Saleam insists on, is it leaves us as soul-less as we were in the later half of the 20th century, left to succumb to the devices of liberalism and subvert what nationalism we had, in which the racial aspects almost were wholly considered for economic reasons and not on a spiritual or un-materialistic plain. Obviously immigration is something that threatens our racial homogeneity but it should be publicly acclaimed of it being so instead of it's obvious economical factors, same with disdain for democracy, to proclaim that we as a nation, a racial whole, should be considered at the forefront of governing policies and not the brunt bearers of economical and party politics should be said loud and clearly. I guess the MSG of aus first just ain't fash enough!</p>
<p>You see in European Nationalism, with it's various culture wings, a clear focus on improving physical and spiritual health in their population, when economically, these nations are far worse off than we are in Australia. They don't have a large  Soviet type Nation looming above them, frothing to gather what it can reap, nor do we have the level of degeneracy but we do need a solid back bone to keep from falling away again as we have in the past. Not that I don't support what Saleam does or Australia First, just bullshit thinking though mate because I'm not doing anything personally better so is salute what thy do, just thoughts.</p>
<p>Il be in Perth soon mate il let you know, would be good to sit down and plan some actual shit, il see if my meagre comradery down in Albany is keen for an expedition to Perth as well,more the merrier...(I see not more than 5-6 blokes in some of NA's activism...maybe we could radicalise australia first, dunno...keep in touch mate! </p>
