<p>Heil! I am pleased to write you comrade.</p>
<p>I am a believer in the sciences and in evolutionary adaptation, but in this case social evolution.</p>
<p>Thus, I believe in the adaptation of systems (like National Socialism) to best fit the needs of social groups.</p>
<p>I believe in economics and finance being used to the benefit of the social group also.</p>
<p>I believe in National Socialism with a slight leaning toward certain ideas of Strasserists. However, where National Socialists and Strasserists blamed Jews for all the negative aspects of Capitalism, I do not. My mother is Jewish, and I do not believe in invented racialism. I will only accept something that can be scientifically proven beyond a doubt, and there is no science suggesting the mother's side of my family invented materialistic Capitalism, or that materialism is something unique to Jews (I also consider Judaism a culture/religion. But I believe in defining Judaism on nationalistic lines. German Jews are not Romanian Jews, and so on).</p>
<p>But of course, I acknowledge that Hitler was not antisemitic, just a political genius. He admitted many German Jews into the Third Reich.</p>
<p>But this means I also have a problem with the current neonazi movement, which is out of touch with Naziism.</p>
<p>Anyway, I oppose Capitalism wasting human potential just as I oppose Communism wasting human potential. I think Communism and Capitalism are wastes of the human evolutionary product, and they squander and waste resources, and make the human's life more miserable than is necessary. One by sanctioning a kind of servitude, and the other by destroying the human spirit in poverty and a denial of human nature.</p>
<p>And Democracy is just mob rule that turns into USSR Communism. You can vote, but everyone is the same. And it is illogical.</p>
<p>So I approve of National Socialistic political reform. However, I oppose institutionalized slavery, and the killing or brutalizing of unarmed combatants (that is unprofessional at least). Do not shoot someone who is in a submissive position, so to speak. I also believe in Charter Fascism.</p>
<p>As far as racialist theory goes... I have a problem with the hypocrisy that Africa is for Africans but Europe is for everyone. Other races do not actually bother me, and I view races as a spice of life, but there will not be races if they breed themselves out of existence. So I believe in some separation.</p>
<p>That does not mean we can not cooperate in science, math, and development still. It means I think human social group potential is maximized by interacting in a homogenous group, but also sharing ideas with other homogenous groups. Such as a white Germany cooperating sometimes with a brown Ethiopia. I hope that makes sense.</p>
<p>I can not think of anything else right now. I tried to be thorough enough. And it is already too long for me to be more specific.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tschüß</p>
