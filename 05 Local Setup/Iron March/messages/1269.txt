<p>Thanks a lot Nebuchadnezzar II'. You and the folks I have listed as my friends are the only voices of reason in this joint. We must be mericless in exposing the Red agents like NSP who are trying to pull the wool over our eyes and have people believe that there are no differences between Fascism and Marxism. I have no gripes about original Distributism, it seems OK to me even though I think we need Fascist Capitalism to develop our Nation so we can win out in the struggle for existence, but I don't have anything against the folks who have a warm place in there hearts for *original* Distributism. Its all this neo-Distributism that I hate which is being peddeled by straight out Liberation "theologists" who are peddeling ideas straight out of the old Marxoid/Syndicalist/Socialist playbook like stealing property to turn into *Worker Co-Operative" (worker control of the means of production, as the Communists accurately call it) and preaching hatred and envy of the successful members of society (class warfare as the Reds also call it). *That* I have a big problem with.</p>
<p>Anywhoo, thanks for adding me. I'm proud to call you a comrade in the struggle. Keep giving the Reds on here hell and posting good stuff.</p>
<p>Fascism Forward!</p>

<p>It appears I'm already causing controversy with some of the people who are trying to shine up the image of fascism away from prejudice with my views towards jews (primarily on spiritual grounds and not genetic... I have already said that Jews can transcend being Jewish). It is proof enough of that when you see how many Jews were soldiers for Hitler... granted they were mainly 1/16th Jew and 1/8th Jews and mixed in with the German biologically and spiritually.</p>
<p>Am I right in believing that you believe merely in using regulated capitalism (maybe heroic capitalism as Mussolini termed it) as a tool in fascism and it take precedance secondary to the social aspects of fascism? If so then I don't see what everyone's gripe is with you. I am a distributist second and a Traditionalist/fascist first and foremost.</p>
<p>In my opinion, unregulated international free market capitalism and communism are 2 sides of the same coin, same with this syndicalist crap... every business sector needs leadership.</p>
<p>I think we are all in agreement however that interest and usury needs to be squashed, that is the main problem economcially and socially and  it always has been since the days of Sumerian civilization. I see the same things happening today that happened in Sumeria and Babylon and caused their downfalls and later in the Mediterranean civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome. As evola said, the East isn't doing much better either so they can't be cocky towards the west.</p>
<p>The problem with people on this site, just like in the real world is they are presumptious intellectuals who do not think, they want their thinking done for them, they lack common sense. As I said you, vlad, ben and probably a few others are the only ones here who have their head screwed on and their heart in the right place.</p>
