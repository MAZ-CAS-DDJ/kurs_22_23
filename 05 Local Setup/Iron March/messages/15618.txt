	That sounds a lot like my red pilling story as well...even down to the fascism would be an idea government if it allowed personal liberty haha. Only difference was it was Red Ice and finally here, not /pol, that I finally excepted the inevitable and stopped deluding myself. Took awhile to get over the social programming that fascism=bad, to the point I was calling myself a "MinArchist-Nationalist" to avoid the label of Fascist.

	Yes a few more. What's your ancestry and religion? Like I said were a group of Poles so to be apart of that group you have to be Polish. I know you said you were Polish and definitely look Slavic so I don't think that'll be an issue. Religion doesn't really matter, as there's a nice mix of Traditional Catholic and Pagan in our group. I'm the only Pagan that belongs to a group, Asatru Folk Assembly to be exact, the rest are kinda a mix of Slavic and Germanic Pagan. No Christcucks or 'we wuz vikangs' types though in our group.

	But if you're not onboard with the Polak stuff I have a group of friends, more or less a pol party type group, that I'd like you to be part of.
