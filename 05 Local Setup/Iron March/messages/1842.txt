<p>I will give this question some time before responding, for it requires further thought.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="582" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Well, from a perspective of moral character, I'd generally agree with you (although of course this works better when the officers have been raised in a fascist culture already and know their responsibilities). From a more practical perspective, however, the military would lack the expertise to actually run the government. Perhaps the military would serve an overseeing role and leave the details to statesmen?</div></blockquote>
<p>In the first Fascist rule, they would be the leaders, while specialized statesmen would be appointed as subordinates. The point would be for the Administrative branch to be developed to specialize high ranking officers in different political domains. It would progressively become a Stratocracy. Firstly a semi-Military government, then a Military Junta and finally a Stratocracy.</p>

<p>To quote Hitler:</p>
<p>"<span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Let them be hard, but never unjust</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:12px;">, above all let them never allow fear to influence their actions, and </span></span></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>set the honour of the nation above everything</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:12px;"> in the world. Finally, let them be conscious of the fact that our task, that of continuing the building of a National Socialist State, represents the work of the coming centuries, which places every single person under </span></span></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>an obligation always to serve the common interest and to subordinate his own advantage to this end</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:12px;">. I demand of all Germans, all National Socialists, men, women, and all the men of the Armed Forces, that they</span></span></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong> be faithful and obedient unto death to the new government and its President. </strong></span></span></span>"</p>
<p>I view the State as a father, and not mother, archetype. It will be strict, but for the greater good and not out of sadism nor personal gains. It will be harsh out of love.</p>

<p>Through honesty. Instead of trying to mask a rigged voting system and end up like the 'voting system' of a Communist regime, you must explain to the people that they do not have the necessary expertise to have a say in the State's decisions.</p>
