	No problem friend, we all have our duties.

	I have seen the videos you linked on your blog and read some of the articles using google translate. Damn, I thought that those Negroes are from Southern Algeria but the cities you mentioned are almost all in the Northern region. What's the situation? Is there any chance for a small-scale RAHOWA? Do the Nigroes have Algerian citizenship or they are just illegal immigrants?

	I don't think we can find an appointment what would work for all of us, that's why I want to have our discussion here (it looks like we can have a conference with this mailing system too). I still lack the security too.

	About Salah al-Din al-Bitar, Wikipedia also states that he was a Sunni. FascistKurd is somewhat against Arabs and Islam because of the conflict between them and the Kurds, so that's natural - but he is a very clever guy and also a very spiritual one. I have talked with him a lot and it looks like that he will be able to defeat his hatred. Don't forget that this is an important mission of ours: we must help the Fascist cause every time and <em>everywhere</em>.

	You are right about that Kurdistan today is a geopolitical tool in the hands of the global powers, but that applies to a lot of states there. Don't forget the heroic Kurds fighting against the ISIS in Syria. I don't know much about what's going on there (the half-Algerian member envisions a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/SadheeSYRIA.jpg" rel="external nofollow">Greater Syria or Levant</a> for example), that's why I want to talk with you guys.
