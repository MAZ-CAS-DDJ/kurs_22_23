<p>I should also add, that when a deity is worshiped, it is not a literal "sky daddy" as a lot of atheists put it, or Christians seem to think of it. The gods are abstractions of the forces of nature. For example, when one worships Odin, they are praising one or all of the aspects he represents, such as wisdom, the mind, war, etc.</p>
