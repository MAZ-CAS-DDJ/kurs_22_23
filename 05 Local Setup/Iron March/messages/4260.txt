<p>I agree with 2 official languages. In Richmond you can take your driving test in Mandarin and signs for businesses are usually in Chinese first and English second because of the large Chinese population but I think that is acceptable as you still always have the option to use English (and French as well for government things).</p>
<p>I don't know what you think makes Europeans so different from Canadians of European descent. Europe was once an untamed continent quite similar to Canada (although not as large). We're still biologically speaking the same. Over time a new identity may evolve but not iif you forget where you came from. All modern European cultures evolved from older cultures of the same blood and carry much of the same ideas.</p>
<p>Canada may be large enough to host 'good productive minorities' as long as they stay a minority. It's to everyone's advantage that these populations remain separate as well, so each can retain their culture. It will also reduce any conflict or ethnic tensions that may otherwise be experienced.</p>

<p>I agree with your view on the media though. That has and always will be America's main method of cultural projection.</p>
<p>A suggestion for your party platform for banking would be the elimination of usury (the charging of any interest on money lent). Muslim states already loan interest free money to their citizens. In the past usury was outlawed almost everywhere and only the Jews engaged in it. I may be preaching to the choir if you're a fascist but I believe usury to be an immoral practice.</p>
