<p>Thank you for the kind words.  I'm not a militant anti-abortionist, though I think it's wrong.  As John Calvin said "the womb is the place where a child ought to be the most safe".  I just believe in the minimum of standards of duty to God and to the Nation.  Liberalism bears the seeds within itself for it's own destruction.  It creates the environment for the exploitation of the hyper-capitalist class and at the same time condemns it.  It's a true mental disorder.</p>
