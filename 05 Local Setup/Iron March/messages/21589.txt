	Hey Baly, I just wanted to thank you, and also to apologize. I know there is no excuse, and I really appreciate your harsh but fair assessment. My entire fucking life I have just been given free passes "Oh Svart you didn't mean to", "Oh Svart its okay I forgive you." etc etc. It's infuriating, I don't deserve anything in my life. Everything good I have in my life I feel like I don't deserve, and that's not to say I couldn't deserve it one day. I think maybe I can improve. But I just get free passes and free rides and idk man. I aint special, everyone goes through bad shit, I just need to find the strength within me to overcome it and the reason why I left wewelsburg and shit is because I felt like, rightfully so, that I am a burden. if I can't/won't change, at least at this point in my life, then the least I can do is not expose people I care about to me when I am such a little worm writhing in his own filth.<br /><br />
	I'm drunk and rambling, I just want you to know I appreciate all the advice you've given, I am sorry, for not being a good comrade, and for being a weak faggot, and that I hope to become stronger so I can talk to all you guys again and help develop EH. <br /><br />
	Thank you again Baleygr, <br /><br />
	"god" bless
