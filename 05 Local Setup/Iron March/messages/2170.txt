<p>I would be interested in reading this paper some day.</p>
<p>Also, I suppose I don't know Ã‰tat so well. How is he a coward?</p>
<p>Is that because of Canada's population?</p>
<p>I find that one of the Russians is very anal about things and difficult to discuss with. His user name is in Russian, so I am not sure what it means. He acts autistic about his moderator duty sometimes.</p>
<p>The amazingneard is not very intelligent. I can't say I don't like him as a person because I don't know him, but he is unrealistic in his approach to Catholicism.</p>
<p>He doesn't really debate at all. But at least he is not autistic or anal.</p>
<p>Other than that, actually I have found more positive interactions than negative. Panzertanz is a smart man and he will intelligently debate you if you are honest. NSP will also.</p>
<p>Most of the admins seem to have a good humour about things.</p>
<p>I like IronMarch because even most of the nationalists who are not interested in intellectual thought behind Fascism or National Socialism are smart.</p>
<p>What about you? How has your experience been so far?</p>
