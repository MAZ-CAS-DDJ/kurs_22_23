<p>Well, I don't really have much to do. Past few months were mostly wake up too late, go to school, sleep in every class, go back home, eat something, turn the PC/Laptop on, start reading/downloading random shit, then some porn till 2 hours after midnight, then hit the bed. It's boring, but not as boring any other alternatives that present themselves. But look at the bright side - if you don't indulge yourself in the most mainstream activities of current generation, it probably means you're somewhat normal. Right? Right.</p>

Ironmarch gathered a several hundred euros donation to build a website, the designers hired tried to run away with the cash and Alex hired a private investigator.<p>Torren got arrested a billion times, almost died in a firefight with the cops, anarchists tried to get him by telling their agent inside of the military base Torren lives in to arrest him, but Torren backtraced them and the anarchist leader will get tried to espionage and will be buttraped because this all happened in North American Aerospace Defense Command.</p>
<p>I also stopped seeing that one girl after one very adventurous night during which my friend got arrested and charged, we blacked out and I woke up in a room with furniture throw all around, and the bed I was lying on was covered in blood and in addition to that all my pockets were covered in tobacco.</p>

<p>You sure this is all not just a elaborate dream induced by said tobacco or some random slightly stronger stuff? I'm just saying, you know me, conspiracy nut and all.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">I haven't touched that topic much, will have to check.</span> Not really sure what the hell that guy was about, but still, few hearty snickers here and there were had, so job well done.</p>
<p>But yeah mate, till next time, which will probably will be tomorrow. I say probably because my dear old oversized calculator seems to be rather bitchy lately. As fucking always.</p>
