	Well I'm happy that you had some great extended family to help you out, and he was very lucky to have you and all them around too.

	Was getting kicked out related to your beliefs? And yes definitely, you absolutely have to live by your beliefs and values. I've had my ups and downs with my father but a lot of my foundation come from him. So later on we could definitely talk freely and we shared a lot of the same beliefs-he just would shy away from calling himself anything. Mother really doesn't care, sister would go full autism talking to either of us.
