<p>Sorry, I don't know anything about the militia movement in California. Good luck, though. If any place needs a militia movement it's SoCal! </p>
<p>One suggestion: know your stuff before you get involved. Hardcore (hard corps) militiamen often don't have patience with young bloods who don't know one end of a rifle from another. Be in great -- not good, but GREAT -- physical condition and develop a good understanding of tactics, particularly the science of setting up and carrying out ambushes.</p>
<p>Again, good luck.</p>
