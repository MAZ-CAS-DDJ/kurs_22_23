	Hey Xav, been a while. I just wanted to ask real quick if you can worship the old Germanic pantheon of Gods even if you are not Germanic? (I'm Celtic) Also, sorry to pry but I remember you saying one time you were raised Lutheran, so do you go to church or did you go other to worshiping the German pantheon? Sorry, to ask, I'm just curious how that works? Also, would you mind sharing sometime some specific worship rituals or prayers that you do? Anyways, all of this was just a brief side note. The real reason I am writing is to let you that I am about to start <em>On War</em> and was still wondering if you wanted my opinion when I am finished.
