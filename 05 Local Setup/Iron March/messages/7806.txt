<p>Depends, eastern europe is a wide term. It's generally safe, especially in big cities. I'd recommed you Budapest or Belgrade (Serbia in general). It's much cheaper, especially Serbia is really cheap. You'll get tons of good food and drink for peanuts. Budapest is a really cool city, cheap too. Tourism in Europe is safe in general unless you're going to visit some notorious neighbourhoods where there's nothing to see anway. Tourism in EE is well developed, it's organized and there's nothing that can happen. My city (Ljubljana) is realy tourist friendly and is generally safer than Western European big cities with all those immigrant gangs there. Most of organized crime in Eastern Europe is indeed organized and deals with high-level crimes, not with street bullshit, while skinhead/hooligan gangs don't bother tourists.</p>
