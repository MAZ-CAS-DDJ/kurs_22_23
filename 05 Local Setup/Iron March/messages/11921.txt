When 'printing' on the dollar bills, are you really just scanning them? Also, what type and strength of tape are you using to hold the money in place? Final question; have you tried feeding them in any sort of machine, such as vending machine yet, with success?</p></div></div></blockquote>

<p>You are not scanning them, you are printing on top of the bills themselves (overprinting is the technical term).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I use normal scotch tape to hold them in place, nothing ultra fancy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And last but not least, I have not tried to use it on a vending machine, but I will try.  Most these days use the magnetic strip test to tell, or only read the face side.  I will post results with the vending machine later.</p>
