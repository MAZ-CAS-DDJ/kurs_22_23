<p>Hey Harrison,</p>
<p>Blackshirt 13 here, I saw your response to my post on the thread Fascist View on Freemasons. So, I am going to ask you the same question that asked Adam. Are you and others going to condemn me for a mistake I made in the past? As I said that is the past and I am a proud and committed Fascist now and forevermore. Please let me know if you get this.</p>
<p>Hail</p>

<p>PS This is not meant to be confrontational, I'm only curious on your thoughts. </p>
