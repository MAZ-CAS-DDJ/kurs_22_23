<p>I do not intend to rectify anything, I was just informing you that I was observing the IRC.</p>
<p>I didn't post that publicly in the relevant thread which should show that I am not intending to be malicious although I do want to correct you on one thing.</p>
<p>I didn't mock the concept, I merely said it was shocking.</p>
<p>Also, I would appreciate it if you would not talk to me in a condescending manner with comments such as "your friendly moderation staff"</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I considered whether my comment was accurate, after review of the thread I decided that it was. You, were not mocking no, but others were. I will clarify if you wish. And my sincerest apologies. I am having some personal health issues and am not feeling my best. It was not my place to condescend to you.</p>
