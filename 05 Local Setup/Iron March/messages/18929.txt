	That's quite interesting, how well do you know your ancestry? I have a couple of lettersÂ next to my monitor still waiting for me to digitize them. They are from Vietnam written by my grandfather's brother (he was on a diplomatic mission for the reds), and it is his family where my Polish and Swabian blood comes from. They say our Polish ancestor was from a noble family but as the youngest son he couldn't take anything from the heritage so off he fucked and later became a sailor - the guy from Vietnam mentions him in one of his letters, that he went to the same port in which the sailor dwelt for some time before the world wars.

	Man, maybe I should go back to work on a ship.
