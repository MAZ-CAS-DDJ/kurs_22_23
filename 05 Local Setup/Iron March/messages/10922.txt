<p>I am just asking you to look at coriolanus's (I guess his former forum name was fascism=fun) first reply to my first post in that cancer thread. Instead of explaining things (what this forum should be partly for) he starts throwing insults all around. I am not too bothered by that, I mean it is cancer it exists for shitposting, but I am when he gives me the title "Subversive Racial Anomaly", thats a fucking insult. What happens in cancer should stay in cancer, also what your personal opinion is shouldn't affect his obligations as mod. I want that title down, also I didn't bother to contact him since he would ignore me anyways.</p>
