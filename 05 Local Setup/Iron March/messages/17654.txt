	I considered Syria as well but all you'd be doing is helping Muslims fight Muslims. The Ukrainian conflict is edgy simply bc I'm not a fan of whites vs whites. But they're picking back up from what I hear. Romania may be another stomping ground. They're peacefully ousting their parliament there but who knows what that can turn into once NATO gets their fingers in it. There's a lot of unknowns, especially in what can happen in 4 years time.
