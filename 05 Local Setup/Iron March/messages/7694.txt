<p>Why would I want even more different ethnicities within our realm when we still have trouble with those who exist within our current borders?</p>
<p>Multi-national empires have shown themselves to be extremely self-destructive. What we want is stability.</p>

<p>You want the Turks to have a unified state and religion and it should be a great power, for this to happen your ideal state would want to reclaim terrorties and create a racial heirarchy, using the Caliph title is a means of controlling a billion Muslims. Besides the Middle East was stable under the Ottomans.</p>

<p>Yes of course, but we will reclaim territories that we have held as "ours". We will reclaim territories where our people actually exist(Karabagh, East Turkestan, amongst many). Our forefathers had the idea of "nizam-ı Alem", bringing justice to the realms, however we have seen that neither our justice nor our presence is welcome, not even amongst our co-religionists.</p>
<p>150 years from now on, Arabia will be nothing more than a piece of worthless desert. I'd rather have an ethincally homogenous country.</p>
