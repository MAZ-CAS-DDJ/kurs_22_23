<p>Yeah. I'd take things with a grain of salt as well. Zeigler said as well that it is just an ''intro'' or w/e. I got a couple of other older and more in depth books as well which I can send over skype later on if you're still interested in that. Not read them fully, but that whole subject seems more philosophical than ''scientific''. You said you had a couple of weird experiances or w/e a while back right? Books can explain experiances and vice verse I suppose if you can sort the shit from the gold. But as said, we're like 19-20 lol.</p>
