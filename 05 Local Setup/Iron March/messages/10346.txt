<p>I never even applied to college/uni once I got out of high school so this will be my first time doing it other than some meteorology classes I took due to being a nerd.</p>

<p>My problem with the site was (and is), you know, on one level, it's all roleplaying to an extent, and that's fine because it's how people explore ideas, they try them out, but people started actually getting hurt. People end up seriously thinking it's ok to do meth or go shooting people who are ~enemies of the white race~ or whatever. Even recently there was that Dylann Roof bs, you just know he was from /pol/ or something. That stuff spooked me and I ended up feeling like I was talking to a wall when I started telling people it was time to tone it down. I was also a little bit too popular and I felt like I had an obligation to support some things I no longer supported, so that was frustrating too. I feel a little more comfortable now just saying what I'm thinking though.</p>
