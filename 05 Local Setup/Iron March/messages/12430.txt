Good on you, and I absolutely agree. No use being the 'bigger person' when it's fight or be conquered. Regarding the Saturday thing, how many people are expected? Is there a possible police or antifa presence? Should I bring anything? I've just never demonstrated before, and the idea of a demonstration with a formal dress code sounds especially puzzling.</p></div></div></blockquote>

<p>There should be around 100+ on Saturday, but could be a surprise with more due to widespread promotion on websites/social media. The police will be there to keep order, London police are usually alright with us as they view the Reds and Antifa as troublemakers/rioters. I wouldn't worry too much about dress code, casual or smart is ok. Hope you can make it.</p>
