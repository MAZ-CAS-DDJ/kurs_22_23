	Crashing your life with no survivors is not exactly radical as much as it is reckless. In regards to religion / tradition we're secular. There are people with respects for paganism and people with respect for christianity. You will get shit hung on you no matter what you follow. We're the least tolerant of atheists, or traitors like muslim converts.
