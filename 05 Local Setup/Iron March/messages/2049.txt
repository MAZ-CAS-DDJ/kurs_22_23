<p>I can't speak for other NazBol's but Che Guevera actually played a large role in my conversion to Nazbol. So did Saul Alinsky, Eduard Limonov and Otto Strasser. The thing about NazBols, is that they are usually nationalists who have adopted Marxist economics. They also have a kind of nationalistic internationalism if that makes any sense. This can range from socialist types to the hardline communists. If you want to see two geat NazBols, look at Che Guevera and Ho Chi Minh. </p>
<p>This is a NazBol site which I've like for a long time.</p>
