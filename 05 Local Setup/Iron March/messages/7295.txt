<p>Glad to know. A lot of people agree with me reallyand have told me so, it is just the adminship derailed the thread and most people have mixing feelings and no time. KU is only in it to troll, alex wants to act like he has a dick so he basically attacks anything I do, ben says he agrees withÂ  the principle but can't see it work in practice. That basically means they get to throw my thread in cancer (for no reason) and let loose the spergs on me, while pumping a couple dozen likee points out of it. as long as I get my point across and the more intelligent members read it, I really don't care. Seeing that it took me a few long months of reading to fully come over to Aryanism I am sure plenty of people will as well, and like me will strike down some more retarded things the website puts forward. I personally think they are to pretentious to work as a propaganda platform, but are a good website where a select few can assess their principles. My main point of agreement with them is that the struggle needs to be of world-wide scope, and universal, and that the real motive for all politics are moral and religious principles, so that politics need to uphold them foremost. this does not mean you necessarily talk about it in your political platform or propaganda. Other than that, the tranny stuff, nelson mandela, golden dawn, I have already written on extensively. I encourage you to get involved with nationalist politics or whatever politics you feel closest to and platform Aryanism there in whatever way works (so not how I did it, but I really didn't have many choices, and just decided to go full-on direct.)</p>
