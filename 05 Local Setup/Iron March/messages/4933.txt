<p>You know it. Part of me has given up the fight here and taken to just looking out for myself and my family first and foremost and just living life and letting people ge ton with their own lives. A differing opinion only does so much, the person has to make the leap themselves; I'm under no illusion that many people in this country will have to clash with us. It needs to be done in a crafty way; look at the circumstances which led to Hitler and Mussolini and their methods. Rockwell set a good foundation for a new movement; I think it's vital to pick up from where he left, which is where I've been coming in with the infiltration of CI groups, that was one of Rockwell's aims. The great thing about Rockwell is even the people who hated him cheered and laughed with him when he gave his speeches. It's a great shame that he was assassinated.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that the UK is planning to add esotericist/occult websites to the filter; they only ever block things that they think is a threat to their power. It's no coincidence that the vast majority of occultists and esotericists are fierce racists and anti-semites, a classic example being Julius Evola; even Mussolini was a little bit afraid of Evola. A lot of people have been taking an interest in alchemy, magick and theistic satansim lately as well; not just goths looking for a hobby either. Anybody who opts in is setting themselves up for suspicious activity who can be considered a "threat" at any time. It's a good job I use tor, socks5 proxies, truecrypt and have a ton of flash drives.</p>
