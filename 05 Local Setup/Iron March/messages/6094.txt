<p>My great grandmother came here from the South of Romania. She died before I was born and my grandmother never cared to talk about our family's history unfortunately. It is most likely we immigrated from Albania or Turkey at some point, because we are Bektashi and our school of islam is usually found in Turkey or Albania.</p>
<p>Are you from the same region?</p>

<p>Ah, excuse me for that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am curious, how come you can trace your heritage back to Romania? Are you the descendant of Turks or Bulgarian converts from Dobrogea?</p>
