<p>July is fun here, we'll have the gym reserved for us the whole summer like the last year, you can join some of our trainings if you want, it's usually fun. The cool thing about our scene here is that it's really diverse, you have guys who're more into sports (we have some good martial arts specialists) and some guys who're into drugs and party lifestyle or a mixture of both, so it depends what you want to do, you can always find a good company. There's always something going on.</p>

<p>This summer a guy I knew from the internet from some football forum came here this summer for few days, a Bosniak guy who's actually a fascist. He likes Evola and Italian fascist stuff because he's a fan of Roma, otherwise he used to be member of Sarajevo ultras (Sarajevo and Roma have the same colors, that's why this sympathy), now he lives in Australia. It's funny how guys on internet who like Evola are autists but in real life I only met cool people who were into Evola. This Bosniak guy for example's really tough, your typical Bosnian thug, Bosnian Muslims always had reputation of being great warriors, back in Austria-Hungary for example they formed an elite batallion in WW1 Isonzo Front which often engaged in hand to hand combat.</p>

<p>Anyway, this guy really loved our city and our company, we had a crazy party that night, drinking till 3AM on a private party in our pub playing fascist/RAC music so loud it was you could hear it one the street and then we had an after party at my place till afternoon the next day, obviously there were tons of "snow" involved. We had some funny conversations about Islam and Balkans and other shit, it's never boring when fascists are around.</p>

<p>We could also meet in Serbia, top destination, especially if you've never been to Balkans before, or make some Balkan tour together (Bosnia and Serbia and perhaps a bit of Croatia too). I speak the language fluently so we won't even look like outsiders and we have some cool contacts in these countries. Local girls aren't anything special in terms of looks but they have top personality, I always had the most fun with Balkan girls.</p>
