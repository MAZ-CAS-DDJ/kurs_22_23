<p>She has to be 10/10 otherwise it's not worth going into relationship, as simple as that. Also, 98% of men in this modern Western society are garbage, why the hell would it be any different with women? It's just that you don't see negative traits so quickly because unless you're some sort of homosexual you usually don't hang out with women as friends and you don't get to know all the hypocritical and manipulative tricks most women use, you mostly learn it the hard way through time. People complain when men hit women but sometimes it's well deserved if she uses manipulation all the time and behaves in this "I know you won't punch me so I can do whatever you want" fashion. I never hit a woman myself but some of the guys from my crew did, big deal. Anyway, falling in love is such a false emotion, unless you don't really know someone you can't really be in love, but some guys just go crazy about some random women.</p>

<p>But yeah, you're 100% right, women who have this high-handed attitude are most likely whores who're fucked all the time and then think it is because they're hot, while in reality most men would fuck anything especially when drunk (I prefer those women who see cock a lot but at least understand that it's not because they're special but because they're willing to do it). I really can't stand some of these whores, even if you start some random conversation they think you're hitting on them and then behave cocky and arrogant, but if you approach some really good looking women then it speaks volumes about you- it's confidence, pride and going only after the best things, especially if you're not the best looking guy on the planet and it's visible that your self-confidence isn't based on looks. Even if you get rejected who gives a shit really, real man is shameless most of the time, especially in front of women.</p>

<p>You should visit Argentina, they have the best hooligan/fan scene on the planet, by far. They have really cool chants and crazy atmosphere, I especially love the Buenos Aires clubs (not only the "big 5" but also the smaller "barrio" clubs). I'll definitely go to Argentina one day and watch some games. I'd really love to be part of that scene, football, incidents and passion just as it should be.</p>

<p>I like smaller clubs from Buenos Aires area because they seem to have some really crazy hooligans, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Iw9pN2Tdic" rel="external nofollow">Chacarita Juniors</a> for example is notorious for having one of the most dangerous gangs even though they're almost always in lower divisions. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLERoAQn6eY" rel="external nofollow">Nueva Chicago</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCVyNR_aPWs" rel="external nofollow">Huracan</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thcms2AmNnw" rel="external nofollow">All Boys</a> are cool too. These are all cult clubs.</p>
