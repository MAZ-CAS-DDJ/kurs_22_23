<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I have, as of late, been looking into National Socialist ideology. All I can find so far is Mein Kampf -which is too Teutocentric- and a bunch of thuggish shitheads fantasizing about Holocaust 2.0. Are there any respectable NS groups or American material you can point me towards?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,</p>
<p>Dux</p>
