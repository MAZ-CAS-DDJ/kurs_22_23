<p>Yes, I've heard of Matthias Alexander Castren, but I didn't know of his connection with Turanism.</p>

<p>As for the different type of ideologies, I'd say that this is the one thing that is the problem of nationalists everywhere. We care about the same nation, but in different ways.</p>
<p>For example, I'm a pure Turkist, I adhere to a heritage based ideology, but there are three types of nationalism that exist in Turkey.</p>
<p>This hinders us from becoming a solid force in the face of centre-left and centre-right ideologies, as it does against liberalism and socialism.</p>

<p>I'd very much like to hear how you see the future of the Finns in a future State based on the ideal of Turan.</p>
<p>Would you say that it would give you more opportunities than the EU, or would you rather be an affiliated state, than a part of Turan proper?</p>
