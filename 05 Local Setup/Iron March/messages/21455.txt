	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	as I have been in the military for some years and reading what some people are giving off themselfs, I can only shake my head.
</p>

<p>
	They think they read some childbooks and then THEY can change a society not willing to be changed.
</p>

<p>
	Read here for entertainment and to get an overview what books to read for building your own opinion.
</p>

<p>
	Sorry for my not so good english, but I am from an other continent...
</p>

<p>
	regards,
</p>
