<p>I was going to post this on the G.Dawn thread but I don't wish to derail it.</p>
<p>So, as a Turanist do you view Kemal as your country's founder and savior and all that jazz or are you an Ottomanist? It seems like a Turk can't be both this days.</p>

<p>Well, there is no such thing as Ottomanism anymore. The idea was struck down during and before WWI erupted. Yusuf Akçura, the person who wrote the manifesto of Turkish nationalism clearly stated the fact that the Christian minorities aswell as the Muslim minorities wanted to pursue their respective national goals.</p>
<p>So, the author stated, that the people who founded the Ottoman empire, namely the Turks, should abandon Ottomanism and Islamism, and instead pursue nationalism to reform the Ottoman empire into a nationalist state, since it was evident that Ottomanism was clearly not presenting a unifying identity.</p>
<p>Islamism on the other hand was struck down when the Arab revolt hit the scene, in addition to the Albanians and other muslim minorities revolting aswell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In such a case, I do view Atatürk as the founder and savior of the country, mainly due to the fact that he managed to do away with the one thing that stood before the creation of a nationalist state, the Ottoman empire, who was actually based on a dynasty, rather than the nation from which the dynasty sprung out from.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So he did away with the Ottoman Dynasty, abolished the irrevelant Caliphate, and laid the basis of Turan itself, as Turkey was to become the only surviving Turkic country in the world until the Soviet Union collapsed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, given all these, I do accept the Ottoman empire as a part of my heritage, with good and bad, ups and downs, it was our empire, and no one else can and would take credit for it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We alone paid its war debts. None of the many nation states that have declared its independence have aided us in this, meaning they have renounced whatever rights they had on the Ottoman heritage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The modern day "Ottomanists" are nothing but idiots, their version of the Ottomanism means to merely unite Turkey with the Arab nations down south, which would mean that we would become a tiny minority amongst a sea of Arabs, and these fools would like to think that we would still constitute the "ruling warrior elite" as we did before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Atatürk's ideology, well, today, the term "Kemalist" is not the same term that was used during the aftermath of WWI. Back then, it was mainly used to denote the Nationalists, with Mustafa Kemal being the leader, so they named the movement after him, however neither he, nor anyone else at that time used this term to denote the Turkish nationalist cause.</p>
<p>The term was later popularized during the Inönü era, and was presented as an alternative to Turkish nationalism, and later on became affiliated with the centre-left politics. Its a very vague "ideology". It has no basis whatsoever, and is based on pragmatism instead of a solid idea and literature.</p>
<p>Atatürk himself stated his ideology as only "Turkish nationalism" based on the ideas of nationalist-liberal(unrelated to the libtards of today) thinkers of the time like Yusuf Akçura and Ziya Gökalp. He had nothing to do with the left-influenced ideological cesspool they call Kemalism today.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We want Turanism mainly due to the fact that we are aware that the Ottoman empire collapsed because it had too many non-Turkic ethnicities within it.</p>
<p>Many were those who had a strong national identity like the Greeks, so we only wish to be amongst ourselves, and with our own people, instead of ruling over others like the Ottomans.</p>
