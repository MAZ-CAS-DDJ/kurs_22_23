<p>I am certainly a loner. I have honestly never met any fascists in person. And unfortunately for me, blacks who generally are nationalists are into Marxist bullshit and constantly bitch about the "white power stucture." If I even attempted to explain to them that blacks are better suited to create a National Socialist economy in Africa instead of complaining and draining the economy in the US, they would think I was insane. If I ever mentioned the word fascism to any of my friends, they would probably look at me with a "nigga what the fuck" expression on their face.</p>

<p>But yeah, I'll keep lurking and shit at least.</p>
