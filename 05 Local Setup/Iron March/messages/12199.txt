<p>Thanks. And no I don't really get questioned for it. Although, one of my professors noticed onetime (he has been the only one so far) and we had a bit of a conversation, so he knows that I am a Fascist, of course my academic adviser knows that as well, I am not exactly discrete about it. But anyways, even though the professor that noticed the pin calls him self a "Jeffersonian" when it comes to politics he did say he would not condemn me for my believes, so it was kind of cool to have a professor say that.      </p>
