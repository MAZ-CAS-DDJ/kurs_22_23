	Unfortunately I don't; I read a physical copy of it. I have found <a href="https://www.templetonpress.org/sites/default/files/2016-11/Cosmic_Blueprint.pdf" rel="external nofollow">the first few pages</a> from another book by the same author, you may want to read through it to know what to expect. I recommended the <em>Mind of God</em> because it is a quite good introduction to the topics of science (mainly mathematics, physics, cosmology), religion and philosophy as it explains their inner logic from a scientific perspective. A nice starter pack and a good guidance so to speak. Usually I compare it to the works of Stephen Hawking except those are much more biased.
