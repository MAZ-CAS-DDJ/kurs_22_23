<p>Hi there, met with your lot in Bristol over the weekend, real inspiring and top stuff. Have plenty of propaganda to assist in spreading this throughout the South West. The racial demographic here in Devon and Cornwall makes it seem like one of the last "bastions of hope for white nationalists" as a Plymouth based UAF leader once said. </p>
<p>Anyway, it's good to see you're taking over and getting the site back on its feet. If there's anything that needs doing, I'd be happy to help. Although manpower usually isn't required with regards to digital issues, the offer stands.</p>
<p>Sieg heil </p>
