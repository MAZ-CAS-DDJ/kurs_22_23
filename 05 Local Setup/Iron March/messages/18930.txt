	From my fathers side, something like 4 kinship levels i think? From a period where they had names like Antal, Elizabeth and Franz. I didn't researched my mothers side that well, I know only of grandparents. I have family tree of my fathers side finished, now I only need to complete my mothers. They were all simple people.
