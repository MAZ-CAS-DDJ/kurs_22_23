<p>Well, I do have Skype but I use it very rarely, I don't even remember the username and password. I don't always have time-I post on the forums whenever I take a short break from my studies.</p>

<p>And well, I personally think that every nation has their own particular brand of nationalism, with their respective roots. However this site advocates the type of nationalism that arose in pre-WWII era nation states as a reaction to both communist and capitalistic agendas, that were hailed with different names in different countries, based on different ethnic identities, but revolving around similar concepts such as authoritarianism, statism and etc, marked by a similar approach to economics, and being led by a charismatic leader of some sorts. It became commonplace to call them with the name of fascism due to the fact that this form of organized anti-communist nationalist movements first erupted in Italy, and it was carried on by leftists to this day, by which they apply the term to anyone who is not of their form of thought.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Ottoman empire, my maternal side were Turks that emigrated from Anatolia to Romania, and then simply went back in the 20th century. So I do have one side of my family in the Balkans still, living in a Turkish village that I never visited, nor have knowledge about.</p>

<p>I don't use Skype often, but if you wish you may add me on facebook, and we can converse there, but if you'd rather stay anonymous, we can continue through this site.</p>
