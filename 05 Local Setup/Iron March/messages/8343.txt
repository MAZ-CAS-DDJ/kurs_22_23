<p>I'm a bit of a hacker, and my gf and I are setting up a movement focused around anthral living and camping, a sort of rural equivalent to the urban activities NA seem to be engaging in. I wanted to help NA out however I can, and build  networks with them.</p>
<p>I'm 24, live in Leeds at present.</p>
