<p>I couldn't have put it better myself. As with you, all anti-Semites have ever done is increase my Jewish convictions, so bully for them.</p>
<p>Some of them are also quite funny. Have you by chance heard of Br. Nathanel, the ex-Jewish Orthodox priest who believes the Jews orchestrated everything from the Armenian Genocide to JFK's assassination? Or banjo_billy, who wrote a book under the name of G_d, because he think all Jews will fall over themselves to get a copy?</p>
<p>It's a crazy world out there.</p>
<p>Anyway, <em>what</em> about those Sumerians? You never got back to me on that question, and I'm anxious to know.</p>
