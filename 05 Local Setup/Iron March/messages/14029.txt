	Thanks. "Uncorrupted by modernity", I rather like that. What about the Freemason thing? Fascism and Der Fuhrer himself both condemn freemasonry. Even though, I left that behind, I am still tainted for having been one? Also, yeah I agree with your idea of boots on the ground in times of action and philosopher in times of inaction. I rather like the idea of a Soldier-Philosopher (for lack of a better term).
