	That's a tough one. Comes down a lot to the impression you give off and whether or not she finds you attractive. If you're already talking and you compliment a girl without dropping your spaghetti everywhere you should do fine. Randomly approaching someone and doing it is something only some people can do well I think. I personally don't do that but I will compliment them if we're already in a conversation and I feel like doing so. Never having had a date or a girlfriend can make it tough. I suppose you've gotta get used to talking to girls at some point, so it doesn't hurt to do that. Think you'll be able to control that spaghetti?
