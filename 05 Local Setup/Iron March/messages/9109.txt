You said Muslims couldn't have taverns, but isn't a tavern just like an inn/motel? How is this unlawful in Islam and why was it not allowed? Thanks in advance, and sorry for any typos, I'm on a phone and it won't even let me see everything I'm typing here.</p></div></div></blockquote>
<p>No, its nothing like it brother. Inns and hotels were in a seperate category, under "caravansarai", and "khan", and were quite distinct from taverns.</p>
<p>Since the consumption of alcohol is forbidden, so is its sale and production(except for non-recreational purposes). As such, this profession was usually left to the non-muslim subjects, mostly the Greeks, who ran the taverns. Coffee houses on the other hand, could and often would be ran by Muslims.</p>
<p>But throughout the history of the empire, both coffee and alcohol were banned a number of times.</p>
