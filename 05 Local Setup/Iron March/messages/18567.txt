	Hello, I recommend looking in "fashy dreams" to find people in your area or region, the best thing is to keep your opinions and identity a secret and only meet other supporters in public places. The guy who runs natalt.org recommended that I host meet-and-greets at bars or pubs, that's how to get started. You can probably find supporters on the Facebook group called Fashy Dreams: The new Reich, below is the full URL
