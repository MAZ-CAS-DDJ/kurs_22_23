			And your point is? The alt right is worth little to fascism. their petty squabble won't change a thing in our society as long as they have that tolerance of the system with the admiritaion of donald trump and such.

			I don't care about leftists or rightists. they both make up shitty political parties full of autistic rubbish. I want a FASCIST future, not neo con reactionary bullshit. aslo white identity politics don't work. that is why we must wage war against these political enemies and fill our nation full of integrity. I feel  you don't understand that being red pilled doesn't make you fascist or fanatical.

	Good for you. I want a future where men are men and women are women. And America becomes a ethno-nationalist state where white Europeans can dominate and decide their own fate. I don't care whether its fascism, trad-cons, various strands of identitarians or alt-right. What I care about is winning, and we can do it if we are all part of the culture war. You understand how the left has done it in the past, the alt-right is just being pragmatic. Egalitarianism is what holds all leftist garbage together. Sure Democracy and Capitalism where invented by leftist but it doesn't have to be dominated by them, any system can be coopted by external actors or modified to be ethno-nationalist. Christianity came from jews but it became distinctly European. You say identity doesn't work, I says its very effective. I feel that you don't understand pragmatism &amp; the fact that we are waging war. When everyone wants our head... yeah I feel pretty fucking fanatical.

	Trump had his foot in the door with anti-globalism &amp; won, Alt-right has their foot in the door with anti-egalitarianism &amp; we are winning culturally, then once we get a ethno-nationalist state in North America, what do you think comes after that cycle of winning? FASCISM! or new systems like epistocracy!

	Open Letter to the White Man: " What is the truth then, white man? The answer is in yourself. That is, in a nutshell, the purpose of this book. It is about identity, therefore it is not for the weak. It is for the last man, the lost man, operating covertly in the underground of internationalist despair."
