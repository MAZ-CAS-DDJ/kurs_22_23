<p>Faust and I are very glad to hear this! It's the same sort of sentiment we have been expressing to one another. And I'm pleased this is also the vision y'all have. It's good to have people across the country on the same page. Especially in good ol' Dixie. <br /> </p>
<div style="margin:0px;font-size:12px;font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><p>So after a bit of discussion. We wanted to ask a few questions. We are interested in starting a chapter up here where we are at. We are however curious as to how much autonomy groups have within the atomwaffen and how much is centralized. Would we have freedom in our aesthetic choices and ability to engage in other projects? What is expected of us overall? Obviously we're aware that it's not such a simple process. Being that people have to be vetted and all of the other important issues related to modern organizing. <br /><br />We were also curious as to if Atomwaffen is an American initiative. We saw that there were members in other countries, but a lot of what we saw was U.S based. </p></div>
