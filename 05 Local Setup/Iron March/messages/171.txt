<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You can find some material on our new party website <a href="http://integralistparty.zzl.org" rel="external nofollow">here</a>, Though the material for it is still not finished it has a blog and a section for the journal we produce called ATTACK. ATTACK is a journal produced by young britons mostly in their twenties, my articles are probably where you would best get an idea of what our attitudes and goals are.</p>
<p>The group was started when I collaberated with a philanthropist who indicated he wanted to seriously start a fascist political party in the united kingdom. at the time I was in college (2009) and the outfit was essentially like previous internet start up parties and didn't get anywhere - I began to question why there was little progress so since then I have been on a developing mission to find out how to make a contemporary movement succeed. I started attack as an experiment and it provoked interest among young people. Many of them were local to me so I organised meetings with them, and got to know them all. we eventually got shot of our former leader and started everything from scratch just a few months ago. The purpose of the party is now primarily for activism of a new kind. You can find the bones of this in our activism section, though it hasn't been reviewed or spellchecked.</p>
