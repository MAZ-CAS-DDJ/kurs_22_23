<p>Ok, well I will definately take a look at what you have when it comes along. If you are short for time, or rather want a more simple job you may want to think about the adapting work for the blackshirt articles as there are some very intelligent pieces. I don't mind if they are short. I would do them myself as light work but they seemed like such a good springboard for others.</p>
