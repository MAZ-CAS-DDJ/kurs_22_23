<p>Well, it's a bit mixed. Most of the Finns don't really mind Swedes, and a minority of Finns speak Swedish as their first language. There is, at the most, friendly rivalry between Swedes and Finns, constant joking about each other. But you are correct, mandatory Swedish isn't received all that well, but people mostly oppose teaching of Swedish, not Swedes themselves.</p>
<p>No stigma. If you voice your dislike/suspicion of Russians, you aren't gonna get screamed at for being "racisss". But still claiming Russia's gonna invade any second might get you a funny look.</p>
<p>There is strong sense of solidarity, even if you're not a nationalist. Even though the Finnic minorities in Russia aren't all that known to Finns due to the lack of contact and the distance, Finns in general feel brotherhood with Estonians due to very similar culture and language. During the Soviet times Finnish TV was pretty much the only way to get free information, and Finns, disregarding the strong control, regularly ventured behind the iron curtain to meet their brothers. Both countries have songs promoting our friendship.</p>
<p>According to my girlfriend, who is half-Udmurt, Udmurts and presumedly other Russian Finnic minorities look up to Finland due to its sovereignty, and apparently at least some of them visit or at least want to visit their cousins here in Finland.</p>
<p>Hungarian nationalists, I've noticed, hold Finland in high regard and I've spoken with many who praise Finland. Hungary sent extraordinery number of volunteers to Finland during the Winter War to help their brother nation under Soviet attack. Though Finns, due to distance, aren't as close with Hungarians as they are with Estonians, our shared blood is acknowledges and especially ethnonationalists have great respect for Hungarian people and culture.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
