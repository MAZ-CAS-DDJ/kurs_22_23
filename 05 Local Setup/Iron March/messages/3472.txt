<p>I noticed your Buckley quote and wanted to know your opinion of him?  I've been really getting into quite a few post-WWII conservatives like him, Revilo P. Oliver, Robert Welch, Sen. McCarthy, etc. Basically anyone who wanted to rid America of the communist trash that was coming in and ruining our values. I honestly think I am just an old school conservative but in this day, we need the strong arm of something a bit extreme to clean up this country</p>
<p>I'm also far more pro-market than before, if you'd enjoy discussing that. I see not much has changed here and it looks like it's still run by a bunch of kids with these lofty, pie in the sky ideals.</p>
