<p>Hello again, I added you and an admin called Goyles on Skype. I read your last message. I am wondering since your Russian or Ukrainian or Jewish... Not really sure... How do the Russian people view their government, not only Putin, but also Dmitry Medvedev and the Siloviki? I ask because I cannot find a single comprehensive analysis of the Russian government. Everything I read about the Russian government is written by a Western liberal.</p>
