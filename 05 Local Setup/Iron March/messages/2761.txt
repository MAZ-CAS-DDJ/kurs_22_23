<p>Not really, Fascism and any form of Nationalism is generally heavily frowned upon in this country. We're a country that was built on multiculturalism and we fought against Nazism, Fascism, and Imperialism in both World Wars. It will definitely take hard work and extreme progress to create a pro-Fascist/Nationalist government in the U.S.A. We would not be able to preach anything about race for the vast majority of the build up, or we would essentially loose all of our momentum.</p>
