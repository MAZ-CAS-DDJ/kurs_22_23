<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Also i have some question, if it is appropriate to ask now, not intended to offend you or him or any of the other admins, As a matter of fact, Alexander Slavors can be a little bit douchy sometimes, if it is for fun or seriousness i dont know, as i dont know him personally. If hes trying to act tough, wich i understand why he would.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>i have observed him and some of his replies to certain people and me who are <span style="color:#f0ffff;"><em>all Fascists</em></span> and not at any way an enemy of him or his ideological beliefs. and it seems like he cant talk on a polite way to people he disagree with or dislike.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let me compare it to this little fiction story, someone apparently likes cake, Slavros doesn't, instead of saying he doesn't like cake, he must <em>say that those who do can just go fuck them self and fucking die. </em> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You understand me right? Im not sure if hes trying to be hostile or its just ''for fun'' or whatever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Take care.</p>
