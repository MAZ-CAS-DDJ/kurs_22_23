	Hi, I’m one of the main organisers with National Action.
</p>

<p>
	Me and one of the main <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> graphic-designers are looking at creating infographics for the following:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="http://thezog.info/list-summaries/" rel="external nofollow">http://thezog.info/list-summaries/</a>
</p>

<p>
	However, Ben doesn’t want such a thing on the <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> website for legal reasons. So I want to know if a) you would want to use what we create as a feature on Noose, or b) if you think the Atomwaffen guys would be interested in putting it up online for us, as a joint-project?
</p>

<p>
	Chris.
