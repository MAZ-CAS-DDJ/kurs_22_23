<p>Watson is someone most geneticists would like to forget about rather quickly so they don't like to talk about him that much. It is that and also his work which suggested the low intelligence of Africans is due to genes (of which there are specific ones speculated to effect brain size and functioning, some of them are even listed on the erectuswalksamongst.us website). Watson was a very frank and to the point character and didn't care what anybody thought of him, this got the backs up of a lot of overly sensitive and ideological geneticists and they sought out to criticize him and his methodologies at every point and trip him up on an "aha! gotcha" moment, but he was too smart for them and they knew he was right anyway. In <i>Avoid Boring People</i> (2007) he pissed a lot of people off with his frankness as well. His view of religion could make a lot of people think he's arrogant as well and I personally think he's ignorant on those matters, but it doesn't take anything away from the rest of his work. He was a pure social darwinist, and believed completely in the price equation - which probably didn't bode well with every scientist either, in light of his other pinc views.</p>

<p>It's a combination of all of these but I'd say it's definitely the race stuff and the comments in avoid boring people which did it the most. A trend exists in the geneticist camp to cloud that there is ever such a thing as race although their own work proves the contrary and coupled with cranio-facial work and skeletal pathology it is an undeniable fact. They like to call races cline and blur the lines. Even the most well known and respected geneticist and without a doubt the most influential with regards to population genetics, Cavalli-Sforza, you see on the front of his main work a huge colour coded map of the main races (although he doesn't class American Indians as a separate race which we now know to be the most likely case) and then he will claim that the work is there to refute the idea of "race". He only does this to keep his funding from leftists at Stanford rolling in. However this is Cavalli-Sforza's description of that very map produced after he puts the raw data into something understandable:<br /><br />"The color map of the world shows very distinctly the differences that we know exist among the continents: Africans (yellow), Caucasoids (green), Mongoloids … (purple), and Australian Aborigines (red). The map does not show well the strong Caucasoid component in northern Africa, but it does show the unity of the other Caucasoids from Europe, and in West, South, and much of Central Asia."</p>

<p>Most geneticists know race is real and that it is influential and it's precisely this reason they keep hush hush on social policies and race itself so they can keep getting funded. It's a very crude field and has only been made worse by the evolutionary psychologists wanting to push their noses into it and of course the Jewish presence, both internal and external (funding). Of course, unless it is praising the Jews then of course they'll let the truth about race slip out.</p>

<p>I left the field to go into pharmaceuticals and vivisection (not something I really like that much), we don't really deal with the vivisection, we're mainly the suppliers of goods and research. For the time being until I pull all money together to buy some land and then I'm going to get flying lessons and become a pilot. I'll leave the science to the penheads. I spend a lot of my time which should be spent doing research flicking between tabs of this site, 4chon and using their great internet speeds to download torrents onto usb.</p>
