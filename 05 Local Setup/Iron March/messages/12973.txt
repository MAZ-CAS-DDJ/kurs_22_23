	Lol you have that problem too? theres a few tiny refuges of germanic culture in america and nonwhites like to embarrass themselves going there too. theres a little commune of german families near LA and every year they have an alpine market festival and oktoberfest, its always fun to go but the curious mexicans kinda ruin it. they also like to make a mockery of our holy days too ,the way blacks celebrate christmas here is almost comical

	it is pretty horrible lol. not sure why a record store though. nothing I ever immediately recognized as something from folklore, although im sure if seen maras. they were said to cause sleep paralysis as well. I see angels pretty often in my dreams, which is odd since im not christian, best dream I remember having I was lifted up into the clouds and saw angels and fire-snakes dancing in cathedrals made of storm clouds. Ive seen both thor and freya a few times.

	art classes in america are pretty awful...I guess if you can draw you carry the autism gene by default. yeah, ive sorta come to realize that I dont think liberals actually believe what they preach, they just preach it because it signals to everyone LOOK HOW GOOD A PERSON I AM! I CARE ABOUT THINGS! If society suddenly switched to become a fascist holy land I bet half these spineless cowards would start wearing black shirts

	really? I  wouldve expected long hair honestly, but I always thought pixie cuts were pretty cute, now I have to see! ah I understand. my family is pretty inquisitive too. sure, I have an old facebook account I deleted but I can still use it to chat to people. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010382587625" rel="external nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010382587625  </a>

	yeah, that is a little unfortunate. ive always been a bigger fan of bismarck. he made a few mistakes but i think he realized them by the time they took effect.  I had a similar problem when I became nationalist socialist, I always  respected erwin rommel before then and I wasnt sure what to think of him when I realized he was helping the enemy. must be the naivety of german nobility. they might, you never know with liberals. did you know herman the cheruscan was actually a  black transgender woman?

<p>
	im kidding, I dont know any liberals that know european history beyond slavery.

	I hope so, thats one of the goals of paganism, making your ancestors proud. but im not really perfect either hah. Im pretty proud Ive met you too, its good to know our race still has girls like you.  why do you say that? I cant imagine you have much to be ashamed of
