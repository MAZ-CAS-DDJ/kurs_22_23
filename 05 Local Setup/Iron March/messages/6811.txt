<p>Sadly yes when I first looked into my Russian heritage at a young age I always thought communism seemed great. Except I never fully accepted the whole equality thing since that's not how I was raised. I read the communist manifesto at a very young age and as such I believe that my belief system had to do with my age, now that I grew up a bit I can obviously see what is the better option and how the communists ravaged my country from the beginning.</p>
