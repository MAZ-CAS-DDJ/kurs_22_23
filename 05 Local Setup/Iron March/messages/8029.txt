<p>Not very good. He's the most liberal one yet, and that's saying something.</p>

<p>He trying get the peoples approval by being hip, trying to sell Catholicism to the heathen masses, what he dosen't know is that he is catering to Atheists and making Christianity even more of a joke. The Atheists want the Chruch gone, no matter how hard it tries to be liberal. That's why the Chruch needs a huge reform and take it back to the fire and brimstone days, one where the Chruch are strict on child abuse from priests and they actually care for the monarchy and poor.</p>

<p>Yeah, pretty much this. They can't actually modify Church doctrine in line with cultural marxism, as that's impossible, but the popes and a lot of the clergy in the last couple decades have done pretty much everything else.  I wouldn't worry though, cultural marxism doesn't last very long in any institution before collapsing in on itself.</p>
