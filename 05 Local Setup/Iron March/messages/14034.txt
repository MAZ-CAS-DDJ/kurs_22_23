	Wow that's a lot deeper than I thought. You certainly did take it very seriously when you left then if your family is so tied in with it. You did the right thing, so you can keep your chin up knowing that. Being forgiven for it would require understanding as to why you left it from her. She wouldn't understand unless she was blessed with the light of Hitler. Do you know why they were masons?
