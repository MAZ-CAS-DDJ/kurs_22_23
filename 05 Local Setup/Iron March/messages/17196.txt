	Good to hear everything is fine. I've decided that I will just go ahead and post the video. Like I said earlier I really don't expect anything though. And yeah I wasn't for sure if I had ever talked to you about my working-out. I am still working-out and am actually getting ready to go up to 120lbs on the bench-press. Which, I know isn't much but considering that I started out at the <em>very </em>beginning it is actually a good accomplishment.
