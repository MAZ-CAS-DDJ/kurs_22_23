	Hi Lucius. 
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for the contact, but this is a very vague invitation. 
</p>

<p>
	Can you please provide some more information on the "group" - its constitution, <em>raison d'être</em>, and so on? Also, did you get the name from a Spanish group, active in the early to mid 20th century?
</p>

<p>
	Regards,
