<p>Indeed and agreed, I see no reason for the rampant Anti-Semitism. It doesn't offend me personally, but it's becoming rather childish. ConsiderinG i enjoy early Italian Style Fascism, I'm not one to subscribe to many or the theories surrounding biological racism and Anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>And no I'm not Jewish, I was raised a Catholic and continue to identify as one for Cultural purposes. In truth though, I'm more of an Evolan Buddhist, minus his musing on 'The Aryans'.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the argument goes nowhere. Some people will believe what they want to believe forever.</p>
<p>Besides, everyone needs a good scapegoat... Blacks are disliked, but they are an unlikely threat because they have not really dominated intellectual fields.</p>
<p>A part of me really does wish that maybe all of us would just disappear from the planet. Maybe once every last Jew is gone and people continue to steal from each other, and suppress each other (without a "ZOG" anywhere to be found)... Maybe then they will recognize the truth of human nature.</p>
<p>As Fascists, you would think they would already recognize this truth...</p>
<p>Ah, that's very nice! I would go to Catholic midnight mass on Christmas with a friend of mine (who is Catholic) to a wonderful Basilica. The Catholic tradition has produced beautiful architecture, and it was always so beautiful. I wasn't raised to care about Christmas, but they make the day feel special and almost magical.</p>
<p>I hope this doesn't offend you, but somehow Catholic tradition seems comforting to me because it reminds me of Jewish service. The chants, the actions...</p>
<p>If I became a church-going Christian, I think I would have to be Catholic.</p>
