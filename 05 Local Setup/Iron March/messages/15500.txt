	Thank you, friend. Damn, I have only joined two days ago and I am already surrounded by good people. :)

	Magyar Gárda is not a big deal, they are like a poor version of SA. As Jobbik became a party, led by Traditionalists, Magyar Gárda started to revolt against them for the same things I preach: anti-Chauvinism. If you say you don't want to "kill every Romanians" and "get back our lost territories by war" than you are a traitor in their eyes. Magyar Gárda have served it's purpose and it is not needed anymore in this form, with rebellious, Röhm-like leaders and shit.

	What we need is a Supernational SS.

	Jobbik is in good hands, but it is still full with Chauvinists. Bad thing that Jobbik can't remove them from the party simply because they don't have enough people to run the organization. So now there is a quasi-agreement between the Traditionalists and the Chauvinists inside Jobbik, but the leaders are made up mainly from the former group.

<p>
	Our Arrow Cross-styled organizations are falling apart because of the same dilemma: some of them are attacking the Traditionalists, some of them are accepting them. I hope this is a sign of a total Traditionalist takeover in the Hungarian Right.

	We will surely stay in contact!

	God is great!

	P.S.: Check out the video I linked in the topic of "What kind of game do you think Iron March would make?" I want to know your opinions on it. Feels like a TOTAL CRUSADE/JIHAD FOR GOD'S GLORY.
