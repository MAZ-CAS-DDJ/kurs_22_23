	Wew lad… between the Christmas holiday, and school preparation, and work-related issues, I had almost zero time I could spend on IronMarch. I hope you understand. But, now I'm back again. And in response to your kind Christmas wish, I guess I could say:
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<span style="font-size:20px;">I wish you a way too belated <span style="color:#b22222;">J</span>O<span style="color:#daa520;">L</span>L<span style="color:#008000;">Y</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yald%C4%81_Night" rel="external nofollow">YALDA</a>, ya Christcuck.</span>
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Did you know about Yalda by the way? It's quite an interesting Iranic tradition. Although the way it's celebrated nowadays has really degenerated (and most people are doing it all wrong), I'm still really thankful that it never became extinct like the various European pagan traditions did. It's super degenerate nowadays, but at least it's still being observed and respected. Praise the Sun. (Or rather the Moon, in the case of this tradition.)
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, let's get down to it…

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Very true. So if history is the involution of time, and time doesn't exist, then all of history has already taken place, and we are all just small spokes within the greater samsaric wheel. Just as Alexander was leading his armies to India, so at that same moment Hitler was leading his to Russia, and both events happened at the precise same moment. It actually reminds me of that one passage in the Bible where Satan shows Jesus all the kingdoms and all the empires and everything in the world (or something along those lines), and Jesus rejects him, seeing how it's all just temporal.
</p>

<p>
	And by the way, this also returns me to the topic of Men In Time, Against Time, and Above Time. I've always wondered that if Germany had had a man Above Time (like Jesus), things would have turned out differently. Perhaps, in an organic society, you need all three of these types of men working together at the same time. You know, the way I think about it, I'd say: Fascist Europe had Men In Time (e.g. Mussolini, Mosley, the various "normal" groups like the Wehrmacht, etc etc) and it had Men Against Time (e.g. Hitler, Codreanu, the more esoteric groups like the SS, etc etc). However, I can't think of any Men Above Time existing in that era. Again, now that I think about it, I really believe that this could have been the one component that could have saved fascism from being completely overwhelmed after the war. What do you think? Perhaps if Evola had the Jihad al-Asghar (as we discussed earlier), maybe he could have created the necessary Above Time component for fascism to have survived the loss of WWII?
</p>

<p>
	Also, I personally never believed in free will anyway, but this even further strengthens my conviction that fate is unassailable and everything has already been written. What's your stance on this issue, by the way? I mean, if you take this conception of fate to its natural conclusion and apply it to your own life, what do you get? I guess you get something similar to that one quote I see sometimes in the IronMarch banners, where it's like: "You can either let history roll over you, or you can give your life for it." (Something like that.) Basically, we have to do what we must, because there's nothing else. Is that the final answer?
</p>

<p>
	Interestingly enough, the above conception of time as nonexistent is another thing that Wittgenstein also touches upon in the Tractatus.
</p>

<p>
	Tractatus 6.4311: "If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present. Our life has no end in just the way in which our visual field has no limit." (And by the way, this is also similar to the message of that dream video you just sent.)
</p>

<p>
	Also, note how this conception of "living in the present" can have two wildly different interpretations: a degenerate one, and a divine one. You could say "live in the present and enjoy life and do whatever you want and fuck around and none of it matters, because yolo". However, you could also say "live in the present to reach the pinnacle of your life's meaning and achieve bliss through never wasting any moment or any single second of it on frivolous things".
</p>

<p>
	You know, the more I think about these topics, the more I think that everything (literally everything) has both a degenerate and a divine interpretation behind it, with the degenerate one being wrong of course. (Think of Mohammad's "I have my religion, you have yours", or think of Jesus' "love your enemies", or even the phrase "Jedem das seine" itself, and so on.) It seems like everything has this inherent capability to be corrupted. Although, this is one duality where I don't think there's any trinitarian reconciliation inside it, since there's really no way you could reconcile this divine interpretation with the degenerate interpretation, since that would be like reconciling Pure Truth (which comes from the Golden Age) and pure falsehood (which lies at the bottom of the Iron* Age) together, which I don't think is possible. But then again, this also reminds me of that one part from the Sermon on the Mount: "God raiseth his Sun upon both the good and the evil, and sendeth His rain upon both the just and the unjust." So… maybe there's more behind this duality? I hope not, but I'm not too sure. What say you?

<p>
	I find it interesting that he focuses so much on rationality. If he's a pagan (or whatever), he should be aware of how weak these /r/atheism-tier arguments are. The way I've always thought about it: reason is above emotion, but it is below spirit. Reason can tell you what's real, but it can never tell you what's true (as you mention). Only the soul can even attempt to experience that, but I guess Varulv probably doesn't even believe in the soul either.
</p>

<p>
	You know, inequality of the soul is probably one of the most central truths of fascism: that people are not only unequal when it comes to race and sex and all those materialistic things, but (most importantly) people's souls are not equal. Someone like Hitler would have the souls of maybe a 100 million people contained inside one body, whereas the average Westerner today probably has 1/10th the soul of the average Medieval Christian, who themselves probably had 1/10 the soul of the average ancient Aryan. It is really this inequality of the soul that leads us to experience God. And by the way, this is also yet another reason why democracy is bullshit (because the highest souls of any people need to be in charge of that people, not because of their rationality but because of their spiritual nobility). I don't know why Varulv is trying to argue against these things, since they're simply too central to fascism, but he's really got himself into an intractable rabbit hole over there.
</p>

<p>
	Nice debate though, lol.

	Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. This is the one area where I can't agree. I mean, there is of course only one Truth. And since we are both seekers of Truth, at the end we will reach the same peak (the same Truth), but this is one topic where I believe you're wrong (even though you're more well-read on it than me so far). The thing is, if you're at the top of the mountain, you would already know of everything that's below you, and you would also know of the experiences that led you to that top. What you're saying here is like saying that we (us fascists) can just fly to the top while the plebs walk up there. But I'd say: we're the ones actually climbing to the top, while the plebs don't even bother or care about doing so in the first place. Isn't that what's happening here? Or perhaps I misunderstood what you wrote?
</p>

<p>
	Hmm. I'll continue this line of thought a bit further down, since it bleeds into the next few topics too…

	Yeah, the issue of intuition appears in so many different areas of life. It appears in the music of Mozart (which apparently just came to him perfectly finished, as if he just received it from God, in many instances), it appears in Tesla's writings as you mentioned, and I've also seen Alexis Carrel (the French doctor who sympathized with Germany) talking about it too. And actually, I guess this also relates to the above-mentioned need for knowing everything to reach Truth, or just reaching it outright. Hmm, I don't know. Could this be another duality that is resolved into a trinity? I think that might be the actual answer here.
</p>

<p>
	This also reminds me of something I read about regarding Hitler: about how the way he came into power was really quite unnatural, historically speaking. In two decades, a "bohemian artist" somehow became the most powerful man in the world and possibly the most influential person in all of human history. It's like Hitler was racing against time (no pun intended), and then he just reached the top while others were slugging along. Of course, we now know that Hitler was an expression of God's will, and so that's why he was able to do what no one else could. But "objectively speaking" (i.e. outside the confines of esoteric Hitlerism), we can see how "unnatural" this manifestation truly was. It reminds me of what we talked about earlier about "gaps in reality": Hitler himself, as a manifestation of God's will, was a "gap in reality." So, in a sense, perhaps Hitler did "fly to the top." But at the same time, he also couldn't have done that without the hardship and struggle he endured everyday. Again, I'm really starting to think that this is another paradox that just needs trinitarian reconciliation.
</p>

<p>
	And by the way, in this trinitarian duality, would intuition be solar or lunar? Between intuition vs hard work, which would be solar and which would be lunar? Personally, I think intuition is solar (similar to the Left-Hand Path, which I believe is easier but more dangerous), whereas hard work is lunar (similar to the Right-Hand Path, which I think is harder but less dangerous), and then when they're joined together Truth is reached. What do you think?

<p>
	Oh my God, I think I just had a spiritual semi-epiphany just from reading that passage and its accompanying calculations. Holy shit, this is exactly the type of knowledge I came to IronMarch for! While reading, I even had a thought like, "Man, do I even deserve to know these truths?" Lol, I don't know why I thought that, but yeah, you're making really powerful points here. It's like my field of vision just opened up and expanded by a million degrees.
</p>

<p>
	Holy shit… so it goes that far? It goes that far? Man, my perspective has been so small thus far. Now I can't imagine how ridiculous I must have sounded when I talked about returning to the actual Golden-Golden Age. Lol, so we're way past that point by now. But then, at the same, as you pointed out with the video of the fractals, in reality each and every smallest second also contains the greatest Golden Ages within itself. It really is true: "As above so below, as within so without."
</p>

<p>
	I totally lol'd at Stalin dying in 1953. Inb4 Vaszista the Hungarian Divinator starts unraveling the entire past and future on IronMarch.
</p>

<p>
	But no, really… so now, what hope do we have when it comes to the outside world? Doesn't this mean that basically every fascist is in essence a Man Against Time? Even if you are Above it, you're still Against it because at least you're not In it. Really, the outside world has no hope at all. I suppose this is why people like Jesus and Gautama went the way they did, since they too realized this exact same fact. But someone like Hitler would say: "Well, you can't turn the masses into fascists, but you can at least turn them into pro-fascists." And actually, considering the utter degeneracy of the modern world, perhaps we can't even turn them into pro-fascists anymore either. Perhaps all we can do is to turn them into pro-pro-fascists, since that's as far as they could ever see.
</p>

<p>
	It's interesting, also, when I consider that the average Kurd isn't as degenerate as the average Westerner. We've already begun a small propaganda campaign, and I've found that it's much easier to convince the average Kurd to become a National Socialist than it would ever be to convince the average Westerner. Now, of course, the average Kurd wouldn't understand the true essence of National Socialism at all. But I've found that he would still understand what type of world NS entails on the surface, and he'd still be much more receptive to it. I tell some average Kurd "We are racist nationalists and we will exterminate all those Arabs and Turks and Persians" and he's like "wonderful, where do I sign up?" Lol, not once has anyone accused us of "xenophobia" or "racism" or "intolerance" or anything. I guess that's the upside of still living inside the struggle, instead of you guys where you have much easier lives. The average person here gives much less of a shit about humanity.
</p>

<p>
	But yeah, now I understand that when it comes to us fascists ourselves, the outside world is just completely irrelevant anyway. All that matters is our path toward God, and we ultimately reach that same conclusion you mentioned: embodying the Golden Age within ourselves, and that is the Philosopher's Stone/Holy Grail/etc, with which we can indeed turn everything into gold. By embodying the Golden Age within ourselves, we permeate its Truth outside of ourselves. Yeah, I see.
</p>

<p>
	By the way, this just reminded me of something: what do you think about the various esoteric ideas about the ancient Aryans having the abilities of flight and telekinesis and living for thousands of years and all that stuff? How much worth do these theories have from your perspective?

<p>
	Isn't this what the whole issue of Men Above Time boils down to? I imagine that a monastic type of order, led by the likes of Evola, would be the perfect thing that fascism needs but so far lacks. I don't think it would be the only component of such an Organic State, but rather a part of it, interweaved with the other parts just like the SS and the Wehrmacht and everything else that was interweaved within the larger structure of Nazi Germany.
</p>

<p>
	But yeah, we are in total agreement here, especially regarding the issue of Holy Monarchy. I was just exploring the conception of governments being in a dichotomous relationship that is sort-of against God. At the end, this is actually just the old issue of church vs state, which shouldn't exist anyway because the church and state would be one and the same in an Organic Society.

<p>
	That is my dream too, man. And we're actually planning to build such places in Kurdistan. Our mountains and forests are filled with areas that could provide that mystical and magical environment in which Kurdish nationalists could train and strengthen our souls and reach God and all that good stuff. Luckily for us, most Kurdish groups don't give two shits about values or morals, and so as long as we bribe the right people no one is going to bother us. This is another area where we will have it easier than you guys, since any attempt Europeans could make at such a project would be met with a ton of hostility. The first esoteric temple dedicated to Hitler will be built in Kurdistan, I can assure you of that. ;)
</p>

<p>
	God, it will truly be so amazing when we realize these dreams. Esoteric fascist initiation centers in Kurdistan… a man can dream.

	Yup, I'd say this once again returns to the issue of spiritual inequality. People don't have equal souls, and so in this age of spiritual anarchy where (as you mention) the Brahmin caste doesn't exist anymore, the new clergy has become scientists. And not even good scientists who understand the limits of rationality and realize that they need to go beyond logic (e.g. similar to Newton and his research into alchemy), but rather we just have the most materialistic and spiritually blind people shaping the average person's mind in this modern world. The idea of "why" has been completely removed from the human mind following the loss of WWII. (And then hilariously enough, these same modernists "teach" kids about "critical thinking skills," lol. Yeah, right.)

<p>
	I'd say, it would only be possible if there was really an urgent and fanatical need to do so, and you also have to do it in a unified front against some sort of common enemy. Interestingly enough, I remember that Kurdish had a much easier time with incorporating rarely used Kurdish words (with the purpose of removing the more often used Arabic words) than did Turkish or Persian, because of our urgent need to do so. From WWI onward, the general Kurdish culture has gravitated toward massively returning to Kurdish words (regardless of how rare they are) and using them as much as possible, while forgetting and throwing away words with non-Kurdish or non-Iranian origins (regardless of how common they are). That's why today, the younger Kurdish generations speak a much purer Kurdish than the previous generations do.
</p>

<p>
	What's fascinating is that the Turks and Persians tried to do the same thing, but they didn't succeed to the extent that we did. They also tried to purify Persian and Turkish of Arabic words, but they were much less urgent and much less fanatical about it, so the years went by and they became complacent.
</p>

<p>
	Again, I'd say it all boils down to how urgent and fanatical you are about it, since this is literally a race against time in which the prize is the next generation's mother-tongue.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Regarding Iran… here's my answer: maybe yes, but only if it's led by Kurds. :D
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, the modern "Iran" isn't even Iran; a better name for it would be "Persiastan." That's basically what it is. Us Kurds refuse to live under Persians, since we consider ourselves to be superior to them (we consider them to be degenerate faggots). Of course, naturally the Persians also consider themselves to be superior to us (they consider us to be uncivilized barbarians) and so they wouldn't accept living under us either. But the truth is that they're the inferior ones, because their blood is too tainted by Mongols, their language is too tainted by Arabic, and their spirituality is too tainted by Semitic influences. Kurds maintain the true and solar Iranian spirit to a much higher degree. So, I'd say that if a country existed by the name of "Iran" but spoke Kurdish and had Kurds at its top, I would <em>reluctantly</em> support it (since the best thing would still just be a 100% Kurdish Kurdistan with nothing else in it). But regardless of that, the fact is that the current "Iran" speaks Persian and has Persians at the top, so there's really no reason for an inferior people (Persians) to rule over us. Do you see what I mean?
</p>

<p>
	Regarding the alliances thing… well, all alliances are ultimately temporary. No two nations can have a permanent alliance. It's bound to end sooner or later at some point. And, as far as the Persians are concerned… yeah, I've always thought the best thing Kurdistan would be to have a temporary alliance with the Azeris and Balochis and other ethnic groups there against the Persians. At first this would make Iran collapse, but in the end if the territory ends in Kurdish hands that would be good. The Persians really need a nice beating. There's no getting around that, my friend. If Kurds gather up the other ethnicities and whip up a massive civil war in Iran, that would be perfect. Did you know that Persians are barely 60% of Iran's population? And that percentage keeps going down. Their hold on power is really shaky, so it wouldn't be very difficult for us to topple the beast down, especially in a few years from now. 
</p>

<p>
	The Turks present a much bigger challenge though, which is why I mentioned the Balkan guys. But again, even that would just be a temporary alliance, and we would ultimately have to fight against the Turks on our own.
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, you're thinking of this from a European perspective. But that doesn't apply here, because the Kurds are in a very unique situation: the Northern half of Kurdistan fights against Turkey and listens to Iran (and subsequently to Russia and the rest of its bloc) while the Southern half fights against Iran and listens to Turkey (and subsequently the US and the rest of its bloc). It's very similar to the South/North Korea issue, where the whole division of global geopolitics is demarcated exactly halfway through the actual nation, and subsequently it cuts the nation in half right there. Do you see the problem? The Kurdish saying has always been true: "No friends but the mountains."
</p>

<p>
	But yeah, I agree with the rest of what you say, especially regarding the multi-disciplined approach.

	Fascinating information. Thank you for sharing. Now I see where you come from (spiritually speaking). But this should also clue us in as to how our wildly different national aspirations and goals play a great role in the divergence of our geopolitical ideals (similar to that one image of the kid pointing at the circle that shows how Truth is surrounded by the different national conditions and contemporary cultures and so on). Your perspective is from that of a nation that lived with and ruled a multi-national kingdom, whereas mine is from that of a nation that didn't live with other nations but was instead ruled by them. Again, as you mentioned, a Polish person would probably see what Kurdistan's problem is, since they too have had that same problem of being split apart from side to side. And meanwhile, the Poles also have their motley crew of small nations they could ally with (i.e. the Intermarium, which is similar to our thing with the Balochis and Azeris), but in the end they're all on their own. Kurdistan is also just one giant paradox, and I'm certain that any Kurdish nationalist movement would have to be utterly fanatical to its core, with no conception of coexistence with any foreigners existing anywhere within its worldview. That is very different from your perspective as a Hungarian, which ruled a multi-national empire for a long time and was in a more secured position for much of its history.

	Again, nothing is wrong with any of this, but it serves to show how wildly different our application of fascism would inevitably be in our respective lands.

	Again, I feel totally guilty for not checking these links out yet, but I will very soon.

	But yeah, I think he's a really suspicious dude too. From what I know about him so far, one thing that I've already noticed is this: from the way he talks, it looks like he considers himself some sort of prophet that heralds a new political belief that does away with liberalism and communism and fascism (lol, as if the word "fascism" belongs in that sentence). But at the same time, as you mention, he doesn't look trustworthy at all, which would be absolutely necessary for someone who tries to do such a thing. You can't construct a "fourth political theory" like this, no matter how true the theory is. Look at Hitler screaming his lungs out and bleeding his heart out on the stage for the sake of spreading Truth. And compare that to Dugin, who is just giving a normal speech, yet also making it seem likely this is a revelatory speech about some truth no one has reached yet. Like you said, makes you wonder what's really on his mind. (Personally, my conclusion so far has been that he's really just a Putin lackey. I haven't seen any evidence to the contrary yet.)

	Lol, I love the little dance he does at the beginning. His face alone is a prime argument against democracy. Belongs in the degenerate face thread.

	That's pretty good. I'm trying to do the same thing, although I do it in the early morning instead of late at night. The mind is clearer then. :D
