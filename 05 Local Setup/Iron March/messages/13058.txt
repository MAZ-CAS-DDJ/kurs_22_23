	Either someone in that thread is from IM, or they took content from one of the IM Aussie regulars. You already posted in the Aussie thread regarding a meetup. Might as well give it the weekend to see if you get any more bites, and we can take it from there. Weekend or week day would work alright, so long as it's after work hours.

	What sort of meetup? I dunno, I'm not all that big on organizing or meeting people from the internet usually, but common sense would say meeting up somewhere public in the CBD and heading off to some place local to chat. Date will have to depend on schedules.
