	Oh, I like Vona, but Codreanu is a whole diffferent level. The Capitain was a Saint, really. If the Church will arise from its ashes once again, he will be declared as a saint, since he has 'The Red Crown of Martyrdom'. Gábor Vona is a politician, but I am happy that. He is in his place, we would need more men like him. Also his views on Islam are much more positive than of any other nationalist movements in Europe.
