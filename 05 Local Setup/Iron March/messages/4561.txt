<p>Hey man, your posts about Christianity are some good shit. Definitely challenging and encouraging, especially when it's considered cool among some nationalist/fasc/3rdPos scenes to dismiss Christianity as being a timid pussy faith.</p>
<p>This did get me thinking though; you seem like a man who's also into Game and sex and all that. While I'm no bar-hopping pickup artist myself, I do like sex, and I'm not married, but I'm also kind of rediscovering my faith, you could say. Basically my question to you is, what's your understanding of how a man's basic need to fuck and play the game in the modern world fits in with the basic 'No sex outside of marriage' teaching just about any church sticks to? </p>
<p>Reason I'm discussing this in a PM is because it didn't strike me as needing a thread of its own, but if you think it'd be relevant for the forum at large to deserve a thread, I'll certainly follow up there.</p>
