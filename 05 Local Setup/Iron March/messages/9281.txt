<p>I get that, there's warning. Time for things to be said, affairs to be put in order.</p>
<p>But then the impending  inevitabilty of that dreaded moment in time that you know is certain even though it hasn't occured yet. it's as sure as tommorrow, even if there's more time than that, and it hangs over your head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She died in a Car Crash, im still not sure of the details because I get different stories.</p>
<p>One thing i heard is that she took some sleeping pills and they kicked in before she got home, also that she was driving drunk or a mix of both. Something stupid. It all happend in a Day but she didn't die instantly, though she did die that night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I didn't tell her i loved her or goodbye the last time i saw her, and i remmeber times I said i wished she was dead (y'now stupid shit kids say and don't understand). Fucking Stupid.</p>
