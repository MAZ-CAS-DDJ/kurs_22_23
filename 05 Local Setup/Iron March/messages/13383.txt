	Oh, I was actually talking about that Slavic guy's (Sorry, don't have a Cyrillic keyboard)  signature above my comment. The one that claims to quote me. Like I said though I was just playing along and I really don't give a shit about the signature either way. So<em> I am</em> good huh? Also, considering some of the other shit Oakleaf has done and the fact that he is still here, probably means that he isn't going anywhere.
