<p>Edinboro University, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>It's primarily a liberal arts school. I knew it had big art programs but I was unaware of its primary purpose when my sister invited me because it's "local and a great school".<br /><br />When my mother was here, there was a young conservatives group on campus. Now there's nothing in way of right-wing group or club on campus and there's plenty of left-wing shit, the former of which I'm trying to get started in direct conjunction with my IronMarch chapter. We'd be the "Young Far Right" club.</p>
