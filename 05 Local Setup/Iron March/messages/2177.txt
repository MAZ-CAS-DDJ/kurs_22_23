<p>When we make some final ajustments to it in September I will most likely spread it around to get additional input</p>
<p>On the subject of Etat, he is a good lad who's going places however he's very young (which is odd considering im a year older than him). He's inexperienced, untested, insecure of himself, second guesses himself, is lacking in confidence, he needs a firmer head on his shoulders. (This is coming from the conversations I've had with him)</p>
<p>As for my experience so far I've come award with mostly positives, I've found however that when members oppose each other that they often attempt to rip at each others throat to prove their "Alpha Male Fascist Superiority". When in reality it appears as if they're trying way too hard and grasping at straws.</p>
<p>I'd say roughly 90% Good Men and Woman (Iron March is a bit of a sausage fest however, how many women are there actually on here?)</p>
<p>And about 10% Cocks.</p>
