<p>This is too true, sadly. I wonder why we all don't simply ally with each other, take measures towards a self-sufficient economy, surround our Eastern and Western borders with barbed wire, machine guns and minefields and acquire tactical nukes (just in case). At the end of the day, we have no one to blame but ourselves for the situation we are still in. Instead of deepening ties with our neighbours we all seem to be looking for some "big brother"-country, be it Russia or the US/EU.</p>
