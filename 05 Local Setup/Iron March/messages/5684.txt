<p>I don't know why I kept in memory a humoristic column in the International Herald Tribune of many years back where a guy, after the success of the horror movie Jaws, was suggesting catchy titles for new horror movies giving also suggestions for the subject. After Paws, Claws and the like he suggested Laws, where unsuspecting citizens were falling prey to insidious laws. At that time I was thinking how stupid that was but today it happens in the European Union where people have their hands tied by EU directives, decisions of the Human Rights Court, supervision from various comissaries appointed god knows how and the like. Just remember when Joerg Haider was only a minor partner in the government in Austria what pressure was coming from Brussels. I am sure, for exemple, if Marine LePen would be elected president her decisions would be contested at various EU institutions, directives would be issued, French bonds dumped in big quantities in the market and more. Houdini in person could not untangle himself from these "chains". Historically every passage to a new order was violent; the peoples are like paralysed by the crisis - I like the motto of Racist "N-S - Der Organisierte Wille der Nation"; some sort of wake up call is necessary.</p>

What I ment about the financial instruments was that the big capital through lobbying obtained deregulations allowing them to speculate more and make more money. I am sure you know that it was proved in court even that certain banks and investment firms kept recommending their clients to buy various financial products even after they were circulating internal memos about the high degree of risk of the same.</p>
