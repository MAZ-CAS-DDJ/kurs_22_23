	Yes, I think different kind of alliances can and should work together; we only have to acknowledge their historical realities. For example, nobody can deny that Czechs, Moravians and Slovaks (I'm not sure about Ruthenians) are having a bond between them, but the same way nobody can deny that Hungary, Slovakia, Transylvania etc. has a similar connection either; whether it be geographical, biological, historical, cultural, spiritual etc. These are already there, we only have to figure out how to use them in order to achieve an organic unity rather then cherry-pick some of them and turn it against each other. For that we would need a total Fascist Revolution first though. :D

	So did Czechoslovakia try to "Czechianize" Slovakia or was the Czechoslovakian identity more like somewhere between the two? Also, if Slovakian is just a dialect of Czechoslovakian than this applies to Czechian as well isn't it? I heard from a few Hungarian guys from Slovakia that the Eastern territories are still in a very bad shape, mainly because of the Gypsy infestation - same thing applies to Eastern Hungary unfortunately.

	What was the official standpoint on Carpathian Ruthenia in the second Czechoslovakian state?
