<p>This is true but I recall the Irish section of stormfront being fairly active with several users, so there must be some stomach for it.  A couple of google searches mentioning "Irish" "Ireland" "Fascist" will pop this page up on the first page of results.  Getting certain keywords linking to this particular forum and specifically the Irish section could draw a fair bit of attention to it, some positive, some destructive, some downright hostile, but publicity breathes publicity.</p>
