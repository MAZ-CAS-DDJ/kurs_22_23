	Been very busy IRL.

<p>
	The pie charts were in the original long document I sent you. I’ve just put them together into something more resembling an infographic.
</p>

<p>
	Here’s an updated version with additional text for added credibility:
</p>

<p>
	<span><span style="font-size:9pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333;background:#FFFFFF;"><a href="https://mega.nz/#!vR5DVSZR" rel="external nofollow">https://mega.nz/#!vR5DVSZR</a></span></span><span><span style="font-size:9pt;font-family:Arial;color:#D90007;background:#FFFFFF;"><span style="word-spacing:0px;">!6tpnBAQXFg2OFGg7UcYE8yk2_OOMVAL3SxGYfgVFEqI</span></span></span>
</p>

<p>
	I’m thinking we could put up the original long colour-coordinated document as an article of Noose as a permanent feature. And then have people spread the infographic around the net with a link on it to the longer version.
