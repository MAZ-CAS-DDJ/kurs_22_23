	Sława ci, Bóg z nami. And also I do have some general questions off the bat.
</p>

<p>
	1. How strong is the Orthodox faith in Romania? Poland is <strong>extremely </strong>Catholic, to the point where if you identify as any other religion, you are ridiculed or laughed at. Is this comparable to Romanian Orthodoxy? I once met this "Polish Pagan" on the internet who confessed that he refused to participate in his Catholic confirmation, and was tied to a tree by his classmates and beaten (haha). Polish faith in God is very strong. Paganism is surreal.

	2. How come Romanians don't write in Cyrillic script?
</p>

<p>
	3. What is the average income and how is the current economic situation? Most ex-Warsaw Pact countries are still struggling even today.
