<p>Writing about arse kissing in here and the NBU, I read that you skimmed the "National Action" PDF. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Having read it, I am left with:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- the same question you posed regarding structure and lack of interest in contesting and winning elections.  I, for one, do not think that the PDF answers this question;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- the economic model in the PDF is flawed. "A" in the model represents the weekly wage and claimed to be all the money in the real economy.  Yet the "weekly wage" is never all the money in the real economy under current economic structures. I agree that current system is near breaking point but the basis they use is wrong;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- marketing the message for all in the 21st C does need an overhaul, there I sincerely agree and the examples used, especially the negative ones of the UKIP and BNP, are good ones.  In fact I squirmed a bit at 3 on the NBU site on Friday 11th - one which was taken down regarding the Afghan teenage school girl shot in the head by the Taliban and flown to the UK for surgery and recovery - which just strike me as trite and amateurish and, I think, shared from the EDL and another party.  To my mind, while building a party, one deals in straight-forward, positive, messages as to what the party strives for and not what others do: by putting up a comparison, you are only asking to be compared and diminishing your message.  The party messages out of Germany and Italy of the 1930s looked at what they were about, doing and did.  Only once you have started winning elections can comparison be allowed;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- "Practice 01:" I note no ref to the NBU (or BU) in "Failed Groups".  "Factors to Consider - Target audience"...there, I strongly agree;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- "Organization 01 and 02": Sound more akin to a cry to the lads for a bit of fun after a lager-fueled Friday night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over-all, I am left with asking why Goyles et al aren't rolling up their sleeves and contributing their faith and assets, such as marketing &amp; technical know how, to the NBU?  Now, if we can answer that as members of the NBU, we are taking a rewarding step-forward for fascism in the UK.</p>
