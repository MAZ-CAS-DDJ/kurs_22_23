<p>Well, I am rather interested in history. I've heard Kursat mentioned on other forums by Turks. He is known to the Chinese as one of the nobles of the Ashina clan who rebelled against the Emperor Taizong. Taizong adopted Turkic steppe warfare tactics, recruited Turks into his army and appointed them as generals (a fact lamented in the Orkhon inscriptions), expanded into Central Asia, and took the title 'Khagan', and even held Kurultais. Taizong's son Li Chengqian (who was eventually exiled for attempting to overthrow his father) liked living like a Turk:</p>

<p>"He [Chengqian] loved to emulate Turkish speech and their manner of dress. He chose from among his retinue those who had Turkish features and grouped them in bands of five; he made them plait their hair, wear sheepskins, and herd sheep. He had made five wolf's head banners and tents and set up yurts. The crown prince took up residence here; he gathered sheep and cooked them, and then, drawing out his waist-knife, he would carve the meat and let everyone eat."</p>

<p>The flirtation between the Tang Chinese and the Turks seems to have ended after the Talas River battle with the Abbasids, and the ensuing rebellion lead by the Turkic general An Lushan.</p>

<p>Perhaps you know about the 3rd of May, which we Turkish nationalists celebrate as "Türkçülük günü", or "Turkism day", which was all about a response from the Turkish youth to an unfair accusation and trials that related to him and his friends.</p>
<p>Aside from being uncompromising, he knew the meaning of sacrifice, and he spoke of it as the highest of virtues.</p>

<p>I know of it, I read about Atsız in a document titled <em>Racism in Turkey: The Case of Huseyin Nihal Atsiz</em>, which is obviously not the most neutral source, but there are few available in english about this remarkable nationalist. Apparently Atsız wrote a letter denouncing Communists, and was then subjected to a politically motivated trial after accusations from Sabahattin Ali.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It seems that influential members of the Turkish government during that time did not like the Turanist idea (which they denounced as adventurism). I think this may be due to Enver Pasha's failures (for all these failures, at least he died like a man) souring them to the idea of forming links with Central Asian Turks, and then there was also Soviet pressure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've also heard about how Atsız was tried in 1973 for denouncing certain MPs as 'Kurdists' (if he could see the state of Turkish politics today, surely he'd turn in his grave).</p>

<p>As for Armenians, I think that they are if anything, untrustworthy. As for being well-received in Europe, even Kurds are well-received in Europe, but not us. Not that I really care, but the fact that the supposedly "liberal" Europe chooses its friends via Indo-European based bias is beyond me.</p>
<p>I don't think it carries a religious undertone, I think its just the typical liberal approach to any minorities that claim to have been persecuted, as long as they are not Turks, of course <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>Armenians are despised America wherever they may be found in abundance and all races dislike them. Their most recent notable achievement here was the biggest healthcare fraud in US history, to the tune of $163 million. The Office of Inspector General's list of most wanted criminals reads like the guest list of an Armenian wedding. Surely there are good people among them, but they seem to have a culture of corruption which they have carried with them from Armenia. Every April, they moan about their 'genocide' and how they were innocent victims. While Armenians complain about how other ethnic groups are supposedly racist for not liking them, yet they consider all Non-Armenians as inferior 'Odars'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for the Kurds, it is true that many Americans (and especially Neocons) have an idealized image of them as progressive, freedom loving tribesman. I don't know much about them, but I doubt that they're as saintly as Western liberals make them out to be.</p>
