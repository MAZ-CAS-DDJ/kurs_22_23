<p>No problem at all, I take care of our people (fascist minded men and women). I find it valuable that a girl has such views and that you developed them by your own. Fascist girls in the scene I met came into that through their boyfriends or brothers or were just plain weird or whores. I can't say I've ever met a fascist woman in real life who'd have some sound reasoning behind her worldview.</p>

<p>I'm also in contact with a lot of girls of your age because I work as receptionist in "youth home" (for high school students who live outside our city but attend school here; don't know the English word for that sort of institution) and you seem a lot more mature and opinionated. Most of them don't know shit about anything and have no clue about how the world works.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That's why I respect you and I hope that you'll continue to be like you are, no matter what. Just like people from my crew and other genuine fascists respect me and I don't care about what anyone else thinks about me. That's the whole point of "Aryan" ideal to me.</p>
