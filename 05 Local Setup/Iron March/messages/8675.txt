<p>Basically I'm starting a youtube channel where I'm going to be uploading my collection of NSBM, slavonic folk music and other stuff. Going to call it <em>cult of veles</em>, and I'd like some cover-art-whatever for the channel. It lists 2560 x 1440 as a reccomended size. I think just black w/ white on it would be best. (you know, le dark BM look) Probably include the name, not sure what else though. It's going to be mostly fascist music so you're free to make it as edgy as you like. Swastikas and sunwheels are okay.</p>

<p>Thanks? Your work is cool. Best looking thing I've ever made is my signature.</p>
