<p>Yeah, not saying you should play games all day obviously but you can do something ''better'', like starting up a small company, write a book or go out on the streets and cause some triggering. I mean, the current system is shit. We can both agree on that, so if you can get by without paying taxes to it and still have an OK income, why waste 8-10h a day on a work if you don't even enjoy it? I don't think anyone likes being a 'parasite', but right now society IS a huge parasite in the way. A huge machine making everyone into itself.</p>
