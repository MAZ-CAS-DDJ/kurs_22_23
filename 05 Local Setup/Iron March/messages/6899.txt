<p>G.Dawn is on the rise, having sphered plenty of right-wingers and even previous communists due to its work on the streets.</p>
<p>SYRIZA (liberals and immigrant lovers) are also on the rise but mostly due to reaction votes. People are sick of the old political parties that lead us here and they vote SYRIZA (same goes for G.Dawn)</p>
<p>And then there are the pro-Europe parties who have been leading us till now and wish to follow the road we are in now.</p>
<p>The rest are pretty much dying slowly.Â </p>
