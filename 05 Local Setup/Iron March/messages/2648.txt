According to litterature I have been reading about the industry revolution of Europe, technocratic ideas started to appear, both in industry matters and govermental matters. A system based upon competence, I see the benefit in economic dynamics for the greater good. </p>
<p>No. I was not educated by the standards of Rudolf Steiner. Of course, European education is heavily influenced by humanitarian ideas, unfortunately.</p>
