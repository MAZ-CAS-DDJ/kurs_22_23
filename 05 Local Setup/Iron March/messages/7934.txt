<p>Personally, I basically built my worldview through real life experience, I started off as some extremist kid 10 years ago and I always followed my passion and personal experience when adding opinions to this "fascist" worldview, but essentialy my loyalty was always the same. Our basic worldview is really simple, all those dissagreements are irrelevant, it's a shame that some people here have this marxist-intellectualist mentality where their worldview has to have a concrete answer to everything and whoever dissagrees with it even slightly is some sort of enemy. Here we just call everyone who's on our side "right wing" (as in "far right") and that's it. No need to complicate things. I post a lot of unorthodox opinions here but that's to get people to start thinking and questioning things, essentialy there's not much to write about fascism from purely theoretical point of view, it's just something you live in real life and you build opinions as life moves on.</p>

<p>As far as women are concerned the problem with many people is that they have low self esteem and settle for everything just so they'll have girlfriends. It's ok if you bang some skank when you're drunk but otherwise the higher you aim the better you'll get, just like with everything in life. I never really liked this modern dating culture, IMO this is for faggots, it's either one night stand or marriage, everything else in between is just a joke and you have to realize it. It's fine if you date some really cool girl but the way some people are crazy about their girlfriends these days is just insane. Even marriage shouldn't be out of love but out of personal interests anyway. Let's face it most women aren't worth much of attention other than sex, the good thing about our scene is that you have a lot of women around who're willing to get laid but don't want a serious relationship whatever that should mean anyway. To be honest I have quite a low opinion of women in general, but the whores who aren't ashamed of what they're doing usually have a cool down to earth character, especially those who hang around ultras/hooligans/fascists. The worst type of women are those who think they're something special and you see a lot of them these days, it's probably some product of retarded liberal individualism too.</p>

<p>Cool crew from Bratislava. This is the kind of image every fascist group should have, who cares what antifascists say when you look as badass as this, every kid who's not a faggot will want to join you. Look at the number of views and likes in the video too, the scene is getting more and more popular in eastern Europe. I understand quite a lot of Slovak because it's similar to Slovenian, put the text in google translate it has really cool lyrics..</p>
