	I recently got stationed in NC and was interested in knowing if there was a chapter here. Also, once IÂ saw MD was getting involved I had to look into the group more. Being moved here to the south has uprooted me from the groups I was previously involved in, so I'm Iron March to try and find some new groups. Thanks for your time, -Ulf.
