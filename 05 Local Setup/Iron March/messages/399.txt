<p>My favorite Strasser quotes are (from both Gregor and Otto): </p>
<p>"From the right we shall take nationalism, which has so disastrously allied itself with capitalism, and from the left we shall take socialism, which has made such an unhappy union with internationalism. Thus we shall form the National Socialism which will be the motive force of a new Germany and a new Europe" - Gregor </p>
<p>"We are socialists, we are enemies of today's capitalistic economic system for the exploitation of the economically weak, with its unfair salaries, with its unjust evaluation of a human being according to wealth and property instead of responsibility and performance, and we are determined to destroy this system under all conditions!" - Gregor </p>
<p>"Hate must be born of love. One must be capable of loving to know what is hateful, and so have the strength to destroy it" - Otto</p>
<p>"We have to learn that work is more than possession, that achievement is more than dividends. The most deplorable legacy of the capitalist economic system is that is has taught us to judge all things by standards of money, ownership, and possession. The decay of a people is a necessary outcome of applying such a standard of value, for for selection by ownership is the mortal foe of the race, of blood, and of life." - Otto </p>
<p>"In contradistinction to the hitherto prevailing liberal and mechanistic views, we start with the belief that a people or a nation is an organism, a living body, with definite peculiarities of a corporeal, mental, and spiritual kind" - Otto</p>
<p>"For the free and protestant German the service of the idea first and foremost is an ingrained necessity. The idea is divine in origin, while men are only its vehicles, the body in which the word is made flesh. The leader is made to serve the idea, and it is the idea alone that we owe absolute allegiance. The leader is human and it is human to error" - Otto</p>
<p>Hopefully that will do it for now. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
