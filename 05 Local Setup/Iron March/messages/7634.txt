<p>Did you already qualify? I was honestly pretty disappointed in it when I joined because the local chapter here is all middle-aged obese programmers, nobody I really relate to any more than the average population. I can leave that part out though, I think I got my point across. The social factor wasn't why I joined anyways though, I joined some years ago so I could go to a big conference they had in Atlanta, Georgia on meteorology. I don't know if the Canadian cards are the same, but you know how you can make that wobbly sound with laminated paper? You can do that with the American cards.</p>
