<p>Unfortunately, I cannot "Like" private messages.</p>
<p>But I like what you said. And the link of Prussian Socialism also.</p>
<p>I think we agree in our dislike of liberal Jews, and their use of the "Holocaust."</p>
<p>However, I cannot prevent but to feel some solidarity with Israel. When the liberals come to the side of Germany (when Preußen, Königsberg, "Ost-Brandenberg" etc were lost to Russia/Poland), then I will take the liberals seriously in their complaint of Israelis in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Although, Israelis should probably stop their militant measures though. They do not need the IDF to take the West Bank. The West Bank would become Israeli in 50 years the same way the Mediterranean coast became Israeli. From settlers moving east.</p>
<p>As for the confused Americans... I do not mind their German identity. But the truth is they are not German in soul or spirit, which is what matters as much as race. They are trying to find themselves, but are at heart American. Which is an odd thing, usually.</p>
<p>Obviously, I do not hate America or some of its culture, but it is a strange entity.</p>
