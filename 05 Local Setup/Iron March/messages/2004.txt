<p>I'm not a racialist merely based on the principle that I see Non-Wites taken out of their environment here in the States (especially Asians) are just as capable once they bow to authority and culture. Not to mention I'm partially Turkic. However I have no problem with Racialists and am content to agree to disagree on the point of race. As for Eugenics, yes I am very much in agreement on Eugenics and ould support a comprehensive program that would likely stamp out much of the scum. I also dont know if I necessarily consider myself Rational so much as Pragmatic, but either way!</p>
