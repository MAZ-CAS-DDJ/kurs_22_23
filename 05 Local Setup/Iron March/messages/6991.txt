<p>Hi, I posted a question to you in that Fascist Movies thread but you probably didn't see it. I'd like to know what you think about movie Football Factory (2004). You've probably seen it? Few weeks ago I watched it again because of nostalgia and I still like it</p>
<p>As I wrote in the thread:</p>
<p>"I always liked this movie, seems like a relatively realistic gritty depiction of modern English hooligan scene, plus the main protagonists are Chelsea Headhunters who are neo-Nazis. This movie inspired a whole generation of "casuals" here. That Billy Bright character is one of the best fascist characters ever, Frank Harper is a legend. He was like one of my childhood heroes lol</p>
<p>That's just my opinion though, I don't know how English hools viewed it, I mean do they think this movie is a "joke" or not?"</p>
