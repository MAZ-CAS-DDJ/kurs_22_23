<p>Well, if you are a Star Wars fan I would suggest Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2. Although, to be honest I like the second one better because when you go to the dark side people actually acknowledge it and you can get more powerful, though there are some canon issues. As for strategy games I am not for sure as it has been a long time since I have played one. I would have to think more about that one.Â </p>
