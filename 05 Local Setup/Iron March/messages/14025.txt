	You seem so uncorrupted by modernity is what I mean. Innocent like a child. The past doesn't matter too much, you can let go of it. I've made mistakes too, and it's not a big deal so long as you learn from those mistakes and improve yourself. There's no need to worry, hell probably half the people here come from lefty backgrounds. It's easy to fall into the trap of communism as an edgy teen as a rebellion against the current system, before you realise both are just as bad as each other.

	Don't just strive for intellectualism and philosophy. The best philosophy comes from someone experienced on the front lines. Train yourself so you can be the boots on the ground in times of action and a philosopher in times of inaction. The reason Jünger's writings are good is because he experienced the war first hand.
