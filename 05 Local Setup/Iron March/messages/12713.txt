That's certainly understandable. At least he had the comfort of knowing you weren't against him. Parents using their children to fight against the other, or at least brainwashing them to hate the other for no reason but their own resentment, is a hateful thing. Stay strong, and I really hope you have the real-life support you need during this time. I'm sure you do. The safety of your father's eternal soul is definitely the greatest of comforts. I'll pray for him and you and your family, if you don't mind.</p>

No problem! Thanks for the map, but from what it looks like, the nearest chapels are about 40 minutes away. I know there's some sort of church in a town I'm often in that does a Latin Mass, so that would work, even if they're technically still with Rome. I've been to one once, and it was quite the experience. There were lots of young people there, and so many mantillas! ... Unfortunately this was the U.S., where faith is a lot stronger. At my church back home, the confession queue was one person long at most. When I went to church in the U.S., there was a small hall absolutely filled with people waiting to confess.</p>
