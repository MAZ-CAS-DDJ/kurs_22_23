	I speak with my comrades. If you do not have a cz, is not problem<br />
	Other handgun is enough for me (caliber 9mm or 22 LR)
</p>

<p>
	I think the best is to make two trips. The first end of August. We will just take handguns for this time, <br />
	We do not know enough to pay you big sums of money 
</p>

<p>
	If everything goes well on the first trip I would return for a second trip in november with a bigger budget.
</p>

<p>
	I would take then assault rifle, ammunition and perhaps more depending on what you have
</p>

<p>
	<br />
	Budget first trip : Surroundings 2000€<br />
	Budget second trip : 8000€
</p>

<p>
	In your opinion, what is the best way to cross the border?
