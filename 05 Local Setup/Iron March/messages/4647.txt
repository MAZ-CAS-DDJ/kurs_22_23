<p><span style="font-size:14px;">I much enjoy Senator H</span>enry Clay because of his way of Compromising many decision and for his support of the American system, I enjoy the fact he was called "The Great Pacificator" The principles of America I have come to like are its love of patriotism, its Civil religion, its European Christian foundation are just a few of the things I love about it most.</p>
