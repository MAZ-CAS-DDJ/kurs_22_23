<p>Indeed. I believe Mexicans need to unite regardless of race, while at the same time respecting racially boundaries. I say that the best way to make it work is to have american born Mexicans lead the movement. Did you know that the CIA monitored the synarchist movement during World War Two for its pro-axis sentiments? They also idolize Jose antonio and franco. They have great points. You should also look into the mexicN nationalist front, they're good but they also have admiration of indigenous culture. I personally feel it's not worth valuing. Even though you're not mexican, you're still a white Hispanic. I would have no problem with inviting white Hispanics to join the cause. We all share Spanish blood. </p>
<p>Anyways, do you believe that a civil war is possible in Mexico? With the nationalists of combating the government and nacro terrorists? If so obtaining arms isn't an issue, it's organization and commitment that I believe is needed.</p>
