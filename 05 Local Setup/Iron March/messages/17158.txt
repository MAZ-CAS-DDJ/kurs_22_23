			Not exactly. Every new law have to be compatible with the previous Canon, thus with the former laws and regulation; with the Catholic Tradition. When somebody brakes this line of Legitimacy, the Church ceases to be Catholic until this will be fixed. It works like the confession: if the sinner honestly repents his sin, the confession will be valid, but if he is not honest, it won't, regardless of what the priest thinks/says/does. Let me quote the wiki article on the papal infallibility:

					Papal infallibility is a dogma of the Catholic Church that states that, in virtue of the promise of Jesus to Peter, the Pope is preserved from the possibility of error "when, in the exercise of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, he defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole Church."
				</p>

			The Catholic Church never claimed that the pope can't make mistakes; this blessing comes into force only IF the Church is intact, IF the pope is legitimate and IF he speaks ex cathedra (which was described in the quote). Sedevacantism states that the line of Legitimacy was cut with Vatican II, thus Vatican cannot be considered as Catholic anymore (think about Constantinople). They aren't even calling themselves 'Sedevacantists', but Catholics, as they are doing their best to be the guardians of the real Catholic Tradition. You have also mentioned a big dilemma, that of reforming. While it is true that we have to keep the teaching intact, we have to change its interpretation, for the very same thing will look completely different from another perspective, and our perspective is not the same as that of our ancestors - just think about the Bible and its translations. There are no choices, either we keep the essence unchanging while at the same time keep up with time or we will fail. It was exactly Orthodoxy which made me realize this with the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/201503260001hq.jpg" rel="external nofollow">blessing of a Soyuz space rocket</a>.

	So basically Catholic church doesn't exist expect in pockets of resistance against the Vatican?<br />
	Change interpretation? You mean so that turn the other cheeks means that somalis can rape my wife? Nah, holy book is taken literally.<br /><br />

			I just told to IronFalx that it was IronMarch which made me somewhat skeptic about this thing with Russia. :D I am still pro-Russian though, since even if that's also a corrupt system, it doesn't idealizes corruption at least. I hope you are right, but damn, take a look at Poland... a strong, religious and Nationalistic country, but totally against Russia. :'(

	I often take the views and stances of nationalist element of a particular nation as something that will define their future. In that, really, Polish nationalists and those leaning towards it are being friendly toward Germans and Russians alike. But thats just my hunch, we'll see.<br />

			I don't see Orthodoxy as a bad thing, but that's just not who we are. I see Catholicism and Orthodoxy both as defective religions, as two halves of something what was one before the Great Schism. Both are having their advantages and disadvantages: Catholicism changes too much, what makes it is an aggressive, dynamic force (see the Catholic colonial empires and today's mass conversions in Asia f.ex.). Orthodoxy changes too little, what makes it a defensive, static force (see how you were able to resist Islam for all those centuries). Same with their structures. It is much easier to control the Church with one leader, and he can do great things if he is good - but as soon as we got a bad leader everything falls to pieces. Although if you have multiple leaders the control of the Church becomes difficult, and though you are not threatened by the actions of a bad leader, this works vice versa - even if you have the greatest man on earth he won't be able to bring you to victory since he can't have the control over the entire Church.

		<p>
			What we need is the synthesis of the virtues of both Churches and thus a return to the original Church, which was Catholic and Orthodox (in the original sense of these words) at the same time.
		</p>

		<p>
			We don't have much of the Greek Catholics, the Poles are against Orthodoxy because "it's Russian", the Czechs are the greatest Atheists in Europe (the true face of Protestantism, right?) and God save us from Slovak Orthodoxy which would immediately become pan-Slavism.

<p>
	Orthodoxy not changing is not a flaw. Change breeds degeneracy such as protestantism. Catholics can be again in communion with other Christians onyl when their religious leaders or Pope himself accepts the canon of Orthodoxy. Catholic Church needs to become part of Orthodox Catholic Church again.<br />
	Pan-Slavism is good, only if we are talking about closer cooperation or alliance, enough with the union states.<br />

			That's the same fragmentation of power I was talking about above. I am sure that's somehow related to the Slavic spirit, to the Slavic sense of community, but I still have to look after that. To be honest with you the first thing what comes to mind when I read something like this is the Protestant masses with guitars and hippies. I know that's not how you do it, but being closer to the people has its risks.

	Each church has to preach the Thuth to their people in their own way, their own language. Jesus Christ is the head of the Church and he is the ultimate authority so there is no need for centralized power. Also it can not work. Why would a Russian be responsible for Greeks or Romanians? He can't speak their language nor understand their nature. Junkies and hippies are preaching heresy and sin, so thats out of the question :D

			Yup, only you are referring lands as your which you obtained only in 1918. What do you want to have exactly? RS? Bosnia? Bosnia plus former RSK? Bosnia plus Croatia? How many years would pass after that until you would start talking about how the Slovenes are also Serbs in denial?

	Lands that were historically ours and populated by our people and are today populated by our folk just of different faith. Our country had foreigners as its subjects such as Greeks and Bulgarians and we don't want their lands, thats why you don't see nationalists dreaming about Serbian Empire anymore because Nation states are natural and we are not blessed to lead any form of empire. Lower Dalmatia, Slavonia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, Skoder, Vardar Macedonia - these are the territories that are at this moment outside of Serbia and under occupation. Serbia never laid claim on Croatia, ebcause we never had anything to do with it, only Slavonia and Dalmatia.
