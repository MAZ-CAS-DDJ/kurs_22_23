	The interview is just text based so I can send in the questions and he can answer at any time. What you guys should consider though is writing down the history, direction and goals of the group so we can rephrase it into a bit of text as an expose so as to avoid making it just an interview and providing a little something for the readers as a kind of intro to whom you are. Naked interviews are good for already known and established people or groups but if we're introducing you out there then it needs to have some background info.
