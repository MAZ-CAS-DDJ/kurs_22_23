	Alright. You can look into asmallorange hosting, which is what we used to use for IM. 100$ for a year, cheaper but they immediately shoah'd us soon as they received their first complaint letter to us. Again though, if your site will be entirely in lithuanian I don't imagine there will be that much of a problem.
