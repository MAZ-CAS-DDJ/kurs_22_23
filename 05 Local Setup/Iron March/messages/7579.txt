<p>Grandmother sent me some home grown apples, apples are good for heart I heard. There are girls in the fascist scene but I've yet to meet a normal one, then again most people I've met from the scene are a bit crazy, that's just how it is. Still, it's worth it because of those 10-20 people who are ok.</p>
