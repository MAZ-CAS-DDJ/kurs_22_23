	Gypsies came from somewhere in India so I'm not sure if you can say that Indians "stole" the definition of gypsy.

	The image that comes to my mind and often the one I see with my own eyes is this:

	The one in your picture has some similarities but that picture is kinda artistically made.

	Gypsies are a different race and they are subhuman scum. Generally they have a darker skin tone (though it can vary a lot) and different physiognomy that they can be recognized by. Around here they also have a certain manner of speaking that is an instant give-away. There's also the fact that they have an IQ between 60 and 80 which is easy to spot.

	They do have their own "culture" which mostly consists of stealing and scavenging for iron, complete with it's own subhuman music style called "manele". This "culture" is nothing less than an infectious disease that promotes degeneracy (not of the western fag cock-sucking kind but of the alcoholism, fornication and money-worshipping kind). There are indeed people who are racially Romanian but listen to gypsy music and adopt a gypsy-like attitude. They are usually called "cocalari", a word from the gypsy language used to refer to the lowest caste of gypsies (apparently they had something like that once).
