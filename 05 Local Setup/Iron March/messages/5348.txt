<p>Good day!</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin:0cm;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Well, I was communist-ish. I was still exploring my views but Communism seemed reasonable.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm .0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">At the same time, I had a soft spot for nationalism. Watching various vids on youtube about demographic</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm .0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">decline in Europe and other white nations, and being a European myself, this just didn't sit with me.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm .0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">There were aspects of communism that I didn't mind, but the main thing was the internationalism that I didn't like.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm .0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">They want all of the means of prod. to be owned collectively, but I don't think that could work on an</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm .0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">international scale.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm .0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm .0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Also at the same time, I had an intense dislike for Revleft-style leftism (a la 1960). So I searched up on google:</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm .0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">"revleft sucks", to see who shared my views on the revtards. It was mainly stromfront threads but then I came upon Ironmarch. After</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm .0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">I joined I read a little more about what Fascism was really about (though I still have a lot to read) and it just appealed to me more.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0cm 0cm .0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">It was anti-global capitalism and at the same time anti-internationalism and pro-nationalism. I felt it was perfect for me.</span></p>
