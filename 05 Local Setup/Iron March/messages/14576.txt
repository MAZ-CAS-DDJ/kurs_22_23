	Yeah we were supposed to release a number of manuals this year dealing with exactly this stuff, organization and activism, so far we only release the prelude to that, which concerns your own mental liberation before you can get into activism.  You can grab it here:

	Next thing to consider is how when you start from the bottom up the very first thing people will see is you personally, so they have to see that you are someone worth working with, following, building something with. I touched on that a bit in the Fascist Lifestyle topic, where I made a point of how a Fascist is just supposed to have a presence and thus influence wherever he goes:

	From what you said it actually sounds like you have a bit of a market to compete with for membership, what you want to do is really stand out on both message and presentation. Look at Skydas for example who really zeroed in on the whole retrowave aesthetics for themselves to make them stand out and turn heads, <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> does it to a lesser degree.

	Obviously focus on the fun aspect of it, nothing gets people to join better than if they feel like this isn't larp and it isn't some pretentious bullshit but a more open deal. It also depends to an extent if you're trying to start a proper movement or just an activism group/gang, for the latter you can use our Fascist Fraternity Chapters blueprint and have direct association with IM. I went over that <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/4730-fascist-alma-mater-and-im-chapters/" rel="">in this topic</a> and in <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qMmoQyS.png" rel="external nofollow">these</a> <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2QcOS2P.png" rel="external nofollow">infographics</a>.

	That's about it really. Decide first if you're doing a movement or activism group/free association and a style you want to go with to make yourself stand out from all the other groups, lead by example and make it fun. I can help out with the graphic designs and all that kind of shit if you need it.
