<p>Yeah, Slavros is a pretty smart guy, but he's ultimately one of these guys.....which makes him a retard too.</p>
<p>You had hi hopes? Yeah, you're telling me. When I found this site a few months after the old site went defunct, I was at first glad too see the ITPF had a successor. But soon I realized, these guys were a different breed from the old forum. I was a respected member of the old site, but a "sperg" here. We used to have a good deal of quality members... I don't think many of them are left.</p>
<p>BTW, before we both get banned. Do you have an email, you strike me as someone I'd like to keep in touch with.</p>
