	So how do you make offerings then? Surely, you don't put some food out and just let it rot right? Sorry being blunt, but I am just trying to wrap my head around it. Ha ha and yeah at least we actually read unlike reds who read one book and then suddenly know everything. Of course I am being generous here and assuming they actually read that book (which I doubt many of them do) Also, and this is true, but one day at Uni I will sitting in the hall between classes and reading a book (as I often do) and a guy in my class walked up to me and says "You must be very smart". So I ask him why he thinks that since we don't really know each other and he says "Because you are reading a book for fun". And I could that he was in fact being serious. No sarcasm whatsoever.
