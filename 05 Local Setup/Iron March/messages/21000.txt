	I've been gathering some PDFs for the <a href="http://laraj.ca/AGwiki/index.php" rel="external nofollow">Fascist Archive</a> and modifying some of the existing ones to make the text searchable.  Zeiger hasn't been online so I figured you were the next best person to talk to about adding those.  What's the best way to get those PDFs to you or to add them to the archive myself?
