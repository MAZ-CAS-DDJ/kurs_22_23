<p>Most of the grandparents around are not; they view it as a great blessing and a great help to them that we have come. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of the middle aged and younger people are resentful of American policies -- some for legitimate naionalist &amp; working class concepts, but mostly these are people who are leftist... On some level they are anti-globalist, but they are very... ungraceful, misguided, hypocriical, foolish. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Though, amongst even the left, there are some good folks and intellectuals who are into traditionalism, etc. But many pro-Americans are also into their own sense of traditionalism... merely, the West's technology and the wold become some sort of extension of it... </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most of the far right people are pro-America in a vague sense of the word -- mostly as a refutation of general leftism. They also do not view cooperation with the West as impeding their nationalist agenda.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Korean politics, though, is a very different (&amp; tricky) beast.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You ask a good question... I'll have to think about it more. </p>
