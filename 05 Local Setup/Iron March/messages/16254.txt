	Hi again,
</p>

<p>
	Glad to hear you haven't taken it to heart, and as you say the baptism of fire does also serve a purpose in a place like this. At this point I should also be honest and say that I am affiliated with National Action, hence my interest in your thread and some of your comments. Obviously the general vibe here towards new posters based in the UK is 'get with <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> or get the fuck out'. While that attitude does have merit, as talk is cheap and Fascists should rightly value action above words, it isn't entirely helpful to people like yourself who are simply genuinely uncertain what sort of activities <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> is involved with and would be better served by being given more information, rather than being called a coward.
</p>

<p>
	In terms of your own direct experience of <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>, I can understand why based on what you saw you came to the view that such tactics are ineffective, although naturally I'd like to go into a few of the points you raised. In terms of your comments on medium and message, a demo will never be the best medium through which to educate the public, or convey a nuanced and multi-faceted message. By their nature demo's will always be confrontational to some degree, and are therefore better utilised as a means to display strength, discipline and unity than to get an elaborate point across. If you haven't already, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtcZyyso2ik" rel="external nofollow">video</a> and <a href="http://national-action.info/news/2016/10/05/march-on-berwick/" rel="external nofollow">write-up</a> of the recent demo at Berwick as an example of this. This doesn't mean that those behind the banners and masks are unwilling to engage with the public, it's simply that a demo isn't the optimal time or place for it. However, <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> is not aiming to be simply a reactionary protest movement. While demo's have had and will always have their place, they are not envisaged as being the primary focus of the group's activities going forward.
</p>

<p>
	You seem to already be aware of some of the direct action/community engagement initiatives that <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> is involved with, and as the organisation grows these activities will become more numerous and larger in scope. It's interesting that you say you've been involved in Left-wing activism previously as that's also the case for several others now involved with <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>, myself included. Some that came via the Left were only involved on a social basis, some ideologically, and others as an active part of Leftist groups, but all have brought with them their passion for a range of issues outside the scope of traditional Nationalist groups. Nationalist groups in this country have previously failed to encroach upon the traditionally Leftist territory of animal rights, environmental issues, homeless outreach etc, and as a result Leftist groups have enjoyed a relative monopoly in these areas. In this regard, <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> intends to step on their toes big-time. National Socialism is about the blood AND the soil of our nation, and as such has no hesitation in laying claim to each of these issues as an inseparable part of our greater struggle against Globalism, Capitalism and Materialism in this land.
</p>

<p>
	The membership of <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> represents a genuine cross-section of British and European youth (yay diversity!), and naturally within that there are and will always be people with different skills, different views and different focuses. Individuals will always have their own special snowflake views on certain issues, but that should not be used as an excuse not to get involved. <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> is simply the only group on the Right in this country that not only possesses both significant youth involvement and talent, but is entirely driven by it. You mention that you'd be concerned about being rejected on the basis of not considering yourself explicitly a National Socialist, but the exact words that you put to your views are less important to us than your willingness to actively stand up for them.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of people that we speak to cite reasons related to security and privacy for not getting involved, so naturally if you have any concerns in that regard, or questions about anything else then please let me know and I'll be happy to address them as best I can. I'm based in London but we have regional groups active all across the UK, so chances are there'll be people in your area wherever you are. In the meantime, I'd recommend checking out the <a href="http://national-action.info/" rel="external nofollow">website</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ovCIS6NpgGikjUGw3K--w/videos" rel="external nofollow">youtube channel</a> to learn more about the group's recent activites.
</p>

<p>
	I'd be interested to hear more about the Left-wing activism you were involved in, and the conflicts it sounds like you encountered as a result of being ideologically inconsistent with the rest of the group you were with. For me personally there was a longer time gap involved in going from one to the other with a period of inactivity in the middle, so I didn't experience that conflict so directly.
</p>

<p>
	Hope to hear from you soon,
</p>
