<p>90% correct. Fagcap is just shit. </p>
<p>1. South Western American - his choice of words (feller instead of man). Look at his redneck-isms. I mean, he thinks he's some big cowboy. And he sounds very loud when he spews his crap. I think he lives in the South, considering that he sounds like a bitching redneck.</p>
<p>2. Capitalist - He thinks that Fascism is capitalism, or so at least related. His name is already capitalist. I understand if he wants to be some big capitalist, but not adding the name "Fascist", because it's original form is anti-capitalist and anti-communist.</p>
<p>3. De Terk Er jerbs - No idea about it, but he thinks workers are shit. Not a good Fascist, since true Fascists support Class Collaboration. And also he is butthurt at blacks being free.</p>
<p>4. The South Will Rise Again Cowboy - now i respect people of the south (some of the rednecks, but not all of them), they once had good sense of aristocracy. Well whenever he posts, he sounds like a redneck (marxoid, feller) He also has a lack of respect to others.</p>
<p>5. Toothless - he sounds too crappy. calling me a commie, when i am far from commie. Notice he is very immature. i understand if he accuses me of communism (I am aware i have a socialist in my avatar, but then socialist =/= communist)</p>
<p>AFAIK, he is just too immature for a 47 year old. He wouldn't be typing "pinko" or other choice of lousy words.</p>
<p>BTW, do you have any friends who have sympathies to the DPRK? as in not the liberal rev-left DPRK fan, but the DPRK fan who likes "Military first policy" as a way to keep liberals.</p>
