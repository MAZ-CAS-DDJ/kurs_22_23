	Hello Kulturkampf,
</p>

<p>
	This is Blackshirt 13 here. I just wanted to ask a question about your trip to Italy. As I mentioned before I want to go to Italy someday in order to see Predappio and D'Annunzio's house. I was just wondering if it would be a good idea to invest in learning some Italian? Or would I be able to get by on just English? Also, I am so poor that it would probably take many years of saving up money to in order to go to Italy. So I would probably have time to learn Italian tbh. Thanks for your time and let me know when you get this.
