	I think it's great literature and an excellent pick for required reading.

	I came to Iron March because I'm a political extremist.  Obviously I love George Lincoln Rockwell and William Luther Pierce, but who do we have now? Richard Spencer?

	As others have said, I thoroughly enjoyed Mason's hardcore rhetoric and realism. I particularly enjoyed learning some of the history of the American Nazi Party.  It really opened my mind to the nature and history of our struggle. It's incredible to realize that there was a whole world out there, full of action and motion, it's a shame the way it seems to have fizzled out.

	I've known for some time that if we're ever going to liberate ourselves this system has to collapse first and the book does a good job laying out what must be done.  Plenty of ways to do it without getting killed or going to prison, but if you're operating in a grey area, don't talk to anyone about it.  A movement without leaders is where it's at.

	I was really blown away by the Charles Manson stuff.  It is hard to argue with Mason's reasoning, but it still strikes me as bad propaganda.  I don't know, it doesn't seem like an idea that has gained much traction. "Manson did nothing wrong" doesn't seem to me a fight worth having and I can't see how it has ever advanced our cause.
