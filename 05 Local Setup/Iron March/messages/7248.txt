<p>Also, I freely admit you were right about Turanism here, my fault was that it was (more) popular during early century, when my studies have mostly been focused on 1930s and 1940s, even though I was able to find an article about a Tatar muslim who died during the winter war which also focused on Turanism. I hope to be able to post a comprehensive post about this sometime in the future.</p>
