<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I'm extremely interested in your Integralist Party, despite its inclinations towards corporatism instead of syndicalism. I'd offer aid if I were in Britain instead of Canada.</p>
<p>I just wanted to find out more about you and the Integralist Party, how it was founded, how you came to fascism, how the IP is doing right now, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
