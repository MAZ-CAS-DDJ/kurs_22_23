<p>I don't understand why you cannot post really. i am not good with interwebz tech, but shouldn't a dynamic IP beat any tracking shit as far as is possible? I am pretty sure the site tracks where you are when you post private messages or just log in too.</p>

<p>AS for S America everyone has told me more or less the same thing. I heard there are some really wild jungles that look like a 70s cocaine movie, on top of crocodile hunter shit being everywhere. Like I said it is definitely something I want to see. I remember that white dude that you posted making some sort of dream home; doing that for maybe a year or two is probably the best vacation you can get, but I would put Crimea or any good mountainous black sea coast (like Batumi) equally, the women are definitely better, not in Batumi though, and way different. Skiing is way up there for me, definitely visit the Andes and commune with Miguel Serrano through the astral planes. You said at some point you visited Ukraine; were you there for long?</p>
