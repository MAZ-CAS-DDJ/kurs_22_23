<p>I know quite a lot about that period, we have family friends in Serbia and my family comes from eastern region in Slovenia which was always culturally closer to Croats than to Slovenes (we're part of Slovenian nation only because of some weird circumstances in 18th and 19th century). Also, I've been to Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia like million times and I'm fluent in their language. The problem is that I don't think there are many good books on that period that would be available to foreign crowd. Most of what I learnt was through following Slav-fights on local internet forums and from what people told me. You have some good fights between Croats and Serbs in English too on forums like Stormfront.</p>

<p>Serbs are the most cynical and "proud" about the war, unlike Muslim Bosniaks who are the most moralistic and play the victim all the time. Serbs in Croatia might be exception though, they're extremely pro-commie and victimistic, but Serbs from Serbia proper are legends. Croats are ok but some of them are full of complexes, always comparing themselves with Serbs in everything. And some Serbs on the other hand are complete peasants, they have a lot of Turkish cultural influences too, it can't be denied. Their folk music is basically Turkish sounding. Serb women often look very manly, in general they aren't really attractive looking, but I liked many of them because of personality. I like how confident Serb women are and they're always looking for masculine men. You'll get the best women there if you behave like a primitive barbarian. Well, some of them are attractive too, Ana Ivanović is hot and I like singer <a href="http://youtu.be/vC-yOg89jHk" rel="external nofollow">Milica Todorović</a> , but in general I prefer our Central European women, the Germanic-Slavic mixture we have here.</p>

<p>Serbs have this cool cynical humour, I always liked that about them. I posted something about Šešelj here, he's a perfect example of that: <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/3098-dr-vojislav-%C5%A1e%C5%A1elj/" rel="">http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/topic/3098-dr-vojislav-%C5%A1e%C5%A1elj/</a> I always liked going to Serbia the most out of ex-Yugoslavia, it's much more fun than Croatia, although Croatia has beautiful seaside. I love Serbian food too, I eat tons of it here in Ljubljana, we have good Serbian restaurants and fast foods here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pljeskavica" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pljeskavica</a> . </p>

<p>The good thing about ex-Yugoslavia is that popular culture is the least Americanized. Most clubs would rather play Serb/Bosnian/Croatian music than something foreign and there's tons of good music.</p>

<p>If you ever go to Balkans go to Belgrade or Novi Sad. Serbia is very cheap, especially for you western people, you'll get top food and drinks for nothing. I like how a city like Novi Sad which has less than 250.000 inhabitants lives 24 hours a day, the center is always full of people and there are cool parties every day. I love swimming in the Danube too, they have nice beaches.</p>
