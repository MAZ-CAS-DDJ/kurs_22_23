<p>I was unaware there were White parts of Milwaukee left. Haha. In Racine, it is terrible. This city is revolting to all of my senses. I also have tried starting up more than one group to distribute propaganda, volunteer community services, and patrol some of the near-by poor neighborhoods at night. No one here is serious. Iâ€˜ve had a few Neo-Nazi takers, but we usually spent more time arguing ideology than getting anything done. And everyone is so desperate to be in charge. It is like most National Socialist's these days all see themselves as the Fuhrer reincarnate. Impossible to get anything done. How is Northern Wisconsin? I have visited, and I loved it. More rain in the warm months, more snow in the cold. Beautiful, from what I remember. Definately on my short list of potential places to resettle. How is the political scene there? I do not imagine National Socialism being welcomed with open arms, but perhaps the area is more receptive to similar ideologies? I apologize for the long message, I do get a bit carried at times when speaking or writing.</p>
