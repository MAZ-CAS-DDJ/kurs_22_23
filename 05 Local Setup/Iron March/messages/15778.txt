	Jontron appears in several of franku's videos also he doesn't have the style that I like from Frank , frank didn't start a gaming channel like jontron Frank just takes things from a social culture perspective. His commentary is incredibly deep not to mention the lore of the backstory of his characters which combines a scifi/fantasy element to urban lifestyle.
