<p>Ah yes. I did know that about Hushmail and Safe-mail actually. I chose to use them as a short-term solution until I found something better. I initially considered Riseup, but was put off by their political stance - i.e. I didn't know whether they had the ability to turn stuff over to the authorities if they chose (which I assumed they well might.) Threema looks decent. Other intact messaging services I've been looking into are Retroshare and CryptoCat. Know anything about either of them?</p>

<p>I remember telling Tommy 6 month ago that the police <em>can</em> monitor our messages (and therefore we have to act under the assumption they<em> are</em>.) I suggested Hushmail as an alternative - because at least it was a step up. I told Alex the same thing. As far a I'm aware Tommy's still using text to arrange everything/demo, etc... *sigh*</p>

<p>Cheers on the heads up regarding 192. I'll definitely be following that up.</p>

<p>Yeah, I used to use Tor when I was attempting to establish the North Wet branch of English National Resistance. Gave it up once that ground to a halt and I became less active. Will have to pick it back up if I'm heading sigurd.</p>

<p>By the way, have you any idea on security regarding Wordpress? Not in relation to sigurd, but I'm after running a blog on the side. should I use Tor with that?</p>
