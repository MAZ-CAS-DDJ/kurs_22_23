<p>Got an idea for media attention at the least and redpilling at best. I'm going to apply for a job as a ramp agent at the airport; my friend works as one so there's a good chance I'll get in with this certain company. There are cameras in the baggage dock however there are none inside the luggage compartment on the planes and there is where any propaganda and posters could be dumped/tied to the suitcase. There's no way of knowing who did it for sure unless someone grasses.</p>

<p>Either way it's going to get a message out there. If your enemies don't hate you and specifically talk about you then what's the point?</p>
