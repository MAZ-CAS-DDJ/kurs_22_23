His Silver Legion began as something altogether different. From its inception, its thrust was the attainment of political power, to someday become the U.S. government and establish a state based on the fundamentals of Fascism. Although he admired the Swastika symbol and understood its significance, he knew too, that it was the official emblem of a foreign power. He did not wish to create the impression that he was the agent of another country. Instead , he chose the letter "L" as the symbol of his new organization. It was simple to reproduce under a variety of circumstances and stood for Loyalty to the American Republic, Liberation from materialism and, of course, the Silver Legion itself. He personally designed its flag, a square, white standard emblazoned with a capital L in scarlet.</p></div></div></blockquote>

<p>Right, I remember the L was worn on the shirt. I had a very poorly written book on Pelley, but in one of my moves I seem to have lost it.</p>

<p>If you know of some resource that explains Pelley's fascist beliefs, please direct me to it. My recollection is that he didn't have an actual fascist concept but more of a hodgepodge of mystical and political beliefs that sort of merged into some kind of amorphous philosophy. I could be wrong about that, however.</p>
