<p>Alright, you can move 'A History of Saleam's National Action' and 'Australian National Socialist Party' to historic movements. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You should add the thread 'Eric Campbell's book 'The rallying point' ' to the thread Australian New Guard. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are a couple of movements which we can write up, so we can expand it a bit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cheers</p>
