<p>As a teenager, I know exactly what you mean. There is far too much temptation to oppose even the most sane and eminently clear ideas, especially with regard to religion. One of my school friends is an outspoken atheist, and despite his talk he really doesn't know much about Christianity or religion in general. It's interesting to hear that <em>Mere Christianity</em> was actually a deciding factor for you; for me it simply helped along a process that was already happening, although in my case it was a conscious decision to reread it rather than a new discovery.</p>
<p>On another note, what is your ideology specifically?</p>
