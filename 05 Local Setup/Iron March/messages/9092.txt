<p>Okay so good news, tech support shills were useless but Colonel appeared with a save so now we managed to associate all your old posts and topics to this new profile, we even managed to restore your likes, friends and other such minor details, you just need to update your avatar and signature again.</p>

<p>Your PMs should be restored to your control too but most likely you profile details in them appear as if your account no longer exists but there was nothing we could do to fix that and its not really an issue.</p>
