	I understand what you mean about the forum's attitude toward Kurds, and that's one of the reasons why I wasn't planning on creating an account in the first place. It was only once I saw you here that I decided that you and I must, must, must get in touch, and that's when I signed up in a heartbeat. Otherwise, as you said, this place's benefit is mostly just in browsing its resources and materials. And in fact, I'm thinking of taking our conversation out of this forum soon anyway, and we should discuss Kurdish Fascism and the steps ahead of us in some other way. (And actually, I've already created a website for Kurdish Fascism, and I'm planning to add a forum to it soon. We can migrate and continue the conversation there. Or, before that, we could continue the conversation through PMs in some other website like reddit or something, and then we could migrate to the forum.)

	Regarding the empire and accomplishment thing… you know, I see where you're coming from, but I'm not too worried about it. The way I think about it, I view the Kurdish race as being currently in the same place where the Germanic tribes used to be before the collapse of Rome, or where the Arabs used to be before Mohammad—too surrounded by enemies who are too powerful and wealthy for them to counter. And while we're the barbarians of today, the so-called civilizations around us (the heirs of Ottomans and Achaemenids and Caliphs) are drowning in decay and demoralization, especially the Turks and Arabs. All we need is for the right pieces to fall into the right place, and that's when we will get our chance to pounce. Until then, it really is up to us (the Kurds of today) to lay the roots of that Fascist Worldview that would then always be ready as the clearest and most final expression of the Kurdish spirit, for both the near- and long-term future. And also for now too: since I really do see beauty and strength in the barbarian life of mountains and forests. In fact, a fascist state is by its nature going to be a barbarian state with only mere civilizational facades (i.e. the marriage of Technology with Nature), so its development from Kurdistan's current situation seems to me to be very logical.

	And by the way, these words of yours really struck me:
</p>

<p>
	"<span style="color:rgb(224,224,224);font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(28,28,28);float:none;">We are truly on our own, but we can turn our desolation among human civilisation to our advantage by creating a value system that answers to absolutely nothing and no one but us. I want the Kurds to able to accept everything, true or false, that our detractors say about us, and still find the arrogance to spit in their faces."</span>

I finished the worldview a few months ago, and I've now begun the serious effort to create Kurdish Fascism. You really need to join—or rather, I need you to join. Remember the fasces: stronger together.</span>

	About the assimilation thing, it's actually very admirable that even after a generation of lost Kurds, you've still had the inner spirit to rise again. I have family members who live in Kurdistan and speak Kurdish and are immersed in the culture all day long, and yet they're not a quarter as nationalistic as you. I'm not disappointed at all—very much the opposite, in fact. I'm actually wondering how you were able to rise up again? Was it a singular event or a gradual return to your roots? Do you have memories of Kurdistan? Do you go there? What's the story? I can sympathize because I too was almost assimilated into America when my family came to the US when I was 15, but over time I gradually returned to nationalism. I didn't have it as hard though, since we've always spoken Kurdish and immersed by the culture, and since I was originally born in Kurdistan (the South, specifically) in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, and what other languages do you speak, by the way? Aside from English and Kurdish, I also know a bit of Arabic since it was mandatory in school back in Kurdistan. And I'm also just like you when it comes to kurmanji: I'm just starting out learning it online, although I don't have informal tutors or anything.

	Well, a lot of the Kurds that I've met, at least the ones from Southern Kurdistan, tend to have fascist tendencies that are only cloaked under humanism for propaganda purposes. You're right about those humanistic arguments, and I've seen them myself too—but only on TV and the internet and such. However, when you get down to it and talk to them quietly and alone, a lot of Kurds (even older ones) can show extremely strong (but hidden) expressions of fascism and racism, especially when they're expressing themselves in Kurdish, instead of English or some other language—so that may be another reason why our experiences have differed in this area. I've seen it so many times: I've seen people who would one moment give a speech in English about how Turkey's murder of Northern Kurds is genocidal and violates "human rights", and in the next moment when you're alone with them they tell you in Kurdish that they wish genocide on all of the world's Turks. So yeah, that's what I meant by fascist tendencies: the hidden expression of Higher Truth is there, at their core, and it's just waiting for someone to carry it upward and bring it to the light. And as you said, nowadays this is gradually getting even more extreme and radical.
</p>

<p>
	However, I have to say you're also very right about the slave/master conception, and that most Kurds currently respond like slaves. That is exactly true, and it's one of the conclusions that I've reached as well: that we need to teach Kurds (all the way from childhood) to think like masters no matter what the actual situation is, even if they're currently slaves. We need to develop that type of thinking and Weltanschauung among Kurds. It's going to take a lot of time (generations, perhaps) to fully seep in, but it's never too late, and the sooner we begin the better.
