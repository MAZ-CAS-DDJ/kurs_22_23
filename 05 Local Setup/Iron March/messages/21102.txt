	Ah, that's like an hour from me. I used to drive 4+ hours picking up comrades on the way just to have a little group meeting so that's not that bad at all as far as I'm concerned. Been a long time since I've been to Madison though, I hate driving in that city. lol. Well, whenever you're around. Don't forget to message me. Always happy to meet comrades wherever they are.Â
