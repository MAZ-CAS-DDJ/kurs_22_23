	Gender dysphoria is a disorder in which someone believes they're the opposite gender of what they were assigned at birth. That sounds exactly like your situation. Trans people become trans for 2 reasons, 1) they have gender dysphoria 2) they're attention whores/sexual deviants/overall degenerates. Either way, it's obviously not good and being Trans would be 100% illegal in a Fascist society.

	I meant to say that I don't take it seriously because God's grace can save people from any curse.
