	Well it's mostly what you need to understand The Golden Cord specifically. You can understand EH via Savitri Devi's works as well and it might be more clear than in Serrano's work. I recommend everyone read Evola because he goes in depth into specific traditions (the books listed) and an overall understanding of our worldview in its undifferentiated form. EH is another way to interpret that worldview, our way, but you can get it from just reading Evola and give it more heavily EH leanings with reading Serrano or Devi (in particular her Lightning and the Sun book).

	In order of Authors I'd recommend Evola, Guenon, Schuon and then Savitri Devi, then Serrano.

<p>
	p.s. this isn't really philosophy, Evola detested philosophers as intellectuals.

	I did <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MrH1Tn4.png" rel="external nofollow">write a handy guide for reading Evola</a>, I'll be updating it and publishing it on NOOSE (btw updated review of Serrano's Golden Cord will be up there today) which can be useful.

	However I did make a bunch of graphics to help explain some of the fundamental points of our worldview in an undifferentiated manner, so those can be helpful <a href="https://imgur.com/a/065tm" rel="external nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/065tm</a> , besides all the articles we've written and compiled in the Next Leap anthology <a href="http://laraj.ca/AGwiki/uploads/Contemporary/IronmarchOriginals/IronMarch%20-%20Next%20Leap.pdf" rel="external nofollow">http://laraj.ca/AGwiki/uploads/Contemporary/IronmarchOriginals/IronMarch - Next Leap.pdf</a>

	I could lay out the basics of our worldview in an undifferentiated manner further myself but it'd be a bitch to type out. Get on discord m8, we talk in there fairly often though I'm less active lately because I'm busy reading and other stuff. Point being it can always be discussed in a call in discord.
