	I read about these muslim kids who get like 3 years for posting an ISIS video in some group or whatver and it is like what's the point? I could go to the town centre next friday, suckerpunch some dude, put him in a coma - 12 month suspended sentance, it is like words aare worse than violence. You know you can be arrested for swearing in publicÂ  - it isn't totally commonplace but whenever the police get t chance to abuse their power they do.
