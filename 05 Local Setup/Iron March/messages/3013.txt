<p>Interesting questions. I think that women should choose their husbands and enter into a subordinate life willingly. They should also have the right and freedom to leave that relationship for appropriate reasons, i.e. domestic abuse.  As far as a woman participating in government I guess it would depend on the capacity.  I don't know if i would ever vote for a woman, but if we are discussing whether a woman should have the right to vote well I think they should. Whether or not a woman votes after marriage is a discussion that should be had between the man and woman. Do you use skype by any chance?</p>
