	Well, the only real advice I have is to make sure not to make a thread that already exists. You can use the search bar on the top right to check for content using keywords.<br /><br />
	Other than that, be advised that violence and Hitler-worship is the order of the day here. I don't know how crazy you are about being a <em>fanatic</em> like a lot of the people here, but keep this in mind. If you criticize Hitler or argue against using violence to achieve political goals, people are gonna give you a hard time.<br /><br />
	Ironmarch is very much a fan of the "no compromise" approach to things.<br /><br />
	I wouldn't worry about getting banned for it or anything, though. You've got a good head on your shoulders, and it shows.
