<p>As of recently we have 2500 homeless soldiers, none of which have received any help, and there are nearly 59000 people waiting for government housing in Ontario alone which was given to refugees, on top of that soldiers who were stationed at bases who do not own a home or have no family were forced out of barracks for refugees at Christmas. Our funding for the military has now dipped below 1% of our total GDP and now we have ambulance chasers going after soldiers similar to what is happening to British soldiers. With Trudeau in office he will surely try to liberalize our military into some multi ethnic travesty. We have some of the best soldiers if not the best(Subject to debate) and we are constantly hidden from our nation as if we are an embarrassment and savages. The college I go to, during remembrance day not a single student wore a poppy, did not even care about the lives lost in battle. The general soldier is not pleased with civilians and they have a right to feel that way.</p>
