<p>Enver Pasha died a glorious death, outnumbered and facing the enemy. I have heard various accounts of his death. In some, he fell while charging into the enemy, blade and Quran in hand, others say he felled by machine gun fire while shooting at the Bolsheviks. I do not believe the account which says he was killed in hiding by some Armenian.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have read an interesting account about Enver Pasha in the <a href="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89092588227;view=1up;seq=9" title="External link" rel="external nofollow">memoirs</a> of Rafael Nogales. Armenians like to quote Nogales selectively to support their genocide claims, while ignoring the fact that Nogales had a very high opinion of Turkish soldiery, and also notes atrocities committed by Armenians.</p>

<p>No, he wasn't killed by an Armenian, it was Talat Pasha who perished at the hands of one.</p>
<p>And thanks for sharing this piece with me. I haven't read it before, and I will as soon as I have time to do so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for Enver Pasha, after our war for independence was realized, a smear campaign was enacted against him for a single botched campaign to relieve the pressure on the Germans by attacking the Russians through the Caucasus.</p>
<p>The Battle of Sarıkamış, a defeat, yet one that is still a victory of the Turkish spirit herself, is being shown as the fault of the "Turanist daydreamers" and has often been used as such to devalue our great cause. Enver Pasha was a great man, and a patriot, a nationalist that thought outside of our borders, and went to Central Asia to aid his brethren in their fight for freedom.</p>
<p>He should be hailed as a hero as much as Atatürk.</p>

<p>Your country hosts thousands of Syrian Arabs in state of the art facilities, 200 of your ethnic kin shouldn't be a problem. Why has the government shown such reluctance?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Who knows why. The current Government did some things that did not occur to the previous governments, like they visited Eastern Turkestan to meet the Uyghur people. However it was all a show, and nothing more than a priviliage granted by the Chinese to those that had made their customary bows to the Emperor that the Chinese now call "Chairman". So, as with the Inönü single-party regime that handed Turkish refugees to the Russians to be butchered, they too would have let the Uyghurs rot in Thailand, if the public outcry did not stop them from doing so.</p>

<p>Indeed, I can imagine how frustrating it must be to see your government granting concessions to terrorist and separatist Kurds. Such a course of action will likely only embolden them to make further demands.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the American Southwest, there are high schools which have banned students from displaying the American flag, while Mexican flags are permitted. A Federal Appeals court has even upheld these bans, and its possible that the issue will reach the Supreme Court. This is to say nothing of the Atzlan separatist groups which operate openly, or the bile spewed regularly on University campuses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The government refuses to decisively tackle the illegal immigration issue, instead preferring to make oblique promises about "securing the border" and "immigration reform". Meanwhile, the illegal immigrants continue to benefit from American social services, education, and healthcare, while pumping out ever more children. Some traitorous politicians have even suggested that we should give the illegal immigrants a "path to citizenship".</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The real problem is that these immigrant groups are so tightly packed, they are resistant to the assimilation tactics of the American state that has employed these ever since its creation. The worst thing that can happen to a country is when a minority accumulates at a certain spot, and begins to grow like a tumor, being harmful while using national resources. The only thing to determine here is whether the tumor is malignant or benign.</p>
<p>In the first case cutting it off from your body might be the only choice, of course, if it has not grown beyond a point where surgical interference is not life threatening to the country. In the second case, you might also let the tumor be in there instead of going through the lenghty surgical procedure, as the growth is stagnant, though it still leaches off of the resources of the country while giving nothing back.</p>

<p>Sadly, they are ignoring the harm they are inflicting on their descendants by instilling the victim mentality inside them. Armenia has sold its self-determination to Russia, and depends heavily on diaspora Armenians. I have noticed that without <em>Hye Tahd</em> (the campaign for Armenian Genocide recognition), American Armenians would have been assimilated a long time ago. Amusingly, some Armenians refer to the assimilation of diaspora Armenians as a "White Genocide" (<i>Spitak Jard</i>, a concept similar to the Jews' "Silent Holocaust"). I for one cannot fathom how they have the right to demand a separate existence, if anything, if they hold such views, then they should buy a one-way ticket to Yerevan if they feel so 'oppressed' in America. After all, if I didn't like the US, I could try to become a naturalized Chinese citizen (this would actually be quite difficult).</p>

<p>Well, once the "victim" always the victim. The Jews also cry persecution at every occasion, and so do they. But unlike the Jews, that encourage their brethren to return to their ancestral homeland, the Armenians don't want them, else they would cut off the significant vein that supplies them with the necessary nutrients that Armenia needs to be.</p>
<p>However, Armenians lack the inherent drive to oust foreign elements like the Jews, so they are more susceptible to outside influence than Jews, and are quick to use the victim mentality as a way to instill such a drive inside their brethren. "White Genocide" they have called it, so that their kin might show a reaction.</p>
<p>But they won't go back. For they lack another thing that the Jews do have. The Jew's notion of a "homeland" is part of their national identity. The Armenians lack this one too, so no Armenian would ever leave the lukewarm conditions of the western world for the harsh and rough existence of the Caucasus. They probably would not even get along well with their more fatalistic and burly kin in Armenia due to the extremes in their outlook on life.</p>
