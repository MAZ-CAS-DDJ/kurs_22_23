	Yeah like I said in the thread, you can translate stuff like that to whatever local jokes/terms/phrases you have to make it authentically greek rather than a literal translation, so whatever equivalents work, stuff like the titles have even more leeway, you can modify most of those however you see fit.

	I couldn't do a literal translation of some stuff into Russian so I just used whatever felt would work with the given element from Russian humor and references. For instance Millennial as a term or concept doesn't really exist here so I went for a Russian word which is meant to be a kind of pun/derogatory term derived from the word forÂ "schoolkid", to designate a kind of negative attitude + one's young age.

	Basic goal is to deliver the point and use acceptable replacements where it doesn't really matter, but most of all it has to be organic so that any greek can look at the website and understand everything without having to look it up. You can use uniquely Greek cultural references as well.
