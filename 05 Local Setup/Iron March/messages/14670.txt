	Hey Xav, any news cites you recommend? Like Right On or Daily Stormer? Stumbled across Right On last night, has me a little curious as to wither this is a good news cite or not. Really didn't hang around long though. I have pretty much just stopped watching the news or reading the paper because it is always the same shit and depressing as hell. On the bright side not watch the news or reading the paper has given me a new saying, "I don't need to watch the news or read the paper to know that society is going to shit, I just look around".
