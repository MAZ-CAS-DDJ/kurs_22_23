<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Jacob introduced me to your Knights of Avalon movement, which is of interest to me especially as your planned "Avalon" would I'm sure encompass a good chunk of my western Canadian homeland. It's nice to see a good Christian movement as well, which brings me to my key point. What would be the attitude of you schismatics to any good Catholic folk living in your area?</p>
