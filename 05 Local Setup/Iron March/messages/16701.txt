	I put Idubbbz and the Aussies in the same category based on their interactions with Frank , they're videos all involve extreme gross out factors for views.

<p>
	I separate their humor from Frank's because they don't include the aesthetic philosophical and existentialism ideas that Frank subtly touches on through his use of comedy , facial expressions multiple characters and music choices. Frank created a world, they just do stuff for laughs in a certain way Frank is on a completely different level.

	I mean Frank criticizes all the shit in the world and turns it back against the world in a way that makes you smile but feel good in an existential way. He's just this goofy kid that dresses up and does voices but he just makes me feel like there's some hope in the world. Personal inward hope that maybe we can be free in our own world like he portrays. I guess , that's why I like him.
