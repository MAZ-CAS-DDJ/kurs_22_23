<p>I've got a bunch of league of rights newsletters that me old boy gave to me, there is actually a really awesome article on nationalist economics amongst the usual boomer conspiracy bull-shit and quite a few good racialist one, they are Anglophiles, I'd like to read through some and make a few threads on them, when I get a chance. Need an Australian Action thread in the shrimp bunker too, been throwing up doing something on Anzac Day, get Kalash to do up some 'The Anzacs didn't die for this liberal, Marxist faggoty, awaken white man! ' something similar to that, Anzac Day is a big thing here, a lot of people, all white, come from far and wide as our significance in the legend is quite profound, it's mostly boomers and old codgers and diggers but would atleast plant a seed in a few blokes heads...maybe carry the Australian action namesake for a few other activist postering campaigns, will see, fucking working away inhibits me doing a lot of shit, take it easy lads and hopefully that Russo-phile Northen territory bloke reads ANM story and realises the worth of our great land haha!</p>
<p>Cheers </p>
