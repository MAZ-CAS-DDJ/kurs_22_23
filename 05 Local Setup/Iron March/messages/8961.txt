<p>May I ask who this is? And thanks, it meant a lot being given a platform and being able to put my efforts into something worthwhile.</p>
<p>Regarding Cryptocat, I've been looking over it and as it's open source, its constantly being improved. I doubt there was any malicious intent behind messages disappearing. Sometimes these new apps are just tricky. I personally feel its decent. But I understand your concerns.</p>
<p>I must say, I've not heard of SubRosa but I'll give it a look into and read some audits. </p>
<p>I've found an interesting app called TextSecure you guys might be interested in. If you'd like my email to send you stuff and talk more in depth, its drakonc@protonmail.com</p>
