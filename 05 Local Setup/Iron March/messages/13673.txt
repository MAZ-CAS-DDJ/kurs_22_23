	They have essentially no one in the east. They don't have any history of action that I know of. Calling them an influence is stretching it, seeing as I've never heard of them doing any action. I could be wrong on that, I just have never heard of it or seen threads. Yes, apparently they want to burn a flag in a month or so (in California, of course, because that's where they almost all are from) at a Trump rally. We will not be involved in this for obvious reasons. That leaves us with just ourselves. Reaction is not a well formed presence. <br />

	I hate the name "ReactionUSA." It sounds neo-reactionary, not national socialist. I think we can cooperate with Reaction without really being under Reaction. Atomwaffen was separate from Reaction for a reason, and that reason still stands as yet another negative. They're really far away. On the east coast, I am mere hours away from the guy organizing the Silver Legion. <br /><br />
	I will not be joining ReactionUSA, at least not until they've proven themselves to be legitimate in my eyes. I will be focusing my attentions and organizational powers on Silver Legion, as it is in my eyes a venture with more potential. But that's just my two cents, and you should do whatever you want. The important thing is activism, not really who you do it under, so just keep that in mind :) spreading national socialism is the main goal here.
