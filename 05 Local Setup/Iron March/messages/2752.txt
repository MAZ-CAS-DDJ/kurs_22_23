<p>I will answer the first three questions now because im fucked up busy with Uni, and later i will answer the rest of them</p>
<p>1) I will answer what attracted me to Golden Dawn, at first, because its how things began! I was a fervent Nationalist you could say, basically I had strong patriotic sentiments since my childhood and a personality craving for the extremes. This, and the fact that when i was in my early teens there was the thing we down here call "the Myth of Golden Dawn", a mystical aura surrounding the name of the organization, indicating a dynamic and to-the-extremes organization, attracted me! Now concerning NS, when i first joined i was a fervent nationalist and despised Nazism, in the terms that "we fought the gerries in the War, how can we idolize them?"! That changed when i dwellt into NS ideology and philosophical works, and it made it clear for me that NS was the most pure and sincere form of Nationalism, the nationalism of the blood, tradition and land!</p>
<p>2) The thing with WNs is that their philosophy and main ideas are flawed and as such their tactics come out equally flawed. What makes me content with them is their lack of bones to adress issues as they really are and play with words in order not to be labeled the "bad words", sometimes getting to the point to look like utter clowns!</p>
<p>3) Of course! Times have changed, things are going on faster and farther, and the world struggle is played in larger scales. Now Europe faces Asian Coalitions from the right, the Yanks from the left and an enraged African population from below. A landmass with only 700.000.000 indigenous people has to face 5 billion people surrounding it. Thats why the fraternal competitions of the past, must remain there and not resurface, if we want to protect our sovereignity, our culture and our values from the hoards of Afro-Asian invaders and past-Atlantic corruptors!</p>
