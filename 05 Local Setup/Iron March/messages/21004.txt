	Damn. I wanted to answer at the 11th but it doesn't matter anyway.

	So!

	I realized that instead of replying to you with bullshit like "I will ask this guy and that guy" I will just ask them around first and then I'll tell you what they had to say. I'll be honest with you too, in this month I was occupied with some boring IRL stuff and spent 2 weeks without internetz, also this weekend I will meet a comrade so you will have to wait a little longer for the answer to your giga-mail.

	The last time IM went down (for maintenance, but still) I realized that without it we would be cut off from each other so here is my mail address in the case of SHTF: V451T4[at]protonmail.com

<p>
	Take care!
