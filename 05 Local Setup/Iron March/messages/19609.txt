	You can talk to "Pestis Erik von Kristoph", on Facebook. I'm leaving any idea of organizing ourselves in the trash. I never saw how AW was going anywhere at all, tbh. Was Odin just planning put out the order to "attack", and we all pull some Turner Diaries shit and save the Race? Anyone who doubts the lone-wolf tactics needs to go take a look at the "revolutionaries" thread, and check out the K/D ratio of groups vs loners in the US.Â
