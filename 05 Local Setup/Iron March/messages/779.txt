What are your thoughts on said recession? Good you got out of that Libertarian stuff we have the wrong culture for that type of liberty. What's your favorite book from Rand, I like the Fountain Head. I know a bit about Franco but not much about Pinochet and I recently heard the name "Alfredo Stroessner" was a Fascist Capitalist too? I admire south america National Capitalism it has kept them free and independent for years.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>I don't like to give up alot of info. about my business on the interweb just in case some anti Fascist hacker or whatever decides to hack me and list that "the owner of this business is a Fascist!! Don't buy from him!!!!" We can't afford any dang consumer strikes from these sheeple. We weren't effected by the recession and never took a handout, which is beneath the dignity of any true Capitalist. My view on the crisis is that its totally and fully the result of the government interveneing in the market to much. Case in point the goverment forced banks to give cheap loans to muds to buy houses there asses could never afford. Then we have the root problem which is the FED artificially lowering interest rates will nilly for decades which creates malinvestment that the market then if forced to clear at some point. When the Big Government steps in with all this stimulis crapola it just prevents the market clearing process from happeneing which prolongs the crisis.</p>
<p>My favorite book from Ms. Rand is Atlas Shrugged and I *LOVED* the film that came out about it last year. Alfredo Stroessner was a good man, alot like Pinochet. The Fascist Capitalists in Latino American were good men and did a great job considering the horrible nonWhite human capital they had to work with!</p>
<p>How are ya doing today cutie pie?</p>
