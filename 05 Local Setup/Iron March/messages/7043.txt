<p>Fuck it man I'm a bit drunk now, I've been drinking with my buddy from boxing and some high school friends, but I have to reply to this one.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with this anti-Slav thing is that people are too ignorant to understand that Slavs aren't one and the same. We (Central European Slavs) are something completely different to Russians. Now, I have nothing against Russians and other eastern Slavs but personally I always found pan-Slavism extremely annoying because it always ends up with Russians patronizing us. Slovenes from Carniola and Styria are basically Germans culturally, or even more correctly - Austrians. <a href="http://oi59.tinypic.com/ohk4lf.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://oi59.tinypic.com/ohk4lf.jpg</a> This is how Nazis viewed Slovenians back in 1940, as you can see Styrians are classified as Windish and Carniolans as Slovenes. Slovenians from Carinthia were always considered as Windish too. Windish was basically a classification for Slavs with German culture who happen to speak a Slavic language. The tiny spot in eastern Slovenia, that's Prekmurian ethnicity, that's my ancestry. Historically we were part of Hungarian kingdom, we speak a language different from the rest of Slovenian and culturally we're much closer to Croats and Hungarians than to other Slovenes. We're only "Slovenes" right now because of random historical circumstances. Since 1918 (when we were ceeded to Yugoslavia) our languare is considered as a mere dialect of Slovene. During WW2 though we were considered as Wendish/Vendic people by Hungarians, ie. Slavs with Celtic origins loyal to Hungarian state. Had the Nazis won we would not only be preserved as a community, our (Slavic) micro-language would have much more rights than it has now. My Slavic great-grandfather was a Hitler supporter, he rode with bycicle to German Austria to read the news about WW2 every day. Anyway, that's just our personal story, we're basically a micro-ethnicity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let's not forget the example of Lusitan Sorbs, a Slavic ethnicity living in Reich since day 1 and nobody bothered them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The problem with Slavs in Central Europe is that some of these nations (Czechs and Slovenes) chose a potato nigger peasant nationalism (similar to that of the Irish) which produced some sort of proto-Bolshevik identity blaming everything on Germans who supposedly "oppressed" them for 1000 years during the "first reich". In reality, these two nations are 100% German culturally and that's what Hitler and the Nazis thought too. Any oppression that was made during WW2 was justified because these two nations were merciless towards German minority after 1918. Croats and Slovaks on the other hand had same feelings for Hungary but nationalisms of these two nations turned extremely pro-Nazi in WW2 and they're both pro-German nations.</p>

<p>I can go into details here, I'm a history student and Central European history is my field of study. Hard to explain these things in short, but I hope you get the point.</p>

<p>Personally, I don't feel like I have much in common with Russian Slavs. I respect them but German speaking Austria and Hungarians are closer to me culturally. I'll be a bit controversial here - I believe Central European Slavs have as much Slavic blood as them, only that the non-Slav part we mixed with is Germanic, while they're mixed with Tatars or some other non-Europeans (fucking truth no matter what anyone says, I just didn't feel like raising this issue out of respect to admins and because I don't think it's important enough to creat a drama here). Russia is the most racially-mixed country in history, they had like millions of different tribes on their territory. Poles are better, a proud nationalistic Catholic nation, although I was never their biggest fan, but they definitely deserve more respect than Russians. I respect anti-Nazi poles because they fought for true nationalist reasons, while Russians were simply commie untermensch, I don't care how much they try to excuse them. My grandparents saw those Russian "Aryans" and Asiatic cruelty when they occupied our part of Europe in 1945, quartering random people (alleged "traitors"), stealing everything they could get their hands on, even Slavic women were sexually abused etc. Speak to anyone old enough from eastern parts of Austria or Hungary and they will tell you what those Russians were like. In the memory of those people Germans will always remain noble compared to "liberators" no matter what.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To me, Russia and USA are two empires loosely connected to Western civilization which through historical circumstances also happened to be our biggest enemies in WW2. I'd love to see them turn to a NS/WP state, but reality is that it is very unlikely. Britain also lost everything because of merchant mentality and leadership, and France is even worse. That's why German was a positive force in both WW1 and WW2, for entire Europe. Spain and Hungary also deserve big respect because those countries were always on the right side, through entire European history.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyway, thinking about Slavs as a one big monolithic group is like thinking the same of Germanics. Let's face it, Germans and English were always the noble Herrenvolk Germanic-speaking people, while other Germanics haven't contributed much to anything and there's no reason to give them a pass to claim the same imperial heritage just because they happen to speak a similar language. Central Europeans (ex-Habsburg countries) share a common heritage no matter what language we speak. Personally I always hated both nordicism and mediterraneanism because I always felt like we in Central Europe are right in the middle. A lot of people mistake anti-Nordicism for being anti-Germanic but it's actually opposite with me, I always considered as a fact that most of those who were a creative force among Germanic nations were non-Nordic (as in not being 100% Nordic). This Nordic ideal is insulting to Central European Germans who happen to be heavily Alpinid most of the time. So they're inferior to some faggots in Sweden? On the other hand I'd never say that some wogs are superior because of some 2000 year old glory in Rome or whatever they claim. Both groups are annoying to me. Many Spaniards and Italians simply look like Gypsies to us here, we'll always consider them as such, it's cultural. Anyway, the ski racer Anna Fenninger is a perfect example of Alpine-Nordish beauty of our women here, she's our sex symbol here.</p>

<p>Personally, I really like Slovaks and their NS scene, they have one of the best NS scenes in Europe. Their skinheads are simply genuine tough guys, and they have great music too, we have good contacts with them. I listened <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffM0QKCFM9k" rel="external nofollow">this song</a> like a million times, genuine patriotic crypto-NS song by one of the best RAC bands around. Notice how many likes and views it has, it's huge for a country like Slovakia.</p>

<p>You'll never be dissapointed if you go to Serbia, I guarantee you that. The coolest country in Europe by far. I was at Serbian restaurant today, they have best food in Europe <a href="http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/b3/cc/67/das-ist-valter.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/b3/cc/67/das-ist-valter.jpg</a> I'd eat tons of this shit and drink a bottle of rakija after it</p>
