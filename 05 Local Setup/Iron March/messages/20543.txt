<p>
	Man, I hope you can pardon this extremely long delay. I really do apologize.
</p>

<p>
	The delay wasn’t without reason though. To be honest, I almost tried thinking of some excuses as to why it took so long, but eventually I decided to just be straight-up frank with you about it: basically, the total shift in my worldview caused me to go through a big crisis of faith, especially as I had to leave my former comrades in the Kurdish youth group I was a part of, and I also finally had to admit to myself that my previous worldview (Kurdish nationalism) was not only false but also satanic.
</p>

<p>
	It’s not easy to go from believing something with all your heart, and then finally reach the conclusion that what you used to believe was completely wrong. I actually kept changing this message throughout the whole time, and the message I’m sending you now is nothing like what I started with, because a lot of what I used to believe in has completely changed. And I really do take these things very seriously (I don’t consider Faith/Truth to be some little issue, but in fact it’s a matter of life and death). So I felt quite dead over the past few months, just going through the motions with work and everything, until I gradually climbed out of the abyss and made sense of the chaos, and now I’m out of there and I’ve realized the new order of things.
</p>

<p>
	To start with, my ideal isn’t even what it used to be anymore. From now on, my ideal has become: firstly a fascist world, and secondly a fascist Iran. Sounds almost unbelievable? Especially considering the things I was sending you a few messages ago, how could this total reversal have happened… Well, honestly, the more I thought about it, I had to admit that there’s really no escape from this conclusion—the ideal is either the complete victory of Truth in the entire universe, or it’s nothing.
</p>

<p>
	And yeah, I left the Kurdish nationalist group, much to the anger of the other guys. I told them that from now on I support Iranian nationalism and I just want Iran to take over all of Kurdistan, since the whole issue is just a sub-conflict within the greater fascist world-conflict. And of course Kurds are Iranian anyway, so the best situation for Kurds would be for all that land to be under one united Iran. Anyway, the guys were so shocked by the change and they couldn’t understand what I was saying at all. But well, after taking Kurdish nationalism to its final conclusion, I realized that it cannot be and can never be in the service of God/the Aryan Truth, but in fact it is destined to always be in the service of the devil/Jewish falsehoods. Kurdish nationalism will always be a step downward toward the abyss and toward Satan, whereas Iranian nationalism can be a step upward toward Truth and from there toward God. So I knew I had to leave, since telling them that all Kurds have to be a part of Iran basically meant that any Kurdish nationalist group’s entire struggle is pointless. Of course, the other guys still told themselves that it’s not so. But again, I personally take these things very seriously, and I can only serve that which I truly believe in.
</p>

<p>
	But you know, even now, my Iranian nationalism isn’t like the blind chauvinism I had for Kurdistan, because now I look at Iran from a higher plane (from that of the fascist struggle as a whole, on a cosmic sense). Back then I wanted fascism/God to serve Kurdistan, but now I want Iran to serve fascism/God. It’s basically a total reversal, and that’s why it took me a bit longer to pull it all together and admit where I truly stand. “Do we want God to serve us, or do we want to serve God?” The other guys chose the former, but I chose the latter.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	*  *  *  * 
</p>

<p>
	So that’s how I got here. Now, the only problem I have from this point on is… well, where am I going to apply my abilities from now on? That’s actually the biggest part of the crisis of faith I mentioned earlier—feeling lost as to how I can contribute to the fascist struggle. Where the hell am I going to go now?
</p>

<p>
	There are no real fascist parties inside Iran, and not even any genuine fascist youth groups, mostly because the current Islamic government is powerful enough that it can squash any fascist groups (whereas in Iraqi Kurdistan everything is so chaotic that there’s barely any law and order in a traditional systematic sense [though there is very strict law and order in a tribal sense, but that’s a different matter]). Anyway, I can’t even speak Persian at the moment, so this part of the struggle will have to wait until I become fluent in the Persian language (which I will, absolutely). After that, I’ll dig my way into Iranian nationalism somehow and I’ll become truly involved in it.
</p>

<p>
	And then, for the greater esoteric struggle… well, I looked around at the various groups in the US and none of them were satisfactory enough either. Groups like the NSM or the current American Nazi Party—these are just filled with trailer trash, druggies, larpers, the lowest of the low. Then you have groups like the Trad Workers, who are a bit better but who are still not ideal. Heimbach is a fat nerd and I don’t know how anyone can stand listening to him, let alone take his plans seriously, which are wrong anyway (they seem to aspire to the “break up the world into different peoples with each race in its own homeland” mentality, which is below the Total Aryan Victory/the Apocalyptic Ideal which we discussed earlier). The only American group that I admire enough is AW, and I respect Russell and those guys, but I’m not sure if they’d allow me into AW anyway. (I’m olive-skinned by the way. Brown dad, white mom. Both Kurds.) But even then, AW isn’t spiritual enough for my tastes, and that poses yet another problem.
</p>

<p>
	The closest thing to a real fascist group in recent times was <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>, which was indeed very admirable, but even <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> was too materialistic and it didn’t have the necessary spiritual vision either. Even Greece’s Golden Dawn is too materialistic as well, just as Italy’s original Fascist Party was also too materialistic. Compare that to the NSDAP or Iron Guard, which were true religious cults and actual holy orders, and you’ll see what’s lacking among contemporary fascists. (Although, come to think of it, I’d venture to say that even the NSDAP and Iron Guard didn’t go far enough either. I have this idea, that if a fascist group doesn’t spend a good chunk of its efforts on alchemy and astrology and other Traditional sciences, then it really isn’t fascist enough, regardless of how successful it is on other fronts. What do you think about that?)
</p>

<p>
	Basically, I want an NSDAP/Iron Guard to join, but it doesn’t exist! I just want a true fascist cult/holy order to devote myself to. I’m not really interested in girls or friends or family or marriage or anything; I just want to be part of a holy order with high-quality comrades. To be honest with you, this whole spiritual crisis made me want to go and start such a group by myself. If I can’t join a fascist holy order—hell, I’ll just go make one. The main problem is in actually having the necessary spiritual strength to do so. It’s one thing to say “I’m returning to the Truth”; it’s a totally different thing to actually do it. The Protestants said they were returning to the Truth of Christianity, but look what they’ve done. As you mentioned earlier, due to their lack of spiritual strength all they ended up doing was to create endless fragmentation, and now every Protty and his mother has his own little church. So compare that to what we’re facing today, with us fascists saying that we’ll return to the One Truth of all existence… what spiritual strength must that take, especially in our fallen era? If we’re serious about this, all fascists must truly aspire to become so unfathomably perfect, so sinless, so virtuous—it has to be something completely out of this world.
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, so that’s the basic summary of where I stand now. I’m pretty sure we agree on almost everything, don’t we?
</p>

<p>
	Also, what are your plans regarding your work for the fascist future? Will your struggle be dual like mine (fascism for the world, then fascism for Hungary/Europe), or do you have something else in mind? I’m curious to hear how you intend to go about things.

<p>
	I finished reading the English translations of the Hungarian traditionalists (including a few additional articles that I found myself after searching around a bit). Reading Hamvas was such a joy. He’s a very thoughtful and sincere thinker. It’s a real shame that only few of his works are available in English. You can tell that this is a man who really thought about the problems of existence. In many of his articles, I felt like every sentence could be a quote of its own. And it’s not that he’s saying anything new (in fact, I already agreed with a lot of what he was saying and I just found myself nodding along), but it’s just that the way he says it and the way he phrases it is done in such a fresh way that it always shines a new light on age-old problems and eternal ideas.
</p>

<p>
	Hamvas’ absolutely best article I’d say is definitely the one about Beethoven’s 7th symphony, which was truly a marvelous read. And also the one on friendship was very good too. The only Hamvas article I didn’t like was the preface to Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, mainly because he insults Hitler and fascism many times in that article. At some point in that article Hamvas even says: “Existentially corrupt states may, in the interests of the intact existence of humanity, be dismantled by the union of nations. Such states, above all, are fascist and communist states. The existence of a terroristic and totalitarian and corrupt and avaricious and money-mongering regime prevents the intact existence of all the other nations.” And by that point I was just shaking my head and I was like… dude, what the fuck, am I reading Allied propaganda or something?
</p>

<p>
	Have you read that article by the way? I suppose this is what you meant when you said Hamvas had humanistic tendencies. He’s a bit too soft, too cucky, and that’s the one big problem I had with him.
</p>

<p>
	But anyway, I found the Baranyi article to be the best out of all of them (although I’m still working my way through the Laszlo aphorisms, which are very promising too, since I’m only half-way through and I’ve already received so much insight from them). I can see that Baranyi’s writing has clearly influenced much of the things you talk about. Have you ever gone to see him speak at public events or anything? I was surprised when I found out he’s still alive and all.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The way I’ve gotten to think about it, and considering how the later stages of WWII gradually transformed into a pan-European/pan-fascist battle against the combined forces of degeneracy, I imagine that Hitler would have reached the same conclusion we’ve reached: namely, an earthly ideal of an Empire uniting the various nations (quality reigning over quantity), which then simultaneously works toward creating the future heavenly ideal of eventually nothing remaining but the purest Aryan perfection (end of the world/the apocalypse/the one highest quality). Hitler would have thus mastered both earth (the Empire of nations) and Heaven (the apocalyptic Aryan perfection).
</p>

<p>
	But again, sadly WWII was lost, and Hitler didn’t end up reaching that state. I do believe though (from a materialistic perspective) that He definitely could have done it. Then again, if we accept the march of fate (from a spiritual perspective), you could say that this was all fate and that WWII had to happen the way it did.

	Did you check it out by the way? What did you think? Solar af, innit eh? And by the way, the biggest Kurdish tradition during Newroz is that they jump over the fire, which is pretty interesting how some other Iranian and Aryan cultures do it too (like the tradition of Kupala among the Eastern Slavs). It’s really fascinating, like we’re looking at fragments of some greater past, and it’s all scattered around the world.

			Hafez

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Since we’re on the subject of Persian mystics, I’ve always enjoyed reading both Hafez and Rumi a lot. One big problem with them by the way is that it’s really easy to misinterpret what they mean. Just read any modern description of Hafez and you’ll see that most people nowadays have no idea what he was talking about. I’m sure neither Rumi nor Hafez were degenerate, but that is unfortunately how the modernist view makes them seem. I’d say in my view, Rumi was the more spiritually advanced/solar one, whereas Hafez seems darker and more shadowy, but he was definitely great too (although, you know, sometimes it’s hard to interpret Hafez’s frequent mentions of alcohol as allegorical). So I have some more reservations on Hafez’s mysticism, but a bit less so in the case of Rumi. (Of course, I could be wrong though. Hafez’s outer darkness could be concealing an inner light, and Rumi’s outer light could be concealing an inner darkness. I still do have that suspicion.)
</p>

<p>
	But you know, regarding their broader image in the Middle East, I have some bad news for you (maybe you know this news already, but just in case)… so the thing is, both Rumi and Hafez are seen pretty similarly nowadays: they’ve become the “SJW guys” for the Muslim liberal crowd. Liberals keep quoting Rumi and Hafez so much, so much, and it’s always done in order to find some excuse for liberal decadence (sex, alcohol, even gay and tranny shit sometimes believe it or not), and especially over the past year I’ve seen so many liberal Muslims constantly sharing Rumi and Hafez quotes that it has indirectly put me off both of them. Shit, if I see another picture of a flower with some Rumi quote about tolerance or some Hafez quote about love, I’m going to go nuts. Again, I know that the original meanings of their poems aren’t about physical decadence but about divine love (for the most part at least), but yeah, these days… Hafez, Rumi… pretty much they’re one of the most obvious ways to identify a liberal Muslim. Someone quotes Hafez? 100% guarantee he has a libshit face. Someone quotes Rumi? 200% guarantee she has a fat liberal face. Did you know about this phenomenon? It’s just like the conversation we had a while ago about atheists quoting the Roman stoics. Remember that? Atheists look at Epicurus talking about ataraxia, and they conclude “See guys, peace and pleasure and humanity and shit.” It’s pretty much the same with Hafez and Rumi, except here it’s Muslim libshits doing it (a lot of times it’s because they’re too afraid to say such things themselves, so they’re like, “Hey, if it’s a misinterpreted Hafez quote though, I won’t get in trouble for it”).

<p>
	Yeah, my idea was along the lines of a monastic order of fascists, which would have remained intact regardless of success or failure in the war—you know, like the various Christian or Sufi monasteries that have remained regardless of what has happened around them. It really disappoints me that Evola never did this. He could have set up fascist orders, he could have set up monasteries, he could have created some sort of initiation centers, etc, but he never did any of that. It’s such a great loss for us who are here now.

			The problem of Free Will
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Interesting perspective you have. My idea has always been that we have no free will, and that we’re just in God’s hands, where only God’s Will matters and ours doesn’t. Perhaps this is because I grew up in a Muslim society, where the greatest emphasis is always placed on God’s Will and it’s all about how “we are all God’s slaves.” (For example, as you probably know, the popular name “Abdullah” literally means “Slave of God” in Arabic. And also, the Arabic word for “worship” is “ibada,” which literally means “enslavement.” It comes from the word “abd” which means “slave.” So for example, in Arabic when you say “the worship of God,” you actually say “ibadat-u-llah,” which translated literally would mean “enslavement to God,” but figuratively/poetically it means worship.)
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, so I remember we were constantly taught in the Quran when we were kids about how, “We are God’s slaves, we are God’s slaves,” over and over again. I remember we were also constantly told this quote, “You know not, but God knows… you know not, but God knows… you know not, but God knows” <a href="https://quran.com/2/216" rel="external nofollow">which is from a very famous passage in the Quran.</a> So when the Muslim liberal asks something like “why do we persecute gays?” all you have to do is to quote the Quran: “You know not, but God knows.” It’s basically telling the spiritually inferior people: “Hey, just shut the fuck up and obey your superiors.” This stems the tide of degeneracy, at least for a while. Meanwhile, you guys have to write <a href="http://ropeculture.org/2016/03/01/the-fag-agenda/" rel="external nofollow">gigantic articles</a> even to your very own crowd of right-wingers just to teach them why poofters are sinful.
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, so my objection here is that the idea of free will leads to exoteric individualism, and from there you know the rest of the story. That’s why this attitude that free will exists is definitely harmful to society at the very least (which is not to say that it is <em>esoterically</em> false, but at least <em>exoterically</em> it is definitely harmful).
</p>

<p>
	But then, even esoterically, let’s forget about Islam and Christianity for a second and let’s just focus on what Tradition says. The way I’m thinking about it… what is the ultimate goal of the Traditional sciences? Be it alchemy, astrology, yoga, whatever… the ultimate goal is the same thing: to reach God and become one with Him. Or you could say: to awaken the inner Self. And as we know from Hinduism, my Self is the same as your Self, because if awakened they’ll both be manifestations of God’s Will, and God’s Will is One. So if the highest Will is God’s Will, and if the purpose of life is to awaken that one Will, then obviously everything below that one Will is degenerate and it must be purged. So even if free will exists, it is degenerate and it shouldn’t exist. And since everything will ultimately succumb to God’s Will at the end anyway, that means free will didn’t exist in the first place. And finally, when this esoteric philosophy is exoterically manifested into our own lives, it means that our purpose is to kill whatever little free will of our own we have, and to just become living manifestations of God’s Will—to become possessed by Him.
</p>

<p>
	What do you think?

			So, when we are talking about Truth and falsehood, we are seeing a duality, and to a point this view can be justified - you are right about that there is no third way here, as something between Truth and falsehood would be still false. But why is that? (Hint: think about their nature.)

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Nice test!
</p>

<p>
	So, this test led me down the following thought process:
</p>

<p>
	First, it reminded me of the conversation we had earlier about how feminism is evil not just because it opposes the solar/lunar essence of the two genders, but because it also tries to assert that this solar/lunar essence doesn’t even exist in the first place. In other words, it tries to attack the whole framework from below and basically claims that there is no framework to begin with, that the framework doesn’t even exist. (It’s similar to how love and hatred are a duality that are reconciled into a trinity. But love and apathy are not a duality that can be reconciled.)
</p>

<p>
	Second, it reminded me of the issue of quality vs quantity. The highest truth has the highest quality with the lowest quantity, whereas the lowest falsehood has the highest quantity with the lowest quality. “Truth is one; falsehood is infinite.” Therefore, the dualities that are reconciled are those that lead us toward higher quality in the direction of the One Truth, and the ones that irreconcilable are those that lead us toward lower quality in the direction of infinite falsehoods. And thus the highest Truth cannot be unified with the lowest falsehood, because this is not a horizontal relationship between dual qualities, but rather it is a vertical relationship between a singular quality versus multitudes of false quantities.
</p>

<p>
	So how did I do? Is this right? :D
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Hmm, actually, I think this is a separate hierarchy compared to the one I was thinking of. The seven Sufi stages you mention here seem to be more in line with the Seven Seals of Revelation/Seven Alchemical Elements/Seven Chakras/Seven Days/etc. What I was thinking about was another hierarchy, a trinity between the body and mind and soul (salt, mercury, and sulphur) which is later transformed into the trinity between body and soul and Spirit (the Self).
</p>

<p>
	From what I’ve picked up on the topic, one thing that’s for sure is that all the various hierarchies (the 12s, the 7s, the 4s, etc) are ultimately reconciled into Two (solar and lunar), and then that Two is finally unified into One, and that One is God (the Self/Vishnu). So those Seven Sufi stages are most likely re-combined into 4, and that 4 becomes 2, and that becomes a Trinity, whose pinnacle is of course One, and that One is God.
</p>

<p>
	This also makes sense from the pagan perspective too. All the pagan gods are in an alchemical/astrological Hierarchy, with the lower gods just being smaller fragments taken out of the greater gods. These fragments can then be combined all the way until the highest duality (Brahma vs Shiva) which culminates in the One Supreme God (Vishnu) who contains all the other fragments inside Him. This is what the ancient Pagans meant when they talked about "the imitation of the gods."
</p>

<p>
	It also makes sense from the Christian perspective as well, since you could apply the same idea to the Christian Trinity, and from there on you’ll end up with the One as well. (It’s interesting, by the way, that we already seem to be discussing the very highest steps of spirituality here, even though we’re quite lost and we’re not sure exactly where we are right now. Of course, it’s necessary to first know where we’ll be going—i.e. the thread of Ariadne!—and then we’ll be able to see where we are now. But then again, this still seems to be the big problem for most of us… just, where are we right now? We know that we will end at One, and we’re obviously not at the Chaotic beginning, but how far along the process are we exactly? Are we at 12? At 7? At 666? This is why we need genuine initiation centers ffs. God, I hate the modern world.)

	Wow, that passage was so great! It contains so much truth, and it sums up the whole issue so neatly. I’ve read about the difference between these two paths in so many books, but it all makes so much sense when you put it this way. It actually reminds me of a diagram at the beginning of John Dee’s Monas Hieroglyphica, which shows two paths—one ending in the person becoming a Tyrant (which in this conversation would mean Occultism), while the other ends in him becoming Spiritual (which would be Transcendence). I’m pretty sure you’re referring to the same thing here, although John Dee then goes on to elaborate on it and takes it further. Check it out if you haven’t yet.
</p>

<p>
	Also, I want to mention that Savitri Devi talks about the same thing in A Son of God, when she talks about Akhenaten’s realization about how few people truly understood what he was preaching. The plebs didn’t understand Truth, and if he were to force them to understand, it wouldn’t mean anything anyway—just another religion spread by force, which would eventually decline and die out like all the others. So he abandoned the project (of Occultism) and headed straight for Transcendence.
</p>

<p>
	One thing though: would it not be possible to follow both of those two paths? Again, this is probably due to our different cultural backgrounds, but this separation you mention between Transcendence and Occultism reeks of the separation between church and state. Could it not be said that someone like Mohammad achieved both Transcendence and Occultism as well? Mohammad obviously achieved the end goal of Occultism (reigning over the mountain), so this means that he either didn’t achieve Transcendence or he achieved both of them at the same time. I’d say Mohammad achieved both, and in fact the more I’ve studied the Mohammedan revolution (if you could call it that), the more I’ve realized it truly boggles the mind how Mohammad did what he did. But again, you could certainly argue that Mohammad didn’t achieve Transcendence after all, though you can’t argue that he didn’t achieve the end goal of Occultism. So either a) he achieved both of them, or b) he only achieved the Occult. Which do you think?

<p>
	Interestingly enough, since we’re on the topic of intuition, it reminded me of something I read about Ungern Khan, where people described how his sense of intuition was so naturally powerful that he could immediately read through people, recognize traitors from loyal followers, understand what he has to do, and so on. It also reminds me of a passage I read about Codreanu, where he’s described like he looked as if he were out of this world, like he wasn’t even human but was instead more like a physical manifestation of the Carpathians and the rivers and mountains of the land. And really, when you think about it, that’s the whole purpose of the esoteric sciences. That’s the whole purpose of initiation: to turn us into such men. And that itself can only be done with our own willpower and our own awakening of our inner intuition/inner Self. And during this process the masters must only help the students along but they must never give us the answers openly, since that would ruin our awakening process.

	Beautiful. That’s exactly what I’m thinking too. We need fascist monasteries (they don’t have to be literal mountain monasteries of course, though they could be, since that would literally fit perfectly with the Earth metaphor you mentioned; but anyway, I mean it more in a figurative sense, where we have monastic-like communities in both the cities and the rural areas too). And the initiation centers have to really study the esoteric sciences, since that’s the most important factor for keeping our spirits as pure as possible. Are any of the various groups affiliated with IM doing this btw? I’m pretty sure AW isn’t, and I don’t think <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> was doing it either, and obviously the Trad retards wouldn’t do this in a million years. Man, we’re so lost… we live in such an abandoned world. But of course, this also means that we can and we have to take matters into our own hands. Personally, I have to geek out and say I can’t wait until this dream comes true! Just imagining it drives me insane. It will seriously be the most beautiful thing in the world, and it will be absolutely necessary because no genuinely fascist group can survive without this fanatical religious fervor.

			I read somewhere that there is a disagreement within the Alchemists over the hierarchy of the four elements: some says Air is on the top, others are saying it is Fire (I tend to support the latter)
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Very interesting. I’m actually curious why you think so, because this is something that I’ve been wondering about too. It’s a very curious problem. From what I’ve so far read, the impression I’ve gotten is that (at least in alchemy) Air is on top of Fire. After all, the Four Elements also correspond to the Four Castes, and Fire naturally corresponds to the Kshatriya caste, whereas Air corresponds to the Brahmin caste. Also, I remember reading in Guenon’s Studies in Hinduism (chapter 4) where he lists the five elements as follows: ether —&gt; wind —&gt; fire —&gt; water —&gt; earth. He says near the end of the chapter: “For colour is a quality of fire, and fire is logically later than air in the order of the development of the five elements; this quality is still not, therefore, manifested at the stage represented by air.” So I’m inclined to think, at least when it comes to alchemy alone by itself, that Air seems to be above Fire.
</p>

<p>
	But yes, it’s true, I’ve had a tough time reconciling the different texts I have been meditating on. Some of them put Air on top and some others do indeed put Fire on top. My current “theory,” by the way, is that this disagreement over Air and Fire stems from a confusion between Alchemy and Astrology. That’s my theory so far. I think that somewhere along the line, the alchemists and astrologists (due to the inevitable degradation of both disciplines) got entangled in the different areas of their differing fields, and that’s where this confusion came about. My idea is that in alchemy, Air is on top because alchemists are lower than astrologists in the hierarchy of sciences and therefore need to approach God by “becoming less material, more heaven-like” so to speak. Meanwhile, astrologists are the opposite: they’re higher than alchemists and that’s why they need Fire in order to “get back down to earth” (metaphorically speaking). A merchant’s penultimate step before reaching God may be through meditation and sacred solitude, whereas a monk’s penultimate step may be through earthly and physical tasks.
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, that’s just my own speculation so far and I don’t have anything to confirm it (zero proof, and in fact it could be totally wrong), although of course I’ll keep searching. But yeah, I’m very curious to hear your thoughts on that discrepancy.

<p>
	Very true. It’s similar to what Baranyi talks about in his article you sent where he mentions the two forces pulling us apart—the body pulling us down versus the spirit pulling us up. Certainly, as the decline continues, we have to do our duty to God and be among the saved once the world ends. Whether it is in the earth or under the abyss or wherever, involution will press on ahead all the way until the apocalypse. We’re basically the few ones who for some reason have said no to all of that, and who still yearn for the bliss of the Heaven that is above this dying world. We already know that Truth will triumph at the end. Regardless of what happens, obviously at the end of history, Truth will triumph, even if you or I or all fascists just sat down and did nothing whatsoever. God will still triumph. But even knowing this, we still have to do the right thing, because internally our inner spirits really aren’t of this age. We just don’t belong here, you know. Our souls don’t belong in this world, and that’s why even instinctively we’re so disgusted by it, and we yearn to build a bit of that transcendent Heaven on this lowly realm.

			Yes, that's why I still can't drop the idea of 'Integralism' in the sense that we will never be able to turn everybody into Fascists, but maybe we will be able to build them into the structure of the Fascist society. For this we need one-way connections, just as it was in the Traditional societies: since the king was following God, the nobles were following the king, and the plebs were following the nobles, everybody was following God only on different levels of directness. Corruption changes the way of these connections so it is no more the superior what influences the inferior, but the other way around. Our task is to contain Chaos within Order, and slowly assimilate it. Today the opposite is happening, and if there is no more chance for us to change the direction of the influences running through those connections, we have no choice but to cut them - so it's either Integralism or Isolation, but it is indisputable that the realization of the former is becoming more and more close to the impossible.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yeah, I agree with everything you say here. It also reminds me of the society that Plato describes in the Politeia. Obviously they had a much easier time during the eras of Plato and Alexander, but the same principles still apply, except now the spiritual divide between the Guardians and the plebs is becoming so extreme that our job is becoming harder and harder. But also, in another way, I can’t help but think—isn’t it becoming easier as well? The way I think about it, I’d say the masses are becoming so weak that they can fall for anything. I’d say that, given a sufficiently powerful propaganda machine, integralism is still very much possible. In a sense it’s harder but in another sense it’s easier. It’s harder because the plebs are weaker than before and therefore don’t understand us as much, but also it’s easier because they’re becoming so weak that we can just brainwash people much more easily. What do you think about that?
</p>

<p>
	Another thing I’m thinking about is that in the ideal scenario we could have both Integralism and Isolation together, creating a societal structure where the masses are streamlined toward God while also simultaneously creating fascist initiation centers that exist outside the society and could (and must) survive without them. And I don’t just mean this in an esoteric/exoteric sense, but in a sense where the initiation centers are totally outside the society. Wouldn’t this achieve both goals, with Integralism and Isolation combined together?

<p>
	I'm familiar with the references to Egypt and Antarctica, and I also remember Baranyi mentioning this in relation to the Spiritual Earth being flat as opposed to the physical earth being spherical (which is another interesting topic all on its own). What I don’t get though is how this explains the corruption of the Boreans by the Tropicals. Are you saying that because the Boreans conquered the Tropicals, they’re becoming corrupted by them—but meanwhile Eastern Europe and the Middle East didn’t conquer the Tropicals as much, and so they haven’t been corrupted by them to the same extent as the Boreans? Is that what you mean?
</p>

<p>
	Or are you saying that it’s simply because the Northeast is geographically further away from the Southwest than either the North or Northwest?
</p>

<p>
	Also, where does that put the original Aryans’ location? I always believed they came from Scandinavia/the North Pole, but if it’s the northeast, then wouldn’t that mean they’re close to the Urals?
</p>

<p>
	But yes, I agree with you that the Middle East and Eastern Europe will soon become as degenerate as Western Europe and North America. It’s just a matter of time.

<p>
	Oh yeah, Kurds are actually pretty obsessed with Mackinder’s Heartland theory. Among many Kurds there’s this idea that Mackinder’s Heartland has its outer boundaries expanding toward the center of Kurdistan, and that Kurdistan’s separation plays a geopolitical role similar to the separation of the Koreas, but on a more dramatic level because here it’s the fault-line between Iran and Turkey, thus acting as an extension of the larger fault line between Europe and Asia.
</p>

<p>
	Although, now that I’m an Iranian nationalist, I can see the Mackinder Heartland affecting Iran even more, and in fact I’m now worried Iran could even become the place where the geopolitical battle lines are drawn in the future. One interesting fact that people have noted is that since the start of the 2000s alone, the US has placed multidivisional forces precisely on each side of Iran’s land borders (Afghanistan and Iraq). Makes you think where this is all headed.

	Oh, come on, you're being way too nice. She is quite disgusting. I bet she probably didn’t do that much real combat anyway, and she’s most likely just bragging about it to score some points. This is what I mean by Kurdish nationalism being a tool of the devil. Instinctively all Kurds understand that in order for Kurdistan to be independent, there’s really only one way to do so: by spreading degeneracy throughout the Middle East. That’s what the whole philosophy of the PKK/YPG boils down to: spreading liberalism/feminism/communism so that the Middle East becomes so weak that an independent Kurdistan could finally be feasible. In other words, they don’t want to improve themselves, but rather they want to worsen others. Even if she’s not aware of it on an intentional level, instinctively that is the route that people like her are following. And ultimately, the sad thing is that they are right. They’re actually right—if you follow Kurdish nationalism to its final conclusion, that’s what you’ll have to do. I eventually had to admit to myself that this is what Kurdish nationalism boils down to, and so I abandoned it.

			Hard to tell for it is true that the longer lifetime is frequently occurring in Traditional sources, but it is also possible that this had a more symbolic meaning. I remember when Baranyi funnily quoted one of these texts showing us how worried they were about the tragic nature of the Iron Age for in this era the humans have lost their ability to live longer than <em>a millennium</em>. Today it is common that people feel like they are stagnating and time flows out of their hands, so one can argue that the ancient ones maybe lived just as long as we do, but their life was much more intense.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Hmm, yeah, I’m not sure about this either. The way I’m thinking about it… I’d say that if you take the concept of spiritual warfare to its final conclusion, it should go like this from the bottom to the top: outer world changes inner world —&gt; outer world can no longer change inner world —&gt; inner world can now change outer world —&gt; inner world changes outer world.
</p>

<p>
	So if the most degenerate person is someone who is addicted to the smallest bodily/physical desires (like porn and cigarettes and fast food and so on), then the total opposite of this would be someone whose inner soul is not only unaffected by bodily/physical changes, but instead his inner soul "explodes" outward and changes the bodily/physical/outer world itself. Think of a Shaolin monk, but then imagine something far more extreme than that. And by the way, this also takes us into the theories about Jesus and Moses and Krishna and so on, regarding their magical abilities and their miracles. If the theories are true about Jesus and Moses being the last members of some mystical/magical Aryan bloodline that has now died out, it wouldn’t be too far-fetched to say that Jesus did indeed turn water into wine and He did walk on water and perhaps even He came back to life too. Actually, now that I’ve mentioned this, I want to hear your thoughts on that. Do you reckon that Jesus did actually, literally, come back to life and did walk on water and everything? Because again, these two topics (magical ancient Aryans + the magic done by the likes of Jesus and Moses) pretty much complete each other. One leads to the other, and vice versa. If one is true, the other is true too.
</p>

<p>
	(Also, since we’re on the topic, I wanted to ask what your thoughts were on the Gnostic Gospels. What do you think about the Gospel of Thomas for example? I read it the other day and I believe it’s pretty accurate. If the Gospel of Thomas is true, then Jesus was basically teaching Hermeticism to His followers.)
</p>

<p>
	Now, my initial inclination (I’m 60% sure) is that the magic is indeed all true, and that the ancient Aryans were possibly even extraterrestrial aliens that came from other planets and colonized Hyperborea, and that the likes of Jesus were the final descendants of these Nordic aliens. Again, this stuff sounds utterly nuts and totally bonkers from a modernist mindset, but we can’t discard these ideas completely. In fact, this is key to understanding Fascism and Tradition. Hell, this magical mindset/lifestyle could be the very key that’s been missing from modern fascist movements. But in order to actually apply it to ourselves, we have to truly understand and genuinely admit to the full implications and conclusions that this mindset leads to, and then we will be able to actually try to apply and implement them. What do you think?

	Before I get into this, I just wanted to ask you… have you checked out Fulcanelli’s supposed life story? I mean… the thing sounds out of this world. Something that’s really surprising is that it’s very recent too—hell, it happened right around the time of WWII even. In fact, while I was reading about Fulcanelli, I could only think about how some of Fulcanelli’s students might still be alive. To this very day! Isn’t that crazy? And also, I even read some theories that Fulcanelli could have been 100 or 200 years by the time he wrote the book, and that just made me think like… wait a second… what am I reading? I don’t know. What are your thoughts on that?
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, I loved reading the Mystery of the Cathedrals. It’s one of <em>the</em> best books I’ve ever read. But it also requires hard work to get through, which I wasn’t expecting at all before I began reading. But then immediately from the beginning it became clear that this is not a book where you can shut your mind and read it at ease. It’s more like the older alchemical treatises where you really have to focus on what it’s saying and immerse yourself in every word and sentence and symbol. I know that I’m going to reread the book again and again, because so much information is contained in there and you have to really examine all the external sources and various authors it mentions in order to get the full picture. I actually want us to have a big conversation just on this book itself, because it truly is precious, although I’m not sure how we’d go about doing it. Do you think IM as a whole would be interested in reading through it? (Like the “Let’s read SIEGE” threads for example?)
</p>

<p>
	Another thing, I have to say: one thing that Fulcanelli did explicitly confirm (and which I’ve been suspecting for a while) is that the Luciferian element is the first step toward reaching Truth. That’s the famous first step, the beginning of the journey from which everything else arises. I always suspected that this was the case, but Fulcanelli just comes right out and confirms it. It’s true—the first step toward God is the Luciferian seed (and by the way, that is something that all of us fascists have). I was actually surprised that Fulcanelli said it so openly, but there it is.
</p>

<p>
	(Also, damn… now I want to go on a pilgrimage throughout all of France and check out all the places and little corners and details that Fulcanelli mentions. That would be so amazing, and it would make the book even more magical, since I kept searching online and a lot of the small details that Fulc mentions don’t seem to have any photos taken of them.)
</p>

<p>
	I haven’t yet finished Coomaraswamy’s book though, but I did read through much of the Quadralectic blog. The blog was immediately reminiscent of the predominance of 4s in so many different topics (4 castes, 4 elements, 4 humors, etc), and now we have 4 corners as well. His frequent description of the quadrants (invisible invisibility, invisible visibility, etc) corresponds to traditional descriptions of the elements as well (hot, cold, etc). The guy’s knowledge seems excellent and there’s a ton to learn from him. Hell, I loved it so much every time he gave his own fresh take on familiar buildings that I had studied before in my architecture classes, and he pointed out things about those buildings that my materialistic architecture professor never even noticed. I’m currently reading my way through chapter 7 and I have to say that this one is definitely the best chapter. What are your thoughts on the blog so far?
</p>

<p>
	And as for my favorite styles:
</p>

<p>
	Of course, I’ve always considered Gothic architecture to be the pinnacle of any architectural style ever devised. By far my absolute favorite. With the monumental verticality and angularity and sharpness, with the upward focus toward God, and with the intimate intricacy and subtle play on light and dark, Gothic architecture creates the most powerful atmosphere of mysticism I’ve seen in any style.
</p>

<p>
	After that, my second favorite is <a href="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1679952/images/o-MOSQUE-facebook.jpg" rel="external nofollow">Iranian architecture</a>. Notice by the way that both Gothic and Iranian architecture capture the same <a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/Guest-Posts/i-wMSKjtB/0/X2/iran-cultural-tour-9-X2.jpg" rel="external nofollow">mystical/otherworldly feeling</a>, which I don’t think any other architectural styles do as well as those two do it.

	My third favorite is rather unconventional compared to the others: Art Deco. I say, if you’re going to build skyscrapers, build them in the Art Deco style—or at least something similar to it. It’s so bold, so detailed, and it uses such powerful colors. It’s the only modern style I don’t hate.
</p>

<p>
	And after that I’d say Byzantine architecture is the next best one, followed by classical Greco-Roman architecture, followed by the pyramidic architecture of many <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/27/63590545_86dd9fb0bc_b.jpg" rel="external nofollow">Hindu temples</a>, and finally in last place we have the Chinese pagodas which also have their own particular charm as well.
</p>

<p>
	What about your favorite styles?

	Oh, hahaha, I can’t believe I forgot you were related to Asia. Actually, now that I think about it, honestly the real reason is that I’ve never "instinctively" considered Hungarians to be related to Asia. Whenever I see them, I just think, “Yup, they’re a bunch of Europeans.” And that’s why when I wrote “mongols” in there, I was thinking of Turks and Mongolians and Tatars, but Hungary never even crossed my mind. Interesting how that works on a subconscious level. On a logical level I can see all the stuff about Hungary's history and Pan-Turanism and so on, but on an instinctive level I consider Hungarians to just be average Europeans. And of course, by blood most Hungarians are indeed just European, although by spirit and by language you could say it’s a different matter.
</p>

<p>
	By the way, where do you see Hungary being when it comes to the supranationalist geopolitical view? An ally of Russia/Eastern Europe? An ally of Germany/Northern Europe? An ally of Rome/Catholicism? An ally of Turkey/Pan-Turanism?

	Yeah, as you know, I’ve changed my mind completely on that topic. I agree with you now.

	Alright, so I’ve watched the Dugin videos and read a few of his articles. I think I have a good idea of what he’s about now. I have to say, his criticism of modernity is excellent, and I understand (and agree with) the world of Daseins that he envisions. But he also comes to too many wrong conclusions. Or at least, the way he expresses his ideas makes it seem like that. I remember one thing that he was constantly saying, for example, was that “We have no individual. We have no class. We have no race.” And as I was listening to that, it made me think… Uh, but Mr. Dugin, we do have all of those…
</p>

<p>
	We have individuals, not in the liberal sense of individualism, but in the sense of great heroes and powerful personalities. Of course the masses have no personality, and encouraging individualism for them is disastrous, but the elite do have individuality, and that’s the whole point of inequality in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	We also do have class, not in the modern capitalist sense, but in the Traditional caste system of a hierarchy where each person finds his place inside the hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
	And clearly we do have race—that’s the most obvious one. Of course, Dugin is right about returning to the solar and traditional Europe, but race is a very important part of that. Dugin is just being too disingenuous when he dismisses race. He can’t reject race like this. Even Evola didn’t reject race like this. (Of course, I agree with Dugin’s rejection of nationalistic chauvinism though. But the things he says about race are too wrong. Unless he heavily clarifies his statements further, what he’s saying now is basically just support for race-mixing and miscegenation.)
</p>

<p>
	And you know, this is what I mentioned earlier about Dugin being untrustworthy—he seems like he knows the truth and he does carry a great deal of truth in what he says in general, but then he suddenly says things that are suspicious as hell and it takes you aback. Overall, the sense I get from him is that he’s just a mouthpiece for Putin, and his whole “4PT” and “multipolarity” schtick doesn’t stem from genuine belief, but instead it’s just an elaborate excuse for Russia to have a modern version of the Soviet Union. Nothing wrong with Russia being stronger of course, but Dugin obviously seems to be trying to “slide that in” rather than being upfront about it. Basically, he’s not honest.
</p>

<p>
	You mentioned earlier that his conception is fascist on the inside but more compromising on the outside for the sake of integralism. I’d say that he compromises way too much, and that the compromises he makes will only lead to our internal spiritual weakening. Why make external compromises for the sake of integralism, when we can instead become stronger on the inside and achieve integralism that way? I say, the external compromises he makes can be compensated for if we increase our internal spritual strength, which his compromises would only weaken.
</p>

<p>
	But again, I absolutely agree with his conception of Dasein though. That much is very true—that different regions/civilizations have their own inner sense of existence, and it’s that inner essence that has to be cultivated in order to achieve the earthly ideal. North America has its own Dasein, China has its Dasein, Iran has its Dasein, Russia has its Dasein, etc. All of that is true of course.

	Thank you so much, Vas. You’ve been such a great help all along the way. I don’t think I would have gotten here without you. I mean that with total sincerity.
