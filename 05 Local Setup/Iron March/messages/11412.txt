<p>Huh oh well this is my account now I have been reincarnated from the lunar to the solar form. plus the comments on that blog are correct you need a graduate work and muesuem training which is a whole nother barrel of shit to get into before you work. Lel I remember my senior year of highschool was fun and depressing because we all didn't know wtf we were doing the college I went to took a picture of the group and my friends were like you look like you were going to kill yourself and it was funny because thats exactly what I felt like when the picture was taken I had my head in my hands lol.</p>
