<p>When I first came here I mostly just had a hardcore hatred for Muslims and sand people in general but this place redpilled me hard. I still love my Jewish side because they're family but it still weirds me out seeing Hebrew throughout the houses and my grandma telling me to always vote democrat no matter who it is. </p>
<p>My scot grandfather died when my dad was 16. Both grandmothers are still alive though.</p>
