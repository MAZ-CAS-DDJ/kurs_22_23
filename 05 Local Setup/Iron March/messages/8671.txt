<p>I noticed a Creativity reverend speaking at the WMM and was impressed. I saw today a few Creativity stickers in my home town too. Whilst all they said was 'are you proud to be white?' unscrupulous individuals had attempted to tear them off, with minimal success.</p>
<p>My question is, why the sudden re emergence of the movement? You seem, from an outside perspective at least, much more active as of late</p>
