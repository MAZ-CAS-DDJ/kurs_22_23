<p>Well in the thread Slavros and I discussed the difference between physical remains of the Hyperboreans versus them being a spiritual race basically first we had to figure out how Evola refuted the concept of evolution and came to involution while keeping the actual scientific theory of evolution. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Basically start researching the oldest archaeology from areas around northern Europe, northern Asia and look for things that connect with the myths of the various cultures that Evola mentions. Basically according to Evola every myth has some part of the truth in it about the Hyperboreans, that being said it might be incredibly hard to find because it may have occurred so long ago and after a cataclysmic event that nothing would be left to find. </p>

<p>I started at least here</p>
