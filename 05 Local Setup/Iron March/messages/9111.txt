<p>Congrats on gaining modship. I was wondering how you were able to have yourself as a friend on the forum.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, it may have been the result of one of my errors when I was restoring your account from the forum database (I told Slavros what to do). It's a minor annoyance, but I do want to correct it if that's the case.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don't know how I "befriended" myself either. It really was of no consequence. I didn't get a chance to thank you for your effort though, so thanks again.</p>
