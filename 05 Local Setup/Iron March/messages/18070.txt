	Zaxon No, I am not, but thanks for asking.  The Order of Odalists is learning the art of Video Blogging right now, We have several kinsman that must pull their weight, so it will be much more enjoyable.   Personally I did run American Thought Criminal for a short period of time. So you can get a face, I will include a link.  But as far as the Odalist. It is still in the making, as I was not happy with what I produced and I need a much better quality show.  This is all I have ever done on Youtube.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNaBUneERrRs2wRTBhcFBg" rel="external nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNaBUneERrRs2wRTBhcFBg</a>
