	I'm 28. I've been pretty radical since highschool. Our town was basically half white and half spic. And I'll tell you, I've never met a more despicable and vile group of scum than mexicans. I hate them and I will go down to the border and start laying fucking bricks for Trump myself if I have to. I want them all gone.
