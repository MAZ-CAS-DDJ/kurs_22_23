<p>Thank you <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> it is a nice shirt, very comfortable.</p>
<p>I'm really sorry to hear that. Are you all better now? Food poisoning is very unpleasant, I got it badly at 4 yrs old from burger king and never went to fast food ever again.</p>
<p>I had such a great time this weekend, on the road now sadly. I went on the beach a lot, went surfing and hiking too. We met some Afrikaners and they were really cool guys, I got to talk about SA history and use my limited Afrikaans vocabulary. They had two little kids and the younger one was the most beautiful little blond angel girl I've ever met. </p>
<p>And needless to say I thought about you a lot.</p>
<p>Even wrote a poem about it.</p>
<blockquote class="ipsStyle_spoiler">
<p>And the sun does fade into trees</p>
<p>At the end of a day in action.</p>
<p>And the flame does fade into dreams</p>
<p>Like cool smoke hugging the marshes</p>
<p>That border these ancient dunes</p>
<p>With grasses and croaking frogs.</p>
<p>And that primordial sound reverberates</p>
<p>Dulling my head like fine wine.</p>
<p>And I think of you once more</p>
<p>To add one to countless times</p>
<p>So the smoke of dreams takes shape</p>
<p>That I feel a caress never felt and smell never smelt.</p>
<p>And the flame relights inside</p>
<p>So I find your holy vector by compass</p>
<p>And pray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope you are having a lovely father's day.</p>
