<p>i read your introduction thread, and wanted to ask a few questions if you don't mind? before i do so, i'd like to say that i'm a 15 year old national socialist as well, although from a different country. </p>
<p>question 1: do you consider yourself a fascist or do you consider national socialism to be a fascist system, or do you think it is it's own system?</p>
<p>question 2: you said you are an agnostic, just out of curiosity, have you ever researched nazi occultism or Neitzsche philosophy? </p>
<p>question 3: what economic system do you advocate for?</p>
<p>thank you for your time, i hope to hear your response soon. </p>
