<p>Hello, didn't Ben Noyles tell you? Cool down period of 48 hours.</p>
<p>It is completely impossible to list in the Charter every single situation that could lead to a temporary or permanent ban. Those things are usually discussed on a case to case basis.</p>
<p>Best, WiB</p>

<p>I appreciate that, but I have been banned now for about 58 hours, I should have had my account back earlier today.</p>
<p>Thanks, Ben Barton.</p>
