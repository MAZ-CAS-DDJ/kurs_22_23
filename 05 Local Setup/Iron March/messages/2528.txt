<p>Sorry, I a replied privately to De Lowe out of sheer fear that I would bring the wrath of those I would deem trolls upon me.  I don't prefer German Nationalism to Swedish Nationalism because I don't view them as mutually exclusive. Now if you are asking if I have an affinity for the Third Reich for instance, then yes I would say that I do.</p>
