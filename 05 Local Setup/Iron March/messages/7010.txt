<p>Yeah, I was following the results that day, your club lost. I'm a fan of Mura from Murska Sobota, a club from eastern region of Slovenia where my ancestry is from. My father and grandfather played for that club and I support it even though I was born in capital Ljubljana and lived here all my life, Mura is simply in my blood. The region from where Mura is from is the most fanatical as far as football is concerned and we're the 3rd most supported club in the country even though the town of Murska Sobota has only 12.000 inhabitants. When we were in first division we had 2000-3000 average attendance. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7GYiAAQEIw" rel="external nofollow">This</a> is how our stadium looked in summer of 2011, when we returned to first league and faced our rival from neighbouring town (FC Nafta Lendava). We had a small ultras group (50-100 people) but we were all crazy, I left in 2012 when most of my friends left because of infighting.</p>

<p>I have some good memories though. Here's one story I can back up with video material: Back in the 2nd division we developed a rivalry with some random club from the southern party of our country. We went to an away game with them, totally drunk and we were cheering our team like crazy, even <a href="http://youtu.be/6QuP65GqYhc" rel="external nofollow">during half time break</a>. Local ultras provoked us during whole match. After the game we wanted to attack them, it was only like 15 of us, we jumped over the fence but they didn't respond. We ended up fighting with their players lol, it was a mess, good fight.. So 1 year later we play against them again, this time at home. It was a boring game, half of our crew was missing, their fans didn't even show up, as expected. We smuggled a lot of wine on the stadium and some of us were really drunk. The referee was horrible, biased towards us (at least so I heard - I wasn't paying much attention to the game), gave a penalty to them in the last minute. So after the game we jumped on the pitch and attacked the refs, even the linesman who did nothing wrong got beat up (lol). <a href="http://youtu.be/jv25sG4K9gU" rel="external nofollow">Here's</a> a video of this incident, as you can see, their players (in green shirts) were running faster than the referees because they remembered us very well from the fight we had with them one year earlier. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> I didn't have a chance to punch the ref though, I slipped in the middle of the field (like Gerrard haha) and me and my friend had to fought off a steward. Our goalkeeper came to us and said "don't do this guys" but the irony is that it was his father who was like 60+ years old who jumped on the pitch and delivered the final blow to the ref, broke his zygomatic bone, so our GK turns around and sees this and he's like "dad, what are you doing?" <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> I'm on the video at 0:47, running from the left. I was totally crazy back then, 18 years old, I would do anything.</p>

<p>Most of our stupid incidents weren't covered by videos or pictures unfortunately, it was a great time though. I think these hooligan groups are like the modern society's test of manliness. I'm from a respectable family and we were always well off, if I weren't introduced to hooligan and skinhead scene I would probably be just some regular right winger. Let me put it this way, if every single "future intellectual" student from a middle class background went through what I have went through they wouldn't be such pussies and would be attracted to fascism much more. If you want to be a man you simply have to have some street smarts and experiences to handle yourself in all sorts of situations.</p>

<p>You're right, this forum actually values this sort of thinking, while on most far-right forums they just want to copy bourgeois elitism (even though this type of elitism is now almost exclusively leftist - they just want to construct some far-right version of it, which will never happen in current circumstances). That's why I gradually came to like it. At first I was trolling a bit as a response to some views I didn't like, but now I agree 100% that it has much more potential than any other far-right forum so far. I'd just wish there were more people from continental Europe who I can relate to more.</p>

<p>You and me, we both had genuine paths to fascism. I recognized this after reading your posts. We're the cool guys who genuinely love our homelands and after you're "redpilled" bit by bit you simply can't let it go, even though it leads you on a one-way to trouble of all sorts. I really like your posts too, in fact I've reconsidered my views of Hitler after reading them. We're both genuinely interested in the truth. You see, I've been involved in neo-NS scene since my teens and I would NEVER leave my comrades no matter what, but on a personal level I rejected Hitler and his views at one point. Lately, I've come to accept him once again.</p>

<p>I think my Catholicism has been misunderstood a bit. My friend made a nice collection of how Catholic-<em>fascist</em> aesthetics of our country looked like before Bolshevik revolution in 1945: <a href="http://legija-ahaca.tumblr.com/" rel="external nofollow">http://legija-ahaca.tumblr.com/</a> A lot of pagans are against the Church, but looking at those pics you can clearly see the pagan vibe that the Church has preserved through adopting so much of paganism. This has been supressed by protestantism but has survived in catholicism. The icons, the shrines, the processions, the saints... On the pics there are also images from Hasburg past (banner with Christ is from a famous battle against Turks) and images of deeply Catholic  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_Home_Guard" rel="external nofollow">Slovene Home Guard units</a>, our warrriors who collaborated with the Nazis against the Bolsheviks. This is the heritage I love and which was destroyed by bolsheviks in 1945.</p>
