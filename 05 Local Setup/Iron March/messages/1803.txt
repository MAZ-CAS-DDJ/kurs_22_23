<p>Greetings, Ms. WiB.</p>
<p>If you do not mind me asking, is there something wrong? I've seen that you've removed even your display picture.</p>
<p>It'd be a shame for Iron March to lose someone like you. We need more common sense around here and, from what I've seen, you have always brought it.</p>
<p>I've noticed that some users have no respect for people such as you and William and, in my opinion, that's a shame. But, as selfish as it may sound, people like you are needed on this place to keep a balance.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>
<p>TvE</p>
