	It would be more practical and efficient for the sake of bureaucracy,time zones and brevity that Australians should have their own IM Chapter. As far as I know, there isn't any active political group in Australia named Australian Action, which would be a great name for such an organisation. You could use the tactics and propaganda styles of Atomwaffen,Skydas,National Action and promote National Socialism in a good and effective manner.
