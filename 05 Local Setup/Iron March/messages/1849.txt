<p>As we discussed, the level of racism on this forum is absurd, and if you haven't seen yet, the thread about Brevik is full of widespread and overt support for a child killing maniac. I don't know about you, but I came to this forum to discuss Fascism and its various tenets intelligently, and most importantly develop the ideology for the modern world, as it is my personal opinion that most of it is out of date (and frankly either proven wrong or has become irrelevant) given its more than 60 years old. I was wondering if you wanted to discuss what we could do about trying to clean the forum up?</p>
