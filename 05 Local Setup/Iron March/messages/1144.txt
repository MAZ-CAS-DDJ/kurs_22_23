<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Here on Iron March, we lack of a thread on Nietzsche so my knowledge on his works is fairly low. As you seem to be a follower of his teachings, maybe you could help me understand his way of thinking. In my mind, he is a character wrapped in mystery but I'm really curious about to discover him.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
