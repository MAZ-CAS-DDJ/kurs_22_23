<p>I hope I did not scare you in introductions. I am half Jewish and I have had my Bar Mitzvah. I am also German, born in Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. I have had Jews in my family who were in the NSDAP and Hitler Jugend, interestingly. My German nationalism is because I do not want to be internationalist in my nationalism... As I do not live in Israel. I believe one should be nationalist to the nation of their home, unless they truly adopt another as is the case in colonialism... Or if I moved to Israel.</p>
<p>We will likely agree on almost everything, I just wanted to make a joke. Hopefully you have not confused me with a neonazi.</p>
