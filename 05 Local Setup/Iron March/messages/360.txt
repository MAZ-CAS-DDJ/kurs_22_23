<strong>The First Amendment to the Iron March Charter - </strong><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00"><em>We are not a White Nationalist hangout</em></span></strong><strong><span style="color:#FF8C00">!</span></strong><p>Our community is based on constructive discussion and debate<em>, it is not a hang out for</em><em> White Nationalists.</em> Remarks of that nature which do not have context is a form of spamming<em>.</em> <span style="text-decoration:underline">This community has absolutely no interest in your special culture or perpetuating it,</span> you have Stormfront and VNN forums for that. If you want to bring up legitimate issues, which are none the less, unpopular then we suggest you limit it to the Opposing Views section of our forum. The same applies for other ideologies that are not related to Fascism and other ideologies that oppose the Modern World. Failure to comply may result in <em>internment</em>, when a member's activity on the forum is restricted to the Opposing Views section. These members will be marked as <strong>Prisoners</strong>.</p>

<p>What this essentially means is that we are not interested in being propagated to and don't wish to have anyone spread their "culture" on our forum, i.e. the typical and unique aesthetics of the White Pride movement, such posts are as good as spam to us, however this <span style="text-decoration:underline">does not deny</span> people the opportunity to express a viewpoint that is on topic.</p>
<p>Rest assured, the Adminship does take action whenever anyone breaks the rules.</p>
