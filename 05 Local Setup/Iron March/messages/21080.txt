	Our discussion was fun but I can't say I'm not relieved now that they closed your intro (I was writing my last message for hours). You know pretty much on the topic of Catholicism, that's good. Lurk around some more, read the essentials, pass the exam and we can continue this talk. Or, you can write me here too (but I have a shitton of other stuff to do so it will take some time).
