<p>Ah, nevermind; I've simply found the free IM to be rather useful.</p>

<p>The TBG seminars were interesting, but ultimately I wasn't too impressed by the format. For a start, some of the speakers were unable to contextualise their topics in time and their 'tracks' were often highjacked by clotpoles who wished to stand upon their soapboxes, so to speak. There was a diverse array of people in attendence, but there were a few silver-haired antisemites who wished to moan about "The Jew" and Freemasonry all day. Not only this, but some of the BNP exiles such as Andrew Moffat and Andrew Brons turned up and used the opportunity to rather forcibly distribute their party literature. This is, ultimately, why I'm not a democrat. The conference was much more interesting as those who spoke were either specialists or experienced members of the nationalist sub-culture.</p>

<p>However, I'm more and more impressed by the youth of the Group. Those below the age of thirty are ultimately running the organisation and, from what they've told me, are usually anything but 'conservative'. They're either Traditionalists of an Evolian-delineation, New Right or seek a sort of synthesis between conservatism and the Continental tendencies. I was asked to write for the group last October and this offer was raised once again, I'll most likely take them up on it. I've decided to become a member purely because of the efforts and determination of the younger members and, of course, amor fati.</p>

<p>I didn't speak to John Morgan, although I sat through his 'track' which was ultimately a very brief introduction to the European New Right. It seems, however, that much of what he said went straight over the heads of the audience which, for whatever reason, began to ramble on about the need for Christian-revival. Indeed, one fellow who I spoke to, who I quickly determined to be a fellow-traveller of the Zionist-obsessed fringes, mentioned he wasn't too keen on Alain de Benoist's works. I managed to convince him to give Faye a chance and I believe he purchased a copy of 'Why We Fight'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In conclusion, until the Group descended to a nearby pub and I was able to speak to the younger members, I felt pretty alienated and despondent. The quality of the Group is diminished by some of the pond-life it attracts. I don't say this out of snobbery, not at all, it just seems that conspiracy-theories, lame suggestions of the prodding and poking kind and philistine nature of some people there are to blame for our movement's lack of progress.</p>

<p>Please do elucidate your views as to vanguardism, I'd be interested to read them.</p>
