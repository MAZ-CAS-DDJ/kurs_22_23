<p>Allright, i thought it would be great to interview somepody from the group.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I would totally recommend joining them, they look really professional. Yeah sure, it would look great if you do same kind of presentation as i did with NRM thread, also i bet the leadership of Serbian Action would be impressed if you keep updating and advertise SA through the thread.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I recommend to contact this guy <a href="http://jpviktorjokinen.deviantart.com/" rel="external nofollow">http://jpviktorjokinen.deviantart.com/</a>and ask him to make Serbian Action flag, he makes really good looking pics, he made these NRM flags, </p>
