<p>I disagree with you on many things, but I was wondering if you're religious and what role, if any, this plays in your politics. This especially because of the unique role religion plays in Ukrainian national identity, between Russian Orthodox, Ukrainian Orthodox, and Ukrainian Catholics.</p>

<p>Yes, I am Greek Catholic and it plays a role in my political convictions. Above all, I think the three Ukrainian churches (Greek Catholic, Ukrainian Orthodox and Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox) should be united into a single Ukrainian national church (preferably in full communion with Rome). The Russian Orthodox Church, just like all things reflecting the occupation of Ukraine, should be banned from the country entirely.</p>
