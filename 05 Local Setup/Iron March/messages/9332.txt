<p>A common vision is essential for success, I agree totally. I and my girlfriend of two years broke up almost a year ago now, it could never have worked in the end because we were such different people despite all the good times we shared. It was incredibly painful at the time but I came to realize she had released me from her ideological domination. I rarely expressed my politics for fear of disapproval, I think she realized this subconciously and it soured her opinion more than if I had expressed my will. I had been lurking Ironmarch about 6 months prior to the breakup, and I joined maybe a day after it happened.</p>

<p>This community has done so much for me since, it has formed knowledge and opinions around my existing values and purged me of the weakening influences I was raised underneath. Without it, I would still be the same person but far inferior in character. I think we can both thank Alex and his hard work for this salvation.</p>

<p>We all have vices of course. I am not very good at organizing, for example. I could never learn how to take proper notes in class. The curse of a photographic memory, everything is too easy up to a point, then it is too hard.</p>

<p>I thought our similarities were uncanny before. No, they're utterly beyond remarkable!</p>
