<p>They sound like such a healthy and beautiful family. Seven kids must be quite a handful but I'd like more one day, once I've had a bit of time to be le edgy aktivist. </p>
<p>You've made me really excited for the camping trip I have in two weeks, campfires are love and life! <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>I want to spend a lot more time with the good Doctor, he is a wealthy man and I can foresee a close partnership in the interest and name of the German people. I don't think he would object to my undertaking of political recruitment beneath his historical initiatives. The elderly are indeed the treasure of the world.</p>
<p>My father is making good progress, he is seeing my point gradually. Even if he never comes to my side completely, he is not a thorn to my plans. He seems to support my concepts even if he justifies it merely as being "open minded."</p>
<p>Idk what you can do about your brother, he sounds like he needs a male role model. But I would not be suprised if your sister is just a lesbian until graduation, so don't be too hard on her. 9 times out of 10 homosexuality seems to be pressured or encouraged by the environment, natural fags are few and far between. At least I hope this is the case, so try to explain the problem softly to her and be sympathetic. But I'm sure you do this already. My mother says she's bisexual, as if she wasn't ovenable enough as it is, so I just ignore it best I can. I won't have to deal with her soon.</p>
<p>Btw I meant to ask before; what are your favorite baby names?</p>
