<p>You want the Turks to have a unified state and religion and it should be a great power, for this to happen your ideal state would want to reclaim terrorties and create a racial heirarchy, using the Caliph title is a means of controlling a billion Muslims. Besides the Middle East was stable under the Ottomans.</p>
