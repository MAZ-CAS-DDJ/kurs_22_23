<p>Hello there! You'll find that a lot of IronMarch members are actually pretty well traveled. I recently got back from a tour in Afghanistan, several other members have deployed or worked abroad as well. I've had a lot of cultural exposure as well over the years, having grown up in 'diversity' for better or worse, and being able to come to where I am today. I've had a lot of personal experience with a gamut of Arabs and Jews as well, to where my views of them tend to be a bit complex (<em>I don't consider myself anti-Semitic like most members, but my ideas would naturally repulse 90% of American Jews without me even making a conscious effort to</em>) and not easily contained into witty memes.<br /><br />And thanks! Yes that is me in the photo.</p>
