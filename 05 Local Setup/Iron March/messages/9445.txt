<p>Partidul "Totul pentru Țară" (lit. "Everything for the Fatherland" in English) was founded in 1993 through the initiative of a group of old partisans who took part in the Romanian anti-communist movement (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_anti-communist_resistance_movement" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_anti-communist_resistance_movement</a>), former political prisoners and mountain troops.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The party was born in a period characterised by the continuity and consolidation of the systematic structures from before 1989 (before the communist government was overthrown), through the development of immoral and corrupt politics, which stood out as a tumor for the entire society. These politics put in jeopardy the very existence of the Romanian people and the sovereign state of Romania, threatening Romania with isolation from the civilised world.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, the old warriors considered that the National Resistance must continue, of course, under the conditions imposed by the state of law.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Partidul "Totul pentru Țară" claims the values of the National-Christian doctrine, situated in the far-right in terms of Romanian politics.</p>

<p>Personally, it's better to support Noua Dreapta (<a href="http://www.nouadreapta.org/" rel="external nofollow">http://www.nouadreapta.org/</a>). They believe in the same values, but Noua Dreapta is more active and we see more of them on television and rallies.</p>
