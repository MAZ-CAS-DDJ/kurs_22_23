<p>America as we know it was formalized in 1789 and has undergone demographic shifts during the course of its history. The current immigration issue challenges the future of the American identity, but it's defense only raises the question of what our identity is.</p>
<p>The foundations of America begin with Jamestown and Mass. The first waves of those colonizers were uniquely Anglo- English, Scotch, and Irish who considered themselves Britons. The British were already an isolated frontiersmen society already, being protected by the English Channel. Only once since 1066 has Britain been invaded, and then at their own request to remove a Catholic king.</p>
<p>While the new world wasn't quite the same as the world they left, they maintained their British identity until the Revolution. Born on the East Coast, the new American country recognized itself as being born of British blood, destinied to encompass a different land. This stock can be witnessed up past the Civil War, and was important not just to our founders, but throughout the 19th century as well.</p>
<p>This identity began to change during the Gilded Age; both the industry in the North and Slavery in the south altered our perception of ourselves. As manufacturing grew in the North, waves of Irishmen, Poles, and Germans flooded into ghettoes, raising the first concern for the persistance of our ethnic heritage. On top of the ethnic change, the increasing number of Catholics worried our Protestant nation, and this change can be seen by the high number of Cahtolic communities thorughout the northeast. While cities were split across ethnic communities, we saw rural areas across minnesota and the Dakotas that didn't even speak English. This trend only ended with the Immigration Act of 1929, which barred nearly all immigration until the 1960's, allowing these communities to finally assimilate.</p>
<p>At the same time, our identity as a white nation was called into question. Originally brought as slaves, blacks were populated throughout the south to support it's agriculture. Up to the time of the civil war, though, they were not viewed as citizens, excepting few instances of freemen. Only after the war did blacks gain citizenship; the same amendment, now used to legitimize hispanics. Even being <em>de jure</em> citizens, though, they were not properly considered Americans until the civil rights movemnt nearly a hundred years later.</p>
<p>The consequences of this was that by the mid-60's, the US was multiracial, whites multiethnic, and the whole nation religiously divided. With such a heterogenous stock, coupled with liberal ethics, the perception of America as a melting pot, where all immigrants are equally American as those with long roots, seemed only natural. Unfortunately, this perception ignores the past; the ghettoization, race riots, and loss of human capital. While this is increasingly present today, and every study shows that diversity destroys the social capital of communities, it continues to be ignored in favor of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>This all only raises the issue, "How can we fight multiculturalism, without a clear identity?" We all know who we're not- we've never spoken spanish, our forefathers aren't latin mestizoes, and we have no Latin, Mesoamerican, or carribean heritage to speak of. To claim so would be incredibly difficult, as we're Northern Americans from start to finish. Anyone can see the difference between an American and a hispanic before they open their mouth, yet no amount of self-evidence will convince the cosmopolitan and xenophiles.</p>
<p>Since they will simply ignore the obvious and discuss our "immigrant" past, we need to assert our identity on commonalities, not merely exclusions. There are five characteristics which bind a nation together. These are language, ethnicity, religion, culture, and self-identification. Since we seek to clarify identity, self-identification becomes a bit redundant; on the other hand, our language and culture are ever-present. Sure, our language and culture are now world language and culture, but elsewhere they're secondary, whereas in America, they're <em>primary</em>, ingrained in us from birth.</p>
<p>That leaves us to identify based on religion and ethnicity, beyond what's already self-evident and ignored. These, too, are obvious- while we were one a protestant nation, we still are, but tolerant towards all forms of Judeo-christianity and secularism. And, yes, we have had immigrants in the past, but not from one nation, and not at so great a pace. Even though people identity as their most exotic ancestor, most still have plenty of founding stock still in their blood. Even the black community has about 40% of that blood in their veins, while no soi-disant German- or Italian-Americans will admit as much.</p>
<p>So, then, are we simply an immigrant nations?</p>
