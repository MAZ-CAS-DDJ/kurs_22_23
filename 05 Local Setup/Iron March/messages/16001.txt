	Lol, I read Turner Diaries when I was 12 years old when my Dad gave me the book. I loved it so much I read it a couple times. I am currently finishing up Next Leap, but I haven't started Siege yet..ill get right on that though.

	I'm 27 years old, I do drive but it may take me a week or so to have wheels because I'm flying in. And I am definitely willing to get involved in activism.Â
