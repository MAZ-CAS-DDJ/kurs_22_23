<p>I'm personally more of an ethnic nationalist. I don't believe in forcing different ethnic groups together to adopt a new artificial culture rather than one organically born from their own blood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I do however recognize the need to co-operate with one another against the monster that is present day America.</p>

<p>A common banner and overarching culture could be a good thing so long as it strengthens the people and their common ideals but they don't entirely lose themselves to it. Otherwise you just have another America with a top down culture (if culture it may be called) and a fully interchangeable population because the tradition of your past doesn't matter - you're now a common American.</p>

<p>Fascism is action so an action party would be ideal. Golden Dawn has the best strategy out of modern groups IMO. They don't just protest they literally are starting a revolution by taking over functions and competing directly with the state. Police won't help with crime ridden immigrant slum? GD skinheads remove them. Unemployed? GD will match you with a Greek company that wants to hire Greek workers only while exposing and attacking companies using cheap foreign labour. The government won't and because the people see action from Golden Dawn they'll gravitate towards the former fringe party.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The problem of course is to first motivate and convince people to join and become activists before you can carry out action.</p>
