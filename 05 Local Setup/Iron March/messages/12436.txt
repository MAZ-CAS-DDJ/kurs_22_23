<p>Hi, So  Odin and Weissewolf  I have spoken to you before. Americana and I have been organizing. I have not been on as much as I would like to. We have been building a library for the group as of late but work and family have been the mainstay of my time. Our gym is pretty good as we pooled stuff together. We have 3 kettlebells , bench press and bar with some plates, Pull up and dip frame, dumbells from 5 to 25 and resitance bands. So we have a nice little set up going and we have been meeting up just to get familiar with routes and schedules. We are planning some other stuff but we are just in our infancy. </p>
