<p>Exactly!  My favorite quote on these boards (courtesy of Slavros) is: "Preaching an old program in a completely new set of circumstances is often the worst kind of betrayal to ones own principles" - N.V. Ustrialov  The world has changed massively in the past 70 years.  At least the fascists of old had nation-states with which to work.  Globalization has robbed us of even this basic of fascism, and united the world against any threat to the established order.  The ambivalence that met Hitler's appointment as Chancellor is unthinkable in this climate of universal rights and virtues.  If someone were elected as Chancellor in Germany now that was 1/4 as openly radical as Hitler their stock market would crash, the UN would sanction them, and you could start the clock an an assassination or invasion.  However, I think Europe has discredited the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing strategy.  The parties always abandon principle for votes.</p>
<p> So, I think we are left with no choice but to work on the culture.  Bring back hero-worship, cultivate open disdain for cultural Marxism, glorify violence, order, discipline, and self-sacrifice.  We should promote any alternative media we can, and make the establishment at every chance they give us.  This is wonderfully easy, though.  They give us freedom: abuse and mock it.  They oppress us: call them hypocrites.  I'd say working on a coherent worldview is a concern, but right now I think agents of the radical right are more warriors against the modern world than advocates for fascism.  I'd suggest checking out American_Blackshirt's Iron Youth topic in the planning section and his Reaktion! journal.</p>
