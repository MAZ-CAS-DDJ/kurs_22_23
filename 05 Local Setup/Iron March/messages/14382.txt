	Laba diena!<br /><br />
	Today in Poland there is a quite large rising of patriotism and nationalism, but it lacks a decent movement, biggest groups are too moderate to effectively criticise the system. We in Falanga are trying to build a truly radical nationalist movement, but it's still a long way, although we are slowly, but constantly expanding our influences and more and more people know our media.<br /><br />
	Many Polish nationalists indeed share this chauvinistic attitude towards Lithuania because of various historical reasons and situation of Polish minority in your country. I also have sentiment for Kresy (Eastern Borderlands), but I know that hatred beetween our nations is senseless and we should seek cooperation. We may disagree about various things about Polish-Lithuania relations in 20th century, but now we have to think about future. It's obvious, that restoring pre-war Polish eastern border is unrealistic and senseless today. But we want respecting laws of Poles in Lithuania and fullfiling their demands – in exchange, Lithuanians in Poland can get the same laws. With this thing solved, we could establish closer cooperation in tight political, economic and military bloc with Poland and Belarus as a core and Baltic states would be naturally welcome as a part of that bloc, which we all need to achieve full independence from liberal western powers and Great Satan USA without becoming puppet of Russia (with which we should have normal, pragmatic relations). I know, that many Lithuanian nationalists are afraid of Polish domination and don't want to hear anything about any form of union, but in my opinion we should learn from past mistakes and form a commonwealth, where we all would respect each other as nations and could develop our national cultures without opression from anyone and without influences of degenerate globalist culture and merchants. The truth is that Lithuania is too small to achieve independence from foreign powers without regional cooperation. From my perspective Baltic region should be free from both Russian and Western influences, because it's too crucial to our geopolitical situation and we should secure our interests here – some form of union or at least loose federation would be the most peaceful and beneficial solution for us both. In the past we formed an union because the menace from both east and west was too big to deal with it alone – now we have similiar situation and we should both seek to remove western liberal influences and restore our former glory.<br /><br />
	Also I started learning Lithuanian several years ago, but unfortunately I had to stop after few months and I remeber only some basic words. But maybe I will try again in the future – I would be glad to know more about your culture.<br /><br />
	Your movement is interesting, I watched some of your clips. Are you focused just on action or do you want to involve in politics in the future?<br /><br /><br /><img class="ipsImage" src="http://i.imgur.com/yV2JEg7.png" alt="yV2JEg7.png" /></p>
