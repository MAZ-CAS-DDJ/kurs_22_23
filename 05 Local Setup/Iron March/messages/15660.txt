	What you are saying about women and the people is absolutely right. Yesterday I had some talk and drinks with my friends and we had a discussion on the same thing, though we came to the conclusion that it looks like the post-feminist generations of women are active rather than reactive precisely because feminists are telling them to be like that. So in a way they still obeying society, only this sick society teaches them not to obey. Well, not to obey men, but obey feminists that is.

	On the social issue, I heard that Romania today is in a slightly better shape than Hungary, but I really can't judge that. I was in Romania only once, and that was more than 10 years ago now.

	Hahaha. :D Don't worry. I had to show this to my brother to prove them there are good Romanians, but I won't tell anybody else. :) Vona said that if he want's to end the trench warfare in the Hungarian society he has to come up from his own trench, and he will be in danger, but that's the only way to get to the other trench, though by doing that he will be cursed by the people of both trenches; but that's the right thing to do.

	I have seen a picture of Bucharest, though I don't know what's the name of <a href="http://www.romaniatourstore.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/b/u/bucharest-sightseeing-tour.jpg" rel="external nofollow">that specific place</a>, but the first thing came to my mind was that it's like a Communist version of St. Peter's Square. It wasn't bad, it was interesting. I like Stalinist architecture, though I heard that Ceau»ôescu was a loony and he did his best to destroy that city. Also I heard some stories by a Hungarian guy who said that every city has a ghetto, but what is so absurd about Bucharest is that you have ghettos inside the city center, and that behind the National Opera you can see gypsies and rotting corpses of dogs. Is that true?

	I know about The Moon and the Nightspirit, but I am not familiar with their music. This one is nice.

	I'm not into Hungarian porn that much. :D All I know is that in the school we worshiped <a href="http://m.cdn.blog.hu/na/naked/image/201203/Michelle%20Wild/12.jpg" rel="external nofollow">Michelle Wild</a>, but I think she did get out of the business a long time ago. I heard that the Jewish porn industry is very interested in Eastern European women since they are extremely nice and cheap, but if I have to say a nation which is over-represented in porn I would say it's the Czechs. This depravity also comes from the reactive nature of women.
