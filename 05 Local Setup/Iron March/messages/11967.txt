<p>Hello Akhnaton,</p>
<p>This is Blackshirt 13 here. I am e-mailing you because I have a question for you. I noticed a while back that you posted a video from Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and I was just wondering if you have watched the whole series? Now I will admit that I can't fucking stand anime or anime fans (both disgust me) but I actually did watch Legend of the Galactic Heroes. I wouldn't even consider that anime because it is not degenerate shit. I was just curious if you had watched the whole thing and what you thought about it? Please let me know if you get this.</p>
<p>Hail, </p>

<p>PS I was goofing off on the Barnes and Noble website one day and typed in Legend of the Galactic Heroes and it looks like they are going to release the original comic book in English later this year. But seriously, I can't emphasize how much I hate anime but this was actually good.  </p>
