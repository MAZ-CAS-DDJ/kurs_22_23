<p>I've finished my Propaganda Narrative, but I've hit a writers block over the 'Beliefs' section that I could use a hand with.</p>
<p>Basicly with the writers block is where I'm trying to outline 'Corporatism' as a principle. I just can't seem to get the ball rolling without it turning into an overly-technical description of corporatism.</p>
<p>Anyway I'll post in the reply box the narrative and thebit I need help on. Feedback on the narrative would be helpful too.</p>
