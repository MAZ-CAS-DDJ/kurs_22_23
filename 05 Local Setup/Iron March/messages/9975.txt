<p>Non mainstream movements attracts people who are not part of the mainstream because it is too hard for them. I read some topics in the "showers" forum here. Oh wow. It's snowing special snowflakes.</p>

<p>I agree. Hordes of welfare troopers who will one day realize that they won't get "free" stuff to feed their kids who they couldn't afford. Combined with the "so cultured" hipsters who will realize food is not coming from the super market and their woman's study degree is worth nothing in the real word. Our society currently is shielding people from reality. One of the main reasons I adopted a more pragmatic and stoic way of life and thinking. Sometimes I may sound nihilistic but let's face it SJW-s will never be reformed so why should I care about them. </p>

<p>That's understandable. Greeks and Romans done many good things too. What I like in Europe is that the competition between rival nations, people and countries made it great back in the day. I would be glad to see the current liberal hallucination go away. The current "European values" are anything but European.</p>
