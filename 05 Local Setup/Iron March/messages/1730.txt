<p>A couple of months back you asked for some political recordings to put on zigavolk, Now that I have time I have been able to produce some examples in the past couple of weeks, and you can use these if you want. I am not sure how great your English is, but tell me if this interests you, if so which ones. </p>
<p>These two are readings, the first is my own work, the second is a reading with a commentary on the end. </p>
