	Nah I don't play it anymore. Last time I played was likely over a year ago. Last few games I have played have just been various grand strats to burn a few hours managing an empire / army etc.

	Went out tonight to a pub and made everyone heil Hitler and salute, shortly after this old guy that was sitting behind us left while greasing us off as hard as he could. It was hilarious. I can't stress enough how good it'd be to have locals in your area to hang out with and start getting active with. If not we can always use another man down here in Australia haha.

	Funny you should mention glasses, I've always had perfect vision up till recently. Took an eye test a few days ago and it turns out over the past 2 years (2 years ago the vision was perfect) I've made myself slightly short sighted from too much computer (fuck you programming) or sitting too close to the screen or something. If you are gonna spend time on the PC make sure you take breaks and sit an arms length from that screen.
