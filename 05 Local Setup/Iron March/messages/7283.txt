<p>Hello,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, unfortunately I closed it down due to a lack of time; I have plans to begin writing again in the near future. I'm glad that you appreciated some of my articles, and I'm honored that you think they're worth while including in your quarterly. If they make it, please do let me know what sort of reaction they get. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'll have a look to see if I have anymore,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Best wishes.</p>
