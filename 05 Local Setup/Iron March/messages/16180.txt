	Hail Odin,
</p>

<p>
	hope you are well, especially with my namesake tearing through your area.
</p>

<p>
	I wanted to get in contact with you here to coordinate contacting your Oregon division. I would like to be able to rally extra troops to the cause when, for example the antifags threaten someone like our mutual friend Jimmy. Right now AV Oregon is very small, just a few guys. It would be great to have your org to count on, to stand together when the vultures are circling...
</p>

<p>
	If nothing else, I just want to keep theÂ lines of communication open with you. We have a lot of respect for your org, its approach, and I am really getting into SIEGE. Keep fighting the good fight.
</p>

<p>
	All for now. Hail Victory!
</p>
