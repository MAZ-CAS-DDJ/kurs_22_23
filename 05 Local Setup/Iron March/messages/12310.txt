<p>To be honest, I don't know much about MD, but I've been trying to get in contact with other fascists (or even nationalists) in quebec for a while, and haven't had much luck (it seems the people here are terribly afraid of the system...). So I'd be interested in learning more about it. Anyway, if the MD quebec guys want to know about me, my online persona is well known at this point (wrote a few books, admin on Noose and this forum and the archive, wrote articles here and there...). In terms of physical skills, they can judge for themselves if they meet me in person.</p>
