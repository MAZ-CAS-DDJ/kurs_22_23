	I like what I'm hearing. I'll introduce myself a little bit and tell you what you'll be dealing with.

	My name is Liam. I've started my own group/think-tank by myself and hand picked my members based on my judgement. All of the members must be Polish/have Polish lineage, and have a serious faith in Catholicism or Paganism. We have a couple Pagans in the group but its mostly Catholic Traditionalists. We do not recognize the Vatican II, since its clear that its been infiltrated by Zionists. My group is to eventually be transformed into a Paramilitary. We have 3 Poles going into Straz Graniczna (Armed Border Guard), I'm in my Senior year of highschool and I will be enlisting into the Marine Corps next year, and Wiatrowski is former-National Guard/Medic/Firefighter. It seems like you will be a perfect addition to the group as well. I'm looking for devoted members who want to defend their Polish heritage. We need intelligent, experienced, and god-fearing men. For now, the chat is serving its purpose as a way to broadcast ideas. We are planning some meetups soon in the United States exclusively. Next year is Poland.
