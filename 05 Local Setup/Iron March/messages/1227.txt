<p>Well I have to hand it to you. You recovered in a month! I've had strong feelings for someone for five years. Five years of that and some inhibitions concerning a certain something you mentioned earlier about somebody on Iron March, but I don't want to get into that now. Problem is she is part of those inhibitions. And she is engaged to a "professional golfer". I try EVERYTHING to get her to pay attention to me. It does suck. I honestly don't date and once turned down a date with a girl because of her. And she was in Dallas at the time, I live in LA. Damn you Youtube. I am so glad I can drink now. It will help me get through things better until I find a decent medication. </p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear that you are having problems like that, but trust me, if you can move on you'll be fine. The right one is out there somewhere for you. If it helps, I  actually think you are much better off than I am. You are looking for the right girl. I already found her. She just is not available. And may never be. hope this helps.</p>
