	Well there is a process in court for his "rehabilitation". Rehabilitation is more to restore his "citizenship rights and honor" + material restitution to his heirs, because he was murdered (official story is suicide but that too is disputed in court now)he never got sentenced as a traitor or war criminal or anything like that, only smeared in media by communists.<br /><br />
	Petition is started now because his name is more known in public and more truth about him appear online and even in some mainsteam media (like newspapers NOVOSTI) so the public is more and more introduced to him and truth about his deeds and his death and his life overall. We know this petition won't pass, but it is kind of a beginning to normalize his name and to be recognized as a hero to the Serbs after 70+ years.<br /><br />
	Yeah, I posted it now because of the recent lecture we had so I merged the two.<br /><br />
	Well, Serbian Action is the only "fascist" movement in Serbia. All other are indirectly inÂ service of current regime. Overall everyone are libtards except us, if you're interested in why (if you think I'm biased) I can explain to you in more detail.<br /><br />
