	Towards what?
</p>

<p>
	I haven't heard about Vojtech Tuka before, but if I remember correctly there were official negotiations around 1938-39 for Slovakia to form a joint kingdom with Hungary, but of course on different basis as it was before so I guess it would have been a union or a federation of our states ruled by a monarch accepted by both nations. Anyway, it's interesting to see the historical dilemma of Slovaks, seeking alliances with different nations (even Poland was a possibility back then) and also independence.

	That sounds great! What was the opinion back then about the First Vienna Award? Hungarian politics were led mostly by the thirst for revenge for Trianon, but since ethnically the 1938 borders were more just I would think the Slovaks could accept the loss of territory more easily. Also I haven't seen any Revisionist Slovak propaganda from that period, only those nice borders I like so much. :D

	Nice, we like Death Cults here. How much do you know about the Romanian Iron Guard and their views on the dead?

			Rumors says that only three people (priests) know where it is and when one of them is going to die 2 remaining tells secret to another one. They always make oath where they promise that they will tell secret to public, only when Slovakia becomes Slovak and Catholic again.

	CLERICO-FASCIST CONSPIRACY IN MODERN SLOVAKIA!!! This is awesome! It's a shame we didn't manage to hide our crown while you were able to hide an entire body and keep it secret since! You should really post an article on Hlinka and his cult including this story.

	Thanks for your letter it was a good read!
