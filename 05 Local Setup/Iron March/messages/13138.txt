	You seem like you are pretty intelligent, and I need a hand for this.  I have the full sponsor list for about 17 LGBT groups.  2 of them are PAC's, and provide some detailed information about their donors.  One has even received donations from government officials.  The vast majority of these are large corporations; big names with big interests.  They include Goldman Sachs, Alphabet inc, Wells Fargo, Centers for Disease Control, and Planned Parenthood.

	Could we start a joint operation between judas watch and subvert to analyze this data?  Multiple eyes will be needed to fully understand the interests behind the donations, and this will add a lot to the Judas watch database (there are both people and companies, keep in mind).
