	Only some parts of it. The perception of reformers is always limited, and this makes them unable to see the suprarational synthesis of the rationally opposite things. In Christianity you have to love your enemy, that's typically something what rational people cannot grasp (<a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/7117-pope-francis-vs-cardinals/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=172230" rel="">last paragraph here</a>). There are explanations what makes it easier for us to understand these mysteries, f.ex. when they say "hate sin, love the sinner", or when they interpret the mystery of Holy Trinity as three aspects, or three faces of the same God. However these are never perfect and always have to be adjusted to the understanding of the people.
</p>

<p>
	The first thing you will see when you are talking to reformers is that they are choosey. They always want to broke the unity of their Tradition and pick only those things what they like. This wouldn't be a problem it wasn't coupled with the despise of those things what they don't like; or in other words if it would happen according to the principle of "<span>Jedem das Seine</span>", which would be a return to the cults in a way: average followers would care about the everyday practice, theologians would care about theology (and everyday practice), mystics would care about mysticism (and theology, and everyday practice). The hierarchy would be re-established, in which the average follower has no word. This was changed by democracy, what made the masses believe that they can decide, thus destroying the walls of discipline what was guarding them from manipulation. That's the same with children: if you tell them that they are clever enough to decide for themselves, you lie and the only thing you want to do is to secretly take over their control.

<p>
	Possibly, but not necessarily. Christianity disintegrated because the humanistic-democratic-individualistic was the most influential among its deviations. This deviation isn't that powerful in Islam, it is the mentality of the ruthless slave what is becoming dominant instead. I think that it will "unify the people" (unity is based on differences and hierarchy, this will be the satanic opposite of it - uniformity), but by an absurdly primitivized remnant of the original Islam. Imagine a horde with only one question as their religion: do you follow Allah? If your answer is wrong they kill you. Either way, the balance will be lost along with the meaning behind the word 'Islam'.

<p>
	Because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_scriptura" rel="external nofollow">'sola scriptura'</a>. They stated that all you need in order to understand God is the Bible; that it is the only source of Christianity. You see, that's how a change in the religion (namely the translation of the Bible) could lead to a catastrophe. In the Middle Ages it was only the Clergy who were able to speak Latin (and in that time the Bible was translated only to Latin), the others spoke their original or 'national languages' (this is funny because in that time 'natio' meant the aristocracy and they have spoken Latin too, so calling those languages 'popular' would be more correct). This was an elitistic element which protected the religion from the stupidity of the masses - you had to be worthy enough to be educated, and clever enough to learn. Then came the translations and the printing which gave the Bible to more and more people, which is the same as abandoning more and more standards. Sola scriptura is like giving a code to someone without a key, and saying that every conclusion is right.

<p>
	That's a tricky question. I think that if someone makes it impossible for you - or himself - to follow the 1st requirement, you are allowed to violate the 2nd one. In a hierarchy it always works like this; if any of the elements are going against each other you automatically have to side with the element with primacy.

<p>
	Every political perspective comes with a spiritual background. When an organism has been changed by mechanistic means, you have to use mechanistic ways to restore its former state. F.ex. if you change the DNA of a living organism, whatever it does after, it will be unable to change it back. It becomes its program, what cannot be altered from the inside, thus you have to restore its original DNA by the same mechanistic means what have been used to change it.

<p>
	That's true, it can be turned to that shit if somebody vulgarizes it, but remember how Christianity was originally the religion of the proud and heroic Crusaders and how it is the religion of those with guilt and cowardice today. That's because it's not the same Christianity, the latter is but a perversion of it. Everything has a different kind of perversion, but all perversions are wrong. Just as people have degenerated differently thus they need different religions to find their way back to God, every religion/ideology has a different perversion what it has to avoid. In some cases you can clearly see how religions are trying to hold back the sins what causes their perversions - Arabs, because of the telluric element in their blood are more likely to be tempted, that could be the main reason behind the burqa. Let me quote <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2013/10/the-races-of-the-spirit/" rel="external nofollow">Evola</a> on that:

			The telluric race (from Lat. <i>tellus</i>; earth) has an explosive impulsiveness, sudden changeability, and absolute self-identification. This race is as “intensive” as it is gloomy, without however the depth and detachment which are necessary to also be tragic. Sexuality has a considerable part in this race; the sentiment of personality in the telluric man is little developed, it is the collective element that predominates; it is in this sense that blood ties are manifested, and always in a material, atavistic and fatalistic form; this can be recognized in some of the typical aspects of the sentiment of race peculiar to the Jewish people.

			Now, I remember we talked about something similar to this in my introduction thread, where you said that a Sufi mystic and a Christian ascetic can know and respect each other, but still they'd be against equality and humanism. But I never understood your actual reasoning behind that. How do you separate this from typical humanistic egalitarianism?

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's because of the unifying essence and the dividing substance. Hungarian Traditionalists are explaining this by saying that you have two "selves", your personality, and your true Self. I am the follower of Solipsism which says that the latter is God Itself - remember:

</blockquote>

<p>
	It is our personalities which got between us and the Almighty (that's why the mystics and the ascetics are destroying their personalities); thus getting closer to God is always unifies (remember the metaphor of the mountain and its peak). When we, Fascists are saying that we want Truth, even if we will not like it, it means that we want to get closer to God, even if we have to sacrifice our personalities. In God, we are One. I'm not sure where have I heard this (it could be a Buddhist teaching), but it is true, that "it's only our sins what makes us different".
</p>

<p>
	Now that's the opposite of Humanism because Humanism focuses on our personalities, on those things which separates us from God.  It is also the opposite of equality, because the Christian knows that for him and his people the Sufi path would be impassable - that's why he lets the dividing substance intact, because it is essential for those at the foot of the mountain. If you won't divide the paths people will never know where to go - but this Christian knows that every path leads to the top. By paths I mean intact Traditional religions/mysteries of course; I would never say that Protestantism, Atheism, etc. leads to the top - it is precisely because of the rise of these heresies why we, who want to get to the top have to cooperate with each other. This means that I want our Christians to be more Christian, to get close to true Christianity, just as I want our Muslims to be more Muslim, even our Pagans to be more Pagan (only I think their path is overly hard to take), but with the understanding of the synthesis of the esoteric (inner, unifying essence) and the exoteric (outer, dividing substance) element. This looks paradoxical, but by being a better Christian you will get closer to a true Muslim.
</p>

<p>
	I say "God has no religion" because most of us here are obsessed with the dividing substance. I have even heard absurdities like "God of Hungarians" from my compatriots. It is hard to find something more heretical than that. Hungarians don't have a God; God has Hungarians. That's a big difference.

	For those people Islam is the only way to God. If they want to block your way, then your anger is understandable, but I say you should search for those on the other path who just want to go further, because ultimately there are two kinds of people: those who want to get to the top and those who want to block others. The latter is your enemy, even if he is on your path, but the former can be your true friend, even if he walks the other path.

	You will get a better understanding of Solipsism by reading those, but watch out, because just as I stated before, everything has a perversion, and most of the people are using Solipsism as a synonym for Egoism and Individualism, because they don't know about the difference between the personality and the Self.
