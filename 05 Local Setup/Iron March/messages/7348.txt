<p>I'll watch it on my phone later since I can't see through tor. Still in South America at the moment and probably going to stop here for a few years. I'm going to post on the forum a bit more again soon but I'm being cautious at the moment because of a pyramid scheme which paid off but you know what women are like - they can't keep their mouths shut whether they're trying to scorn you or because they're so fucking proud - go figure lol, so that's the short reason why I'm in Venezuela. I took a trip to Lima in Peru 2 weeks ago and that was pretty cool, did some surfing there, it's a relatively safe place for South America, didn't over stay my welcome or tell anyone about that little trip; getting extradited from Venezuela is a bitch, other countries not so much so. I'm in the best place, it's just amazing and fun to live here, it's a place you'd certainly like, tons to do, lots of national parks, water rafting, kayaking and not least of all base jumping. Political environment is tense but pretty much anti-zionist and nationalistic to a degree on all accounts. Lots of potential for South America.</p>

Keep an eye on UKIP and British politics. Myself and my boys had some stuff up our sleeves concerning an infiltration of UKIP and as far as I last heard that was still ongoing.</p>
