	Hey Akhnaton,
</p>

<p>
	This is Blackshirt 13 here. I just wanted to ask if you still wanted me to give you my thoughts on Vol. 1 of the novel LOTGH? I just started read it today so it might be a while, but it could be sooner then I originally thought. Let me know what you think.

	Hail,

	PS I found out a while back that they will only release Vol. 3 in English if the first two sell well, so I guess if they don't I'll only get to have Vols 1 and 2. Yes, that would suck but fortunately since we know how the story ends ends already, if worse came to worse it wouldn't be a completely tragic, just hugely inconvenient.
