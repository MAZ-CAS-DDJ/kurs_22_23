	Well, you should be building up your organization in your own area if possible. Whether it's a AW chapter or a book club or whatever isn't really important, since they're all independently managed anyway. You can do both, or even more, and factor that into your recruitment strategy. For example, you have your AW chapter, and advertize book club meetings on DS. You do monthly or weekly meetings for the book club, and if people compatible with the AW chapter show up, you invite them there.

	The quality of the bonds between the members is more important than the name you give the group. So the essence of your thinking should be in how to improve those bonds, first and foremost. The rest is all tactics. As to what you should do once you got a group going, refer to "this is the plan" on noose.
