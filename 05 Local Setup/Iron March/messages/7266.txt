<p>There's a greater sense of maturity and getting on with things here instead of dwelling on them and the drug laws are pretty reasonable depending on where you are. Venezuela and Peru have decent laws and Bolivia's aren't too bad either. The geopolitics are good but the undying love of economic socialism can be annoying (a mixture is best IMO - private property and freedom to choose who to trade with but welfare for those who deserve it and putting measures in place for those unemployed and too poor/low quality to have lots of kids).</p>
<p>Life's pretty good, that's all I can say really without going into too much detail. Imagine semi-retiring early, having relative freedom over what you do in the day and having plenty of sex - that's pretty much my life. These celibates, pseudo-celibates and prudes are literally the bane of the world. They love to have an opinion on everything.</p>
<p>Got some good links for you too regarding drugs</p>

<p>Pretty decent site in general to be honest. Getting back into drugs and exercise was the best thing I ever did.</p>
