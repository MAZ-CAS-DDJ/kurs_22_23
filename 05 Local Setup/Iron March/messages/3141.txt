<p>A multi-Lingual Archive is ideal and we are resolved to make that, anyway there is not much point in making such a big project and limiting it - everyone should be able to dump everything.</p>
<p>To my mind only one issue arises. It will differ only in that English will be the rosetta stone in that it will contain material from all countries - translated into english. Wheras it may be easier navigation and better organisation to limit other languages to a national basis. Like this is our dutch archive</p>

<p>It will probably just be that and a dutch mein kampf- probably itself put out by a dutch national organisation.</p>
