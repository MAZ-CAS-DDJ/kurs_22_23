	Bicep curls , hammer curls, push ups , bench press , you don't have to do alot since I assume you don't huge muscles as a woman. you can do them so you build strength just do repetitions at a weight your comfortable with and work your way up to a lot of repetitions. Increasing the weight will increase muscle mass.
