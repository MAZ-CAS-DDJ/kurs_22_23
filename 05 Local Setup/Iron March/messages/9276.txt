<p>1. When you want to gain weight, drink your calories (smoothies are your friend), because it doesn't cut your appetite so much. When you want to lose fat, do the opposite and avoid drinking calories as much as possible.</p>
<p>2. You're never going to gain significant weight unless you count your calories. Trust me, I've tried. Your body is incredibly efficient at figuring out how much food to eat to <em>maintain</em> your body weight, and it'll mindfuck you into eating less than you need to grow. Calculate how many calories you need daily (including your work outs) and eat 500-1500 more than that. The same is true in reverse when you want to lose weight. If you just change your lifestyle or "make an effort", then you'll grow for a week or two, then your body will adapt and the growth will stop. Keep a notepad in your backpocket and write down everything you eat/drink, tally it daily.</p>
<p>3. At 145lb, you'll probably need <em>at least</em> 3500 calories per day, but 4000-4500 would be a safer bet.</p>
<p>4. You'll need sleep and rest to build muscle too, don't train 5-6x per week, 3 should be enough <em>if the training is intense enough</em>. That means you should squat every session. Squatting heavy 3x per week, by itself, would be sufficient to get you to bulk up pretty quick. Add deadlifts, presses and chinups and you've got your whole body covered very well. Don't fall for the 20 exercise training program, it's a waste of time. curls and situps are a waste of time. Cable machines are also useless. I'm assuming you won't be taking steroids.</p>
<p>5.Try to eat more fat on rest days, more carbs on training days, lots of protein everyday.</p>

<p>I don't know if that answers you questions, if you have anything more specific, ask away.</p>
