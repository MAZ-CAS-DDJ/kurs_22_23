<p>I get the feeling you don't talk about it much, but it's all that's on your mind, eh? Same here. Everyone I know is tired of hearing, not that I know that many people, and I've said the same shit over and over. But it's still on my mind just as much, if not more so. He always used to listen to nasheeds to relax, now every time I hear a nasheed (my boss is a paki so every day) I feel like breaking a window with my face. Mainly this one though.<br /></p>

<br />It was playing an hour before he told me he was going to leave. I was sitting at home and I had some youtube playlist on. This came up on it and it hit me right in the chest, ach. It was a bad sign. So I couldn't breathe while it was playing and I couldn't move to turn it off. I don't even speak Italian. Then he called and said he was moving back to Texas, and that it wasn't because of anything I'd done but he couldn't see a future and not to blame myself etc. So I said ok and we hung up and I threw up, and this was all before I understood the lyrics! I listen to it still, for some masochistic reason.<br /><br />That last paragraph, that's exactly how I feel. If I didn't have a job I'd just sleep all day. "All I want to do is take care of my wife and kids, except I don't have a wife and kids." A-yep. You find some real meaning in your life and lose it, no other shadow of purpose is going to interest you.<p>Â </p>
<p>I like hiking and going innawoods. I'm starting a vegetable garden in my yard and a bunch of new seedlings for the forest. I'm really excited about that! We grow grapes and apples already, I save them for cooking in the winter. I really like cooking and food you will notice. I used to bike a lot, and I still run and work out and such like. What about you?</p>
