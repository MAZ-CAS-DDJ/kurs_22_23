	Hello. I have read your thread and would like to ask how you are doing with purging your life of useless rubbish. I had problems like you at one point but got over them. I never felt better when I realized what was wrong with my lifestyle. What exactly has been clouding your mind? What really has been troubling the edgypseudogermanname?
