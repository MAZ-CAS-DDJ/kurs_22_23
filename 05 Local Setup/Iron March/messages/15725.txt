	Ha ha, yeah that's the truth. No offence but I kind of want to save up for a trip to Predappio one day. My "pilgrimage" so to speak. Ha ha yeah genetics kind of gave me a raw deal with flat feet (I mean no arches at all, people who see my feet always say that I have the flatist feet they have ever seen, which unfortunately is reflected by my walk, pretty obvious to tell if you pay attention), my height, my glasses, and of course my fucking OCD. Although, I think the last one isn't genetic but still. Oh well, at least I was born Aryan. :)
