<p>I know what it's like seeing a synagogue in your town. It's disgusting. At least Jews as a whole are push overs. They'll bitch and moan, but they aren't going to get violent. </p>

<p>I'm glad my son is big, but the downside is he'll be bigger than me. I'm 5'8. I would've been taller but I wasn't fed too well in my teen years.   It's going to be weird bossing around kids taller, broader, and bigger than me lol. </p>
