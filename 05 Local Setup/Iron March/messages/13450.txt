	I hate to tell you this, but since I'm an Aussie I have a lot of lag issues playing online games with people that are a long way away

	I get 200+ ping on Californian servers, more like 300+ for Midwestern ones - it's generally fine because Oceania tends to have pretty solid server infrastructure for Aussies and New Zealanders, but in cases like these it's obviously inhibiting<br /><br />
	I'll add you on Steam anyway once I get home from work, but just be aware we probably won't be able to play most things where ping is a serious issue, although that doesn't necessarily exclude everything you might want (there is a good /int/ server for autismblocks that seems to run fairly smoothly even at high pings, for example)
