	I would definitely be interested. Â Only problem is lately ive had alot going on with work and other personal stuff. It might be a little while before I can get involved. But in the mean time, I know a few good lads up here, Specifically im with the Eureka Youth League in Brisbane, Ill ask around if they'd be also be interested. Until then put my Name down as a prospect of some sorts. Once ive sorted my shit Id love to become dedicated to this.<br /><br />
	Do you guys have some sort of manifesto or list of goals that Id be able to refer people to?
