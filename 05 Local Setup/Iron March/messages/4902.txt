<p>Someone posted Carleton Coon's Races of Europe on the forum the other day. It was when I read years ago that I really started to get into the anthropology side of race. I think most people on the site are slowly coming over to just adopt racism as part of fascism. It's about time as well because Mussolini was without a doubt a racist. His 'race is only a feeling' quote came much later in the 1930s IIRC, before that he was making comments which couldn't be dismissed as anything but racist, not to mention he was disappointed when he got reports of Italians blandaa'ing up with the Ethiopians when they took over. A thread about all this stuff will probably come in due course.</p>

<p>I'm glad to see posters like Boia Chi Mola are becoming anti-semitic as well. It really is like seeing the birth of mini Hitlers; he went through the same patterns of criticism before becoming an anti-semite. Many members are openly anti-gay as well; this is a great change from what I saw in sympathetic posts from 2011. The great thing is this site isn't filled with hobbyists that take themselves too seriously like stormfront and vnn, but they are rooted in concrete principles and are human, not always on the defence; they can speak for themselves too, they don't have to endlessly quote from Nietzsche (who I still think is overrated and not the golden standard on Paganism/fascism) or 'scientific' journals to prove their points, they can just appeal to real life issues and sentiments - down to earth logic. I've found that approach works much better.</p>
