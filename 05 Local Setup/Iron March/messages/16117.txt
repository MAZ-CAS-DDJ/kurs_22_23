	What are the surprises in the first 30 min, can you give me the time for them, didn't seem to notice any.

	I'll talk to Zeiger about how to best approach this, as either a multitude of shorter clips focusing on particular moments thematically or if we process the whole video or if we keep this one as the "full, little to no nonsense" copy and then have the various thematic clips.Â

	I'm personally for keeping one copy as no nonsense with the intro/outro, so basically what you already have now, and then just making a series of short (5, 10, 15 minutes) thematic clips where you take specific segments of the conversation to deliver particular points accentuated with music and visuals, maybe like ww2 clips with various retro/vaporwave music and overlaying effects.

	The whole thing is really about being creative as fuck using the exact style you guys have cultivated with your own videos so its honestly about your artistic freedom so I wouldn't want to impose too many rules beyond those basic directions.
