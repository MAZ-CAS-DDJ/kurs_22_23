	Unfortunately urban Cascadia is also turning into a tech industry area. Seattle/Bellevue, which is where Microsoft, Amazon, and T-Mobile are based. It's Silicon Valley's main competition. And Silicon Valley (Intel especially) basically owns Portland's economy now, it's called Silicon Forest, though a lot of us think that'll collapse. There are way more newcomers than there are jobs available for them, so a lot of them leave after a year or so. And Portland's economy is really rocky.<br /><br />
	The South and Cascadia are the only ones really active. The South for old resentments about losing to the Union, and a long cultural gap before then. Cascadia to preserve its uniqueness and sense of isolation. There's also Alaska and Hawaii independence movements. Alaska wants to become a small-government place for old-fashioned constitutionalism, also be able to take advantage of its oil resources. Hawaii wants to become a multiculti hellpit with the native royal family restored as constitutional monarchs.
