<p>Well, if you remember, I always had a problem with the Pope.  Looking at Christian history we can see that Pope did hold an honorary status and had a significant amount of influence, he was an equal to the other Patriarchs.  Also, I don't like some other Catholic doctrines such as the Immaculate conception, mariology, amongst other things.  Not only all of that but the universalism practiced by the Catholics is quite different than was intended I believe.</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with the DL of Saron.  I'll have to look into it.  We use the DL of Tikhon because he based it off of the book of common prayer and some Latin ideas.  It really is an Orthodoxy for Americans or anyone in the Anglospere for that matter, there have also been theoretical talks regarding the Western rite being the official rite of a future American Orthodox church (hopefully).</p>
