	I was mostly referring to those of V4 countries that are Catholic. I predict in time they will form their own national churches as it was attended for us.<br />

			Yup and we really owe them for that, but strangely they were happy to become Communists when their loyalty was the most needed. They have also somehow just forgot to pull back from Transylvania, just as Serbia took Vojvodina; but what I was referring to was that if you are implying that today's Vatican is Catholic, than the Soviet Union was an Orthodox state. Soviets destroyed Orthodox churches - the <strong>anti</strong>-Pope lets other governments to destroy churches. Soviets tried to destroy the Church itself - the <strong>anti</strong>-Pope tries to do the same. This madman is clearly a heretic, but as I stated before, the corruption of the Church applies to Orthodoxy as well, even if to a smaller extent. What is it in the Catholic teaching what you are against? Or is that only the structure of the Clergy?

	Well, Vatican is literally the seat of the Catholic Church, meaning their laws ARE canon of Catholic Church and if Pope is infallible, his word is the authority. Now, if you oppose these things you're not Catholic. CCCP couldn't be Orthodox in any way because majority of people declared atheist (forced or not). It's not the same with Orthodoxy. Yes we have corrupted priests who have expensive cars, some clergymen are tight with some corrupt politicians etc, but the core of the Church, it's teachings are preserved from the very foundation and its canon is unchangeable. You will not hear from our patriarchs that fags and atheists are ok, we should flood our lands with foreigners (they are preaching quite opposite of that), and other seriously degenerate things. What I'm against? The very idea of infallible pope, their understanding of the Christian theology that passed through reforms.<br /><br />

			Hmm. You know, it is possible that it will be similar to the fall of the Monarchies. In the XX. century the Monarchs lost their power, but Fascist leaders have kept the Monarchic system (well, in most of the cases) and ruled as some kind of Regents. I hope we can do something similar with V4, (like a Sedevacantist Union, lol) but I doubt that we will ever become Orthodox nations. I don't believe in national Churches. Eternal Truth doesn't give a shit about our ever-changing borders.

	West is losing its grip on V4 nations and its quite logically in foreseeable future Russia will take over (not in a Stalins way, but in protection of the sovereignty - which seems to be Kremlin's ideology today). Becoming orthodox isn't that big of a fantasy, I mean you already have Greek Catholic church in Hungary, and Poland, Czech and Slovakia have their own Orthodox churches. Churches can't lose anything with this. National churches are not "Churches for X people", they are called national because they hold their service on the native language of ones people and incorporate folk festivals into it's calendar. It's a matter of being closer to the people of certain land and bringing the truth closer to them.<br />

			Yeah, yeah, spare me from that. The "MINDENT VISSZA"-mentality was never a solution (Hungary is actually even smaller then it became after WW1, the same applies to Germany and to other states as well). It will just further destroy you, and that's not Defeatism - I want all of our territories back, not through Revanchism but its opposite. You will never let in your house somebody you don't like, but old comrades can even stay if they have to. You can live together with Hungarians, and if God helps us you will also learn how to live together with your Croat <em>brothers</em>.

	Its not the same mindset. I don't wish for Greek or Bulgarian land, just ours. Serbs of other faiths are living there, not foreigners.
