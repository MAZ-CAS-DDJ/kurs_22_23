<p>As far as i know, we don't have any pirates, they only work within my country. And we Filipinos are the ones who are being taken hostage by the pirates in Somalia. Also yes we do have a lot of drug smugglers/pushers/users, although a lot are thieves/rapists/murderers.</p>

<p>We also have this mass robbery of the country, but it has been happening since 1565. We will have to unite together against the capitalists, and rebuild our countries. Chaos must first ensue, so that we could use the opportunity to rebuild our countries.</p>
