	Hello, Vasiszta. Remember me? It's the fascist Kurd from a while back.

	Anyway, so I always enjoy reading your posts because you tend to focus so much on Tradition and spirituality (more so than most users here), and this is one area where I need to improve my understanding of the fascist worldview. I'm always so action-oriented and caught in day-to-day problems that I often lose sight of the greater Truth, and sometimes confusions arise.

	Right. So the thing I'm confused about is that I noticed you talked with some users about ISIS and Islam and all of that, and you mentioned how ISIS is not a true return to Islamic Tradition. That comment of yours took me aback, because even though I've always hated Islam and ISIS from a personal/subjective perspective (since Islam is the enemy of the Kurds), but objectively speaking, I've always thought ISIS would qualify as the truest expression of Islam in basically 1400 years. I remember you argued with some guy over how ISIS corrupted the essence of truth or whatever. But isn't Truth something that you have to live by? So if ISIS literally lives by the "truth" of Islam, how does that somehow corrupt its tradition? In fact, isn't the goal of any fascist group based on returning to Tradition and living by it?

	And that really made me wonder about the concept of Tradition in general, and I guess there's something I'm missing here, or maybe I'm confusing different issues together (or perhaps this will ultimately just be a matter of disagreement, like the whole Paganism vs Christianity thing). I don't know. Any clarification would be appreciated. Thanks!
