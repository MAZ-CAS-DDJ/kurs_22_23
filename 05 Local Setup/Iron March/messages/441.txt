<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I just saw that you went on my profile. I am having difficulty fixing my avatar, every time I try to upload a picture it says that it failed to upload. I am going to prepare an introduction post for myself maybe tomorrow sometime.</p>
<p>Regarding your comments through email:</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="178" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>At the beginning, it was actually very good. It was great actually. To know that someone was actually going to start a movement that was a serious alternative to capitalism without all the authoritarianism and the class chauvinism towards those lower on the social ladder (within the race). It degenerated though, (admittingly, like you said). They are all internationalists and love diversity now. Fuck them. The one moderator "CeltIberian" in the beginning went as far as saying "I don't care about other peoples, I only care about my own". It is different now, and they alienated a great deal of people in the name of complete economic reductionism. </div></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, some things just don’t mix. Marxism and  Nationalism don’t really mix, and because Marxism reduces everything to just economics (as I explained to you in the past) Nationalism was bound to be pushed to the backseat – especially with all of those more Far-Left types on there like “Coach”. I actually read a few things by Marx and Engels which you may have not even read and I discovered that the Socialist Phalanx people misinterpreted Marxism; it is actually seriously anti-Nationalist at its core.</p>

Have you ever read the writings of Strasser?</div></blockquote>
<p>No, I never got into Strasser. Care to recommend anything?</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="178" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Oh yes, I forgot to mention my name on there. My name on there is SchwarzFrontUSA. They do kind of annoy me too; currently they are trying to justify the state of Israel to me on the grounds of "it is great and nationalistic and imperialist just like our great fascist nation (which doesn't even recognize race) will be! huur duur"</div></blockquote>
<p>Israel would be a good state if it were not for certain policies it has. They not only genocide Palestinians, but they steal young women from Eastern Europe to sell them into prostitution, and they also steal organs from kids in Palestine and Eastern Europe. I saw an article once called “Israeli Organ Trafficking and Theft: From Moldova to Palestine.” Moldova is an ethnically Romanian nation that split off from Romania, but they are Romanians nonetheless! Read the article here:</p>

<p>Goddam Kikes never stop sucking off of us!</p>

I think I will retire for the night very soon here though, I caught a nasty bug and I am fatigued and congested</div></blockquote>
<p>Very well, I hope you get better. No need to rush with the essays, one of them is long and I don’t know how anybody could enjoy reading them off a phone.</p>
