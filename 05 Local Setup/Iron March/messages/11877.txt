<p>I read your post about that, made me so fucking mad.</p>
<p>It was food and I got caught. Like, ten dollars worth lol. Since then I've stopped stealing entirely, took up dumpster diving instead. I'm just glad I didn't get caught on return fraud... hard to find work out here so ive been at this for years.</p>
<p>It's the very mild charge and I do think I'll get off fine, I just have to stay out of trouble. I sat in on cases like mine to see what they do and I can keep it off my record, which is my main concern.. I need full time work.</p>
