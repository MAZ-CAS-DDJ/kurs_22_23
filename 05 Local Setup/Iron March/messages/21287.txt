	Religion is an interesting topic for me, I technically class myself as agnostic, but I've always had an interest in Paganism and what our ancient ancestors worshipped (Germanic/Norse Paganism, Scandinavian boat cult, Celtic mythology etc.), Christianity has never really interested me and seeing as Jesus was a Jew, and the bible is based on Jewish practices I don't think it has a place in Europe (same as the other Abrahamic religions). I've seen Esoteric Hitlerism being spoken about here and also by people I know IRL, I haven't really done much research on it though, all I know is Miguel Serrano and Savitri Devi were Esoteric Hitlerists. So overall, I'm an agnostic (I hate Atheism do to the fact it's members are usually leftist neck beard scum) but have an interest in learning about the ancient religions of our people.

	Could you recommend me any books/websites which dealÂ with Esoteric Hitlerism?
