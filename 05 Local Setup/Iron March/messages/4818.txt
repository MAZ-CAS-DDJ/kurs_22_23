<p>Ok, i will take you up on this. please give objections to the following. basic arguments I want to keep this kind of light. just so we know where we both stand. Don't be suprised is I am slow to reply or maybe don't as the shower of shit we face right now is endless.</p>
<p>It is very true that the fedoras claim to hate religion, but there is every indication that they are one and they are practicing a form of supremacy like other movements (islam for example) - remember that protestant rapper who is against the church but pro jesus, it is like that. Have you ever heard of the 'zeitgeist' movement? It is a religion of internet 4chan fedoras - just take the time to listen over their stuff and tell me if that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_theology" rel="external nofollow">doesn't sound like this</a>.</p>
<p>My connundrum is where do you even start? Ok in reference to the last point, you will say - 'well that is catholics and they are fucked' (though most religions including islam have their own variant/version of communist jew bolshevik kult), but there are many that use your arguements that are part of different churches. Jacob is a good example, despite being a convert he is very committed to the orthadox church - but wants an alliance with catholicism and attacks protestants most of the time - like just as much as the enemy. From what  gathered from an actual catholic like tallyrand (as opposed to torren) they are supremist to a degree - and also exceptionalist. Racial undertones are subliminal at best - and with converts like torren, not going to do much good.</p>
<p>Biggest problem is that you have completely opposing chuches that demand complete adherence to doctrine - that from a nationalist view are all interchangable - we could either into the Prods, the catholics, the orthadox. We are no tied to a church. In the UK for example, though there are some parts of the county like Scotland and NI whee protestantism is tribal the churhc if england is a glorified community centre and the largest conservative religious movement among whites in england is traditional catholicism - mostly people who left the state church after being pissed off.</p>
<p>whatever you do - you are going to be out of touch with most christians because they tribally adhere to their own church values - the only way to expand is to pick off those that fell on the wayside or convert the public. Where I agree with the reigious strategy is the elite nature of how the group is formed with a really strong inner cohesian - but it has to be with th ultimate aim of encompassing a nation which the fascists were able to do with a doctrine that was not a formal religion, just very vague principles.</p>
<p>Religion is not compatible with instituting a totalitarian theocracy in a modern western country in which all but a tiny minority are genuine believers. The whole point is to repel and orthadox and catholiciam are not in any instance to be taken lightly and joining them requires enormous commitment and understanding on  a personal level. Orthadox for instance have an innitiation period lasting several months and test you to ensure you have beeen fully re-educated because 'everything you knew before was wrong'.</p>
<p>what I am saying is that religious conviction can't be faked - and that goes across all levels, right to the top. A nationalist who puts his race before his god (conceptually) is not as sincere as and believing as somebody who is solely religious.</p>
<p>as a strategy it doesn't seem feasible because there have been much better and more talented men, literally billions of golds, and genuine believers who have instigated what are called 'revivals' over the years - and none of them have suceeded in creating a mass movement.</p>
<p>the supremacy of religion as divinity and not directly joined with nationalism can cause it to steer off course which - just look at the way they have thrown all the religious fascists under the bus - in many cases while they were alive such as Charles Maurras.</p>
<p>we play the ball as it lies. Questions I want answered are - what are we actually working with here and how far can it realistically be taken.</p>
<p>Rockwell's Christian identity experiment bloomed, (though the 80's revival - the main one - came in the zionist pat robertson form).</p>
<p>Undersanding this it is worth reading a william Luther pierce novel called 'hunter' a more subtle prequel to the turner diaries</p>

<p>In this they try to turn christian identity into a mass movement - they suceed, and the kikes get royally fucked, but the motivations are insincere.</p>
<p>- this is my most fundamental problem - that your argument is for Nationalists to find religion for the ends of nationalism by its nature is problematic - because that is not genuine belief. Clarify what is being advocated there.</p>

<p>“Harry took the Bible back from Oscar and flipped rapidly through the pages. “Here it is, in Matthew, chapter 27. Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, is trying to deal with a mob of Jews who want Jesus to be killed for violating Jewish law. Pilate wants to turn Jesus loose, but the mob, which is being egged on by the Jewish rabbis and priests, demands his death. ‘Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do unto Jesus which is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified. And he said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified. So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man: see you to it. And all the people answered and said, His blood be on us and on our children.’</p>
<p>“That’s pretty clear language, but a few years ago the Jews began complaining about it, because a small minority of the host population in this country and in Europe still took Christianity seriously— and they took at face value the Jews’ acceptance of collective responsibility for Jesus’ death. It resulted in anti-Semitism, the Jews said. So they demanded that the Christian churches change their teaching on that subject. And the churches did it! Now they all say that Matthew was wrong, that it was really the entire human race which was responsible for Jesus’ death, not just the poor, blameless, loveable Jews.</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>that— you could partly reprogram the herd— by changing the plots of the soap operas and the biases of the talk-show hosts, by reworking the dialogue and being careful about the complexions of the characters in the animated cartoons for the kiddies, by telling your anchormen when to sneer and when not to while they’re reading the evening news. Of course, you’d still need to give the majority of the people a good kick in the ass to make them break a lot of the bad habits they’ve picked up.”</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>During the last 50 years or so, however, its subversive, anti-Western tendencies have come to the fore again, and today it ranks right up there with the mass media and the Federal government as one of the principal agents of racial destruction. It is a religion of equality, of weakness, of regression and decay, of surrender and submission, of oblivion. If our race survives the next century it will only be because we have gotten the monkey of Christianity off our backs and have found our way to a genuinely Western spirituality again. The Jews may claim Jesus as one of their own if they wish, but in the long run I hardly believe that we will consider ourselves in their debt because of it.</p>
<p>“As for Marx, including him in their famous foursome is really a bit of impudence on their part. There’s absolutely no doubt about his Jewishness; he came from a family of rabbis. And there’s no doubt that he has had an effect on the Western world: his followers have murdered more of our people than anyone else in history— 30 million in Russia alone. Worse, they’ve usually been selective in their murder, deliberately killing off the best elements of our race, because those have been the elements most resistant to Marx’s nutty theories. Are we supposed to be grateful to the Jews for that? “Marx’s doctrine is as anti-Western as Jesus.’ It too was designed to appeal to the dregs of Western society, the worst elements among us, and to pull down the best and the strongest to their level. To the Jews he may be a great man, but as a system builder, a political theoretician, he was a zero. Communism has been a bust wherever it has been tried among White people. It simply isn’t workable, and it shows up its designer as a windy fraud</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Jesus was a religious reformer of exceptional ability and charisma, if we judge him by the supposed record of his life and teachings in the New Testament, but the religion founded by his followers certainly wasn’t a Western religion. It gained a foothold among the slaves and other alien elements of the demimonde in the decaying Roman Empire, and then it was imposed on our Saxon ancestors by fire and sword. What it became during the thousand years since then certainly was colored by our own racial character, making it at times in the past rather different from the subversive creed used by Saul of Tarsus and his</p>
<p>successors to undermine the power of Rome.</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>Saul, do you know anything about the Christian Identity doctrine?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, a little. I read a piece in the Sunday <em>New York Times </em>a few weeks ago about the people who follow that line. And I’d heard about them a couple of times before that. They’ve taken the basic Fundamentalist doctrine and turned it around. They teach that we are the ‘chosen’ people, and the Jews are impostors. The people of the Old Testament were really Aryans instead of Semites. And the Jews’</p>
<p>god— they call him ‘Yahweh’— made his special covenant with our ancestors, not the Hebrews, or something like that. The people at the <em>New York Times </em>really hate their guts— call them neo-Nazis andeverything else.”</p>
<p>“Okay, good. I read the same article you did, but I’ve done a little research since then. I read</p>
<p>everything about them I could find in the library, which wasn’t much, and I even wrote to one of their churches and got some of their literature. The really important thing about them is that they are having pretty good success in recruiting conventional Christians. They are strongest in rural areas. A lot of farmers in the Midwest have bought their line. They’ve grown a lot in the last few years, despite the fact that they have no mass medium for their message. I’m convinced that the only thing holding them back is that all of their leaders and spokesmen are working-class people who aren’t sophisticated enough to compete with the big-time Christian hucksters like Caldwell. On a one-to-one basis, though, they seem to be doing all right, and I’m sure it’s because their doctrine has a powerful appeal to Fundamentalists.”</p>
<p>“The reason they can’t recruit anyone but uneducated hicks is that their doctrine is crazy,” Harry chimed in. “I’ve actually met and talked to one of them. He drove a truck for the company I was with before I went to the Pentagon. They have this completely nutty version of history, which no one who’s paid attention in his high school history class can believe.”</p>
<p>“Crazier than the doctrine of Transubstantiation or the Immaculate Conception?” Oscar quickly came back. “Do you think that people who believe Jesus walked on water and rose from the dead can’t accept a nutty version of history?</p>
