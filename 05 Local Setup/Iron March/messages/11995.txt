<p>Ever since I listened to Natures Eternal Religion during the summer of 2015 much of Ben Klassen`s "philosophy" has stayed with me. I would indeed appreciate being put in touch with an English representative. The situation throughout all Europe is sliding with such rapidity now that I fear time is definitely no longer on our side. Unless something can be done to halt the infractions against our borders and the populace brought to their senses I truly fear for our future. A weak, unarmed, untrained, force, lacking in organisation and unity make the result of any "clash" uncertain in it`s outcome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for responding, I hope you will be able to help me to hopefully help myself in order that I may help my people!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In strength and Brotherhood,</p>
<p>Paul.</p>
