<p>I am on the charges of stealing, but being brought in on failure to appear due to being in the hospital. They will almost forsure release me(like 99%) again. I brought myself into the hospital to get meds that work for me and I got a doctor who works properly with me and is very good. Klonopin has made me much better. I won't share that info, obviously. I'll help set up a torchat network and such for us, and even maybe a national action site on tor for members with a secure login and such, even before the UK. I want to do the same thing as you know with the core members you and Alex pick out, so start planning that list soon.</p>
