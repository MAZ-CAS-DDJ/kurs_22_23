<p>I am interessed in knowing more about your economical philosophy. You mentionned that you were in favour of laissez-faire economics, but with governement regulations and you also described yourself as a keynesian. It is overall most contradicting. I would like to know more about the details, or of the grand lines, of your economical position, if you have time.</p>
