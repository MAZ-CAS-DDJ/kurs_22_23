	Sorry man I have been crazy busy over the past few days- had a competition and stuff.

	You are welcome to come along today if you like. It isn't really a big deal to tell you where we meet, honestly. We talk loud enough that any jew spies would be well aware of what we're talking about haha!

	Nothing sinister going on, just a few mates meeting at the German Arms at roughly 5:30Â
