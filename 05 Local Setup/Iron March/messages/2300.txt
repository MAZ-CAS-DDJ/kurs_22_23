<p>an admin(benjemin) sent me a message saying that you and i couldnt duke it out in the arena so lets do this in the wasteland, agreed?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I know what he said, because I'm on a call with him right now. The Admins all agreed I won the debate, that's why it's useless to do it in the debate duel thread.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>alright, you don't want a debate, fine. but from this moment on i will not respond to you directly or take you seriously in any matter, i was trying to have a civil arguement between you and i on this forum but since that is too much, fine.</p>
