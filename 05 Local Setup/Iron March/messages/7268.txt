<p>Parties are a regular thing here, there's shitloads of bars and clubs in San Cristobal - as I said the political climate here lately is tense even in a middle class area like this so there are a lot of fights too which get out of hand a lot lol, it's all good fun even when it's taken so seriously. People used to fight and kill over drugs more here - now its politics.</p>
<p>Petrol is cheap so travel across the country is awesome and I'll probably be taking a few days out starting from early this morning to travel out to a few national parks. If you love nature you'd love this country. It's not hard to see why the NatSocs loved everything about South America - it has a healthy level of racism, is not afraid to use violence but its population is humble at the same time. The environment is just brilliant too. They don't seem hung up over self-made western issues with things like fracking either and they acknowledge it as cleaner for the environment, more productive and efficient. A lot of prosperity can also be made if you're inclined to go into these energy sectors.</p>
<p>San Cristobal is one of the more affluent cities here and is where a lot of people have made it big down here.</p>
<p>There's not as much LSD here as there is mescaline and other psychedelics like shrooms but they're still good enough. Steroids are also available in abundance.</p>
<p>Plenty of sun, enough rain (certainly this month), smoking hot babes, great environment - it's a real man's paradise. It's what North America could be if it wasn't filled with pseudo-puritans, fatasses and people who only get up to work and do nothing else.</p>
