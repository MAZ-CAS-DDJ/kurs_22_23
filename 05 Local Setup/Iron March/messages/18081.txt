	My house is here its not that bad the weather is nice its warm unlike anywhere further north, there's like no faggots just blacks and rednecks , no Muslims where I am and barely any Mexicans just on the yard work and construction crews.

	My final class starts Monday it looks like a load of shit for all the citations and paper bullshit , the only consolation is I might get to write about Rockwell so there's that. I have no respect for people with Phds in social sciences. I've grown to hate my choice for my degree but I'm not smart enough to do math and science.
