<p>Good advice. Whitaker's book seems really relevant to me personally- less than a month away from receiving a post-graduate qualification so I have experienced a lot of this shit firsthand (probably been guilty of a little over-intellectual wankery myself now &amp; then too). Grabbed some Joyce articles too, extremely well-written. Pretty clear example of someone with a brain yet who wasn't afraid to express themselves clearly- or get their hands dirty.</p>

<p>Not sure if you've been in a university environment, but cultural Marxism's pushed <em>hard</em> nowadays, sociology &amp; anthropology courses are especially guilty of it, and it is working. I lost count of the number of times I heard (often very young) students say- "I am ashamed of being Australian" or "Australian identity is that we <em>have</em> no identity." Right-wing students learn to keep their mouths shut, and the main skills you develop are- find out your lecturer's prejudices first, then cater to them with wanky jargon; no critical thinking required. <a href="https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/qed/2013/10/colonised-classroom/" rel="external nofollow">Couple</a> of <a href="http://jimball.com.au/features/culture_wars_in_school.pdf" rel="external nofollow">articles</a> on this in an Aussie context if you're interested.</p>

<p>Shared that video with a couple of others, ashamed to say I never give much thought into looking into the actual research used to back 'change advocacy' or whatever (shows the value of a uni education &amp; automatically equating intellectualism with authority, definitely need to read Whitaker). Insidious the way it's being used, makes you aware how clever &amp; pervasive these attack strategies are. I'll keep my eyes &amp; brain open now, ta.</p>
