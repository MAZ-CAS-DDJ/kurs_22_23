<p>Thanks for the reading material, fella! Don't be offended if I don't include all of these on the bookshelf, since I think there's already an Evola thread and I don't want to go over ground other folk have trodden; but they're certainly going into my personal collection; and I intend to post at least one or two on PDFy once I'm done reading 'em.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
