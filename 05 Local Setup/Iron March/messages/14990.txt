	Alright, it hadn't occurred to me that you might be having technical difficulties. But yeah of course when I say intellectual I mean in the warrior-poet kind of way. As for what I would plan to do it would mostly be writing polemical papers (maybe books) arguing for and advocating for Fascism, also papers that would argue against democracy and communism as well. I have also always dreamed of forming a Student Nationalist League however I guess as a professor I wouldn't be able to do that :( Basically to combine my polemical academic work and real life activism.
