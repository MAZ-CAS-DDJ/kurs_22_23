			I don't know what to think of Manson I haven't done enough serious research to have an opinion. I know one National Socialist who told me that Manson is his personal idol and that Manson didn't really kill anybody, it was the Jewish controlled media that painted it that way. I wouldn't be surprised if that were true.<br /><br />

	Manson did nothing wrong. Plenty of people on here like him. <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/14300-grand-giant-sol/&amp;do=hovercard" data-mentionid="14300" href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/14300-grand-giant-sol/" rel="">@Grand Giant Sol</a> knows quite a bit. If you wanna ask him about it, he is Sol#4804 on discord.

	Siege should be required reading for the 21st century national socialist.
