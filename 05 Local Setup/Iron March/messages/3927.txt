<p>It seems like everywhere liberalism and globalism are taking over the minds of the youth. I don't personally know any other Fascists here in Australia but there is a group based in a bigger city than mine calling themselves nationalist Alternative. I am thinking of joining them.</p>
<p>It's good to hear that there are many nationalists in Bulgaria. As for Russia I like Putin. I think he is a strong leader.</p>
<p>In a couple of years time I will find myself with a large sum of money and I'd like to visit another country., Would you suggest I come to Bulgaria?</p>
