			In the post-USSR countries and mine incl. (even though not part of the union) we have this interesting phenomenon. Since 1944-1945 our countries were absolutely dominated by socialism/communism. Yet that, in one way or another, perserved the sanity of our people. Sadly, the cultural marxism that is enforced on the whole western world will have quite the opposite effect.<br /><br />
			It is understandable. In fact, yesterday, I watched a video called why Women destroy nations by Black Pigeon speaks. The author explained that women, due to their sensitivy, empathy are overall likely to adopt agendas that are spread in mass media to fit in. And also due to the fact women are more emotional and less rational they are likely to support traitorous movements like BLM, the refuge conflict and the feminism. Pure psychology. Sadly, the poisoning of women's minds was dealt satanically precise in large ammounts so when you see one that is willing to settle, manage the household and so on in contradiction to the drunken sluts - you can be sure that you've found a precious gem.

			Pff. Daily basis ? We got one per year and everytime there is a counter one, but the policemen pigs are heavily guarding it with water cannons and so on. The degenerates managed to gather 400-500 people, mostly foreigners, antifas and the other useful idiots. Luckily, our universities here are still not infiltrated with leftist propaganda and those morons only occupy Psychology, Social studies and other more or less useless degrees.

	Huh. Why did you survive so strongly, culturally, if you were dominated so heavily by Marxists? I have a lot of family in Russia, and it seems a lot more stable and less degenerate than the West too. They have some problems, their youth culture has a lot of this uber-promiscuous '70s disco thing which is probably an import from Western Europe. And they're extremely oligarchical. But they don't tolerate social breakdown and don't seem to have even in the communist days, so I'm very curious.<br /><br />
	I'd agree with that view of us, for the record. Women (even me) tend to be natural followers, we'll mostly go along with whatever view is popular. I can mostly thank culture shock, going from 90% white and stable Medford OR to super-liberal SJW paradise Berkeley CA for waking me up out of the brainwashing. Women also tend to be more left-wing, yeah, we have that nurturing instinct. That can be good economically, it means international capitalism gone rampant and destroying any shred of human dignity hard-working people have doesn't sit well with us. That was another part of my wake-up call. On the other hand, it means we're usually pro-LGBTQAWXYZ and minority grievance movements unless we see it as directly threatening our families. On the refugee crisis in Europe, I've seen a lot of comments from even liberal women I know though, because it legitimately is starting to threaten their loved ones personally.<br /><br />
	Our universities are dominated by leftist propaganda. I mean, it's worst in the humanities and social sciences, which is a shame because nothing should be more celebratory of our heritage than classes like History and English. But those mostly involve attacking "dead white men" instead. And even my biology class involved race-mixing propaganda, human interracial couples and studies on the "attractiveness" of their kids were used as an example of genetic "hybrid vigor." It's times like this that I sort of wish I were a fundamentalist Christian, at least their colleges are dedicated to teaching (even if their views on things like evolution are crazy) rather than pushing political views.
