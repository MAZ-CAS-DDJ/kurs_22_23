	I don't see how the two are separate because they are interconnected. What one does, affects the other. The Alt-Right agitates the JLeft that provides the fuel for the building race war that the AW/IM are banking on. The difference between an Alt-Right an a AM/IM is belief a more peaceful alternative. The AR are trying to affect electoral politics for favorable legislation for whites. The AM/IM don't believe real change is achievable through electoral politics and are instead preparing for the great happening
