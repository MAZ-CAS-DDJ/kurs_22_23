<p>I think a lot of it is going to boil down working with whatever we have, I mean the PNW thing is a mess but its a working mess, KoA may be the same thing. I should keep working on reaktion but I don't "feel it" so to speak. Our biggest set back is we're internet based and you, me, and Joe as well as millions of other people out there pretty much proved its a dead-end. You have to break yourself of the, "if I build it, they will come" mentality.</p>
<p>Glad you found your way to the Orthodoxy though.</p>
