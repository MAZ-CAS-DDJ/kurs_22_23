	Maybe Slavros too (I don't know if I already showed you that, but guess what he made a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8rQYDsb.png" rel="external nofollow">calculation</a> on roughly 2 months ago), but first of all I have to speak with the AW about you, then ask Baranyi if he knows similar minds around Kurdistan you could meet in the future, and my comrades on how can folks like us organize. They say Zeiger gone full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIPbzVj3-ow" rel="external nofollow">alt-Right</a> but I'm not sure about that and if he did, than that's a huge argument in the favor of the alt-Right.
