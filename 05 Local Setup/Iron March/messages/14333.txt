	I'm sorry you had to deal with it too. I'm glad you got to a good place with him before he passed. My mom, I see her sometimes, we live close by, but we can't talk about my dad. She says he abused her, I say anything that went on was mutual. From what I saw, she was just as guilty.

	AND I'm 20. Yeah, split religion in the family is fucking tough, my dad and i were hardcore catholic, my mom was always straying towards the easy protestantism, and when she left my dad and my sister came out as bisexual they started attending an "affirming church"... I think the hardest part for me was watching ,y dad be so alone and watching the family splinter and abandon him. Did yours stick by him, besides the sister?
