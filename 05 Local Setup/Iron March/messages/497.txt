<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m only slightly acquainted with you and your work. I did read your articles in Attack the other night and found myself agreeing with most of what you’d written. I’m worried that too many on the far-right are softening their position to the point where they’re no more than liberals concerned over immigration; so it was refreshing to read something uncompromising and explicitly rightist.</p>
<p>I know next to nothing about the British Integralist Party, by the way, other than the fact that you’re not an electoral party.</p>
<p>Insurrectionist.</p>
