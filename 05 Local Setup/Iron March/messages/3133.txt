<p>Hi Sean,</p>
<p>I am not sure if you will stay, so I wanted to catch you as somebody willing to do what you did has a lot of drive, and I thought it worth dropping a line where it is appriciated. I am a fascist, and I keep a lot of material if you ever need anything to look at and am something of a walking library. Let me know if you are interested. </p>
<p>I think we have a mutual friend through a welsh activist usually called something like Alex14</p>
<p>If you use skype we have a pretty active skypegroup</p>
