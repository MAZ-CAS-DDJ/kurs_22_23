<p>I in no way doubt your love for the Ahlul Bayt good sir, the hanafis of the region have a long history of loving them. And in no way do I think that being Sunni excludes one from loving them and learning from them. The Hanafi school is actually one of my favorite madhabs alongside the Maliki.</p>
<p>As for Christians in the order; there have always been Christian Sufis. The Rosicrucians were formed specifically because of the teachings brought back to Europe from the Sufis. People often times recognize haqq but do not wish to leave their customs or traditions of their people.</p>
