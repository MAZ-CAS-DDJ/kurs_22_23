<p>Nice, I got lucky being born with 2 nationalities, i can speak Dutch, French and English so that is enough for me</p>
<p> </p>
<p>About gaul, i used to be all about medieval France and i too have only recently gotten into deep studying of Gaul and the continental celts, It is a shame that most sources are either from greeks or romans who always tried to discredit them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm going to quote myself from elsewhere for this one not trying to be a tryhard historian or anything</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Roboto, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">The problem in France is not that people don't see the gauls as their anscestors because they do, the problem is that they are misinformed on their anscestors the French education system sees the gauls as barbarians who only became useful after being romanized/christianised or they are this weird egalitarian society that were just as degenerate as the (later)Greeks/Romans. while in truth they were not, they were advanced but still very much traditional, The only sources the education system uses are Greek and Roman sources that ofcourse tried to discredit the gauls, the gauls themselves could write but it was not allowed by the druids, they passed their religion and tradtions on trough the spoken word by the druids. the same druids that were killed and opressed by unhonourable romans, with the druids went all the real knowledge about gaul The gauls had better metal working than the romans and their calendar is more accurate than even the modern gregorian calendar. Their architecture/cities were not as great because they knew they did not need to create huge stone structures.</span>"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Furthermore the roman description of the gallic gods is EXACLTY the same as those for the germanics and norse "mercury" being the most important a.k.a Odin/Wotan/Lugus</p>
