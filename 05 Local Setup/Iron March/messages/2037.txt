<p>"Well im a member of organization and know first hand how hard is to made people to believe that you are right and something might be changed... I mean they know you are right but they lost faith in democracy (i mean its principles voting and stuff they like someone just take the power and made the things right) and there is the problem at least here. You must made him vote for you and keep voting for you that you at least have the chance to ruin the system from within... And that is hard when the people hate politics and everything with it..."</p>
<p>Politics is much worse here, you have to use a million pesos just to persuade people to vote for you, mainly because you have to give them money. </p>
<p>"Man if you talk like that our enemies are win.. They want us to stop reproducing and become sufficient and import imigrants  and became mixed and stuff... We need time to fight this enemy greatest of all and the childrens is the future and every nation must secure its future... Well i know the hardships and know that is sux to live in pooverty but that will made them strong.. Like the mongols. They leave Mongolia naked but strong and conquer the World...."</p>
<p>Agreed. Also, it is best to teach to the youth the importance of keeping the country from foreigners who wish to fuck things up in the country the foreigner visits. Reproducing is not bad, as long as the offspring have quality, and one has the resources to do so, unless the state supports big families. </p>
<p>BTW, what do you think of immigrants who work hard and assimiliate in your society? (he is black/asian/whatever, but he speaks Bulgarian, and so on, basically Bulgarianized)</p>
