	Haha, there's always a positive. I get that too sometimes. I've managed to limit my video game playing to near zero but I still do generally enjoy it and don't sperg out on it too hard.

	I have found that as I've gotten older I've had a little less interest but honestly I think that also just has to do with the state of the industry and increasing knowledge of programming and general development. I can at least appreciate them in multiple ways and not just the entertainment value from playing it.

	Not related, but you off the meds now? I remember you mentioning you were getting off anxiety pills or something like that. Really good stuff if you're going clean, those things honestly don't do any good for anyone. The way to cure anxiety or any of those sorts of 'psychological' disorders is just living a healthy lifestyle. Eating decently, exercising and (even in the horrible modern world) socializing and going outside, just not to degenerate parties and clubs etc.
