<p>I'm outside of Tallahassee. My current living situation is temporary but I'm probably moving to somewhere near Madison county, maybe Monticello. I don't have a Skype account and off the top of my head I'm not sure if I can even run Skype on my Linux setup (probably, if I had to). Have you ever used a Tox client for video calls?</p>
