<p>William, if I am not mistaken, you are/used to be a Nihilist. May you post in the Morality thread? Even though my way of explanation might be flawed, this subject is as idiotic as a debate regarding the existence of God. Neither side can prove their point. You could give an ultimatum with your opinion, be it for or against them.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
