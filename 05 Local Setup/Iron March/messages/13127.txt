	Did you still want my email , I'm not always here but if you want to talk its easier to reach me at. I deleted my facebook a few years ago I never really used it. Well i have no idea what he's telling you but I feel better telling you this because I hated knowing all this the drugs but  , also he talked a lot about you it kinda freaked me out so I feel better letting you know.
