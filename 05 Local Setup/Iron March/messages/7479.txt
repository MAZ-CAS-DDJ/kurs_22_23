<p>Sorry for the late response about the nationality issue.</p>
<p>I forgot that ip board deletes the whole conservation instead of individual posts.</p>
<p>I like my inbox being clean.</p>
<p>Personally I am having a positive opinion about organic nationalities and people in Hungary. We don't have much of a conflict of interest with ethnic germans or slavs of various kind.</p>
<p>Hungarian nationalism even Hungarism was a kind of accepting one.</p>
<p>The current currents are influenced by "nazism" a lot but not even they have anything against "svabs" or "toths".</p>
<p>They don't talk much about small nationalities/peoples beside Russins.</p>
<p>Of course the hungarians over the border get the most attention.</p>
<p>"Csángós" and "Székelys" in Romania are the highest priority for them.</p>
