	Hey, hope everything is going well for you in Afghanistan.<br /><br />
	Just a quick update, there were some setbacks but we are still in the game. The only thing that has changed is instead of starting work in the summer we will start in the fall, tentatively of course. Everything else is as expected, we are new to this so we are slowly feeling our way instead of rushing it, and of course hardly anything goes exactly as planned.
