<p>G'day Lads,</p>
<p>I've got Kalash onto making up some Posters, to improve upon the two i haphazardly made, since I want them to be Australian IM chapter material I may aswell get some ideas on how to improve those posters to pass on to Kalash, from you lads. He has asked for some images, so if you guys think you know of better ones than I've used or are somewhat hesitant on using the Anzac motif than let us know, I just googled those images, sure we could come up with better layout/slogan's/images. </p>
<p>Cheers</p>
