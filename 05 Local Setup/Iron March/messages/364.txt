<p>I'm irreligious but I have recently had some wavering sympathies towards Christianity. The issue I take with Christian Identity style christianity is that it is based in the same kind of pseudo-mythology as British-Israelism is and has no basis in the face of genetic evidence. How would you get around the fact that Christianity is inherently Jewish and for the Jewish people? Do you just throw out the Old testament?</p>

<p>I don't mean this to sound offensive or ignorant. I'd like to get a Christian perspective on this because I'm genuinely interested.</p>
