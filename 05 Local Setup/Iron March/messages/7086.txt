<p>FUCK. I wrote an epic message and it was deleted. Pffffff....right will try again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah I'm not opposed to drugs, I've written shit loads about the elite use of Soma and cannabis and mead etc. by the Aryan tribes and cultures, especially Vedic Soma, Persian Haoma and Greek Ambrosia etc. Sigurd has a whole chapter on an Aghora style use of European hallucinogens.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And I know Jack Don, he went to the Wolves compound a few days ago for Summer Solstice, I think he's writing an article about it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for my own experience, fuck's sake, typing this again....I actually came to Iron March because Plowshares mentioned his experience on acid of a mechanical Mussolini stomping cities and I told him about my own experience a few weeks ago when I smoked a substance I won't name (N...S....A). I basically closed my eyes and was swamped with images of Aryan girls being raped and tortured, it peaked in intensity and I saw a wolf coming towards me out of the mirk howling, slowly I realised the howling was my own voice and I began to cry, then at that moment the wolf morphed into Hitler and smashed all the torture scenes away, all there was in the entire universe was Hitler's grinning face, pure and perfect, like a battering ram and it smashed me to bits. I was a wreck, totally dumbstruck, perfect religious awakening experience. I told Plowshares and he told me to come here, as jackboot shamanism is a thing <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>And the profile pic, yeah I try to do most of my rituals in balaclava and camo, bit like a Roman in his helmet and armour for a ritual to Mars I think. It was when we did the blot to hallow my new training area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh yeah and if there isn't one already, someone should start a thread on fitness, I can then discuss my ideas without being the twat who started the thread hahaha</p>
