<p>If you have 30, 000 members, why was nothing done? Revolutions have been achieved with less manpower.</p>
<p>I'd love to help the council if I could, though I'm not a full on creator, ive flirted with the ideology and am based in the UK. However, I am devoted to National Action here, and not sure if time would permit active work. But I am building a project which teaches natural living skills and my partner and I shall be orgamjsmg camps. If a creativity movement existed in the UK, I'd be more than glad to train up a few guys in living self sufficiently and they could be to know other groups which would be there and present a good image.</p>
<p>I offer my regards, brother.</p>
