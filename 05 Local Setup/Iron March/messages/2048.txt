<p>The Futurism part makes sense to me. It's Actual Idealism which absolutely breaks my mind. I have little experience with philosophy and particularly the vocabulary of philosophy, as I mentioned, and I tried reading your post on Fascism as the conclusion of Actual Idealism (interestingly, the 4th result on a Google search for "actual idealism") with no success. I do not understand it at all, and even less do I understand its implications for politics.</p>
