	This post helps sum up his worldview. He defends school shooters and then claims that a tranny freak did nothing wrong by turning a gun on three random people. I know we might not like lemmings, but surely it's a bit far to claim that Stair did nothing morally wrong?

	I did try to engage him in conversation, as you'd suggested. However, he chose to misinterpret the post and then proceed to ignore my comments. I've seen the same thing happen when others attempt to talk with him and it usually ends with Николајевић claiming that his opposition is a moderate and relies on their emotions.

	I've respected your opinions since joining IM and I'm interested to see your opinion on this. Would you agree with his criticisms of organised activist groups? Or his moral views points?
