	Silav Heval. It's good to meet you.

	Yes, it's true, I am Kurdish and a fascist. Unfortunately the only other one you'll encounter for now, and I'm very surprised to see you. I never thought that would happen. But this forum, while a useful source of info and material about fascism, is not a place for us to interact with fascists from other groups. Hence why I hardly post here and why I've made my profile look trollish. Our nation is not respected by the mainstream intelligentsia of establishments around the world, let alone by fascists, who value exactly that which we are not, have never possessed and never had the opportunity to possess : glorious empires with mighty armies and a sublime culture. Kurds are weak, divided, backward, without a history of might and acccomplishment, and generally not very respectable to someone, fascist or otherwise, who finds himself at the top of human civilisation - a member of a nation that builds nukes and sends humans into space, for example, while we fight on mountain tops with AK's. Someone like that isn't going to think we have any rights and defend them for us. Interaction with outsiders will only ever demoralise us, for whatever their attitude toward us may be, it will reflect our weakness. We are truly on our own, but we can turn our desolation among human civilisation to our advantage by creating a value system that answers to absolutely nothing and no one but us. I want the Kurds to able to accept everything, true or false, that our detractors say about us, and still find the arrogance to spit in their faces.

	As for info about myself, I have to disappoint you. I'm an assimilated Kurd - my family forgot their language and had nothing to pass on to me. However, while I've lost my language &amp; culture I am at least not defiled with Turkish blood, unlike many other assimilated 'Kurds' and which makes my lost identity worth regaining. I'm learning Kurmanji right now with the materials I can find and two informal tutors.

	I don't think a lot of Kurds have semi-fascist tendencies and are simply confused or not committed enough. Mainstream Kurdish discourse is full of talk about humanity, equality, freedom, democracy, and so on. That doesn't point to a problem of degree but of fundamental values and ideas. Kurds mentally respond to their problems in the textbook way of a slave in Nietzsche's conception of masters and slaves. Dictatorship is bad because Saddam was a dictator. Racism is bad because Turks are racist against us. Force, violence and killing are bad because we're the victims of these acts. And if we don't shun everything that our enemies represent, there is no point to Kurdistan because we deserve it for our 'goodness', and we're not made for doing what the enemies do. That is the way most Kurds think, based on my observations.

	With that being said, I have noticed a rising number of Kurds with a radicalised nationalist sentiment, even if they don't consider themselves fascistic and are not familiar with, or would fully agree with fascist concepts.  Their numbers are small and the general trend is barely noticeable, but I do notice it because I, like yourself, am highly attuned and on the look-out for it. You can notice it when one out of 20 Kurds on e.g. Twitter makes statements about Turks, Arabs or Persians that reveal a hatred of their existence, and not just of the actions of their governments, as per our political correctness. For the moment these radical Kurds are just individuals drifting on the internet, acting on their own accord, but they'll occasionally cross paths like we have on this forum and proceed to work together. It's a slow process but one that could lead to the emergence of an organised movement in time.
