	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	I also live in the Boston area. I'm very new to this site, but I've been trying to find an activist group for awhile now. I am also a big fan of national action. I'm going to ask about the atomwaffen group as well, but I just thought I'd say hello. It's not so often I find other Boston inhabitants around the NS community. <br />
