	Thank you for the link! I will do some research. No saw some of the stuff on here, butnit looked like mostly young people, which is good, but, at 36, I would give off kind of a Chomo vibe.

	As far as the distinction, and keep in mind, this is party doctrine, and less my opinion, but...
</p>

<p>
	1) An American can be a fascist without being an "American Fascist" because of the doctrine of integralism found within fascism. While we follow the basic doctrinal structure of Mussolini, we don't copy him because he was not American, so the specifics of Italian fascism might not apply in America , for instance, we would be hard pressed to have our leader declared head of state by the king of America. We also would not follow Hitler for the same reason.

	2) in addition to the doctrinal differences between each fascist movement,  there is a strong sense of nationalism. In Hitlers case, he was right, Germany is for Germans, and Italy is for Italians, and America is for Americans. However, to a small extent, people are ethnically Italian, or not. And, to a much Greater extent, someone is either German, or they are not. Jews, Gypsies, Slavs, etc, are their own ethnic groups, who already have a corner of the world carved out for them, so, a person cannot be Jewish and German at the same time. But, as much as I may personally not be a fan of, let's say, black people, I can't say that they are not American, because I am no more ethnically American than they are. The American nationality is non ethnic, so, no ethnic nationalism!, could possibly be American Nationalism as well. If you are an American Nationalist (which we hold to be a prerequisite for being an American Fascist) then you are fighting in defense of Americans, which includes many ethnic groups, but one nation.

	Personally, I don't see white pride as a problem. The motorcycle club I joined doesn't allow blacks, so I'm definitely not a fan of the rainbow coalition, but I don't claim that black Americans aren't real Americans.

	Fascist salute brother.
