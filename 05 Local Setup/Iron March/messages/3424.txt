<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am not interested in any of those two RPGs to be honest, sorry. Both are not my cup of tea, especially 4th Edition. Maybe Star Wars d20 would be interesting, but I surely prefer Warhammer 40.000: Deathwatch on this one.</p>
<p>It depends on what kind of help you need, I can ask a friend of mine with who I happen to chat a lot about mechanics with.</p>
