<p>Life is good for now, I guess. A lot could be better if we sorted out the inefficiencies and weaknesses of our government (which recently collapsed after 20 years of almost uninterrupted rule), but when compared to the state of the rest of Southern Europe we're doing fairly well. Illegal Immigration is becoming a major problem here, but the E.U. and liberals in other countries are preventing us from handling it ourselves, so we are forced to keep the majority of them. I'm also fairly bummed out that we are giving so much power to private contractors and are liberalising our economy to such a large extent. </p>
<p>People here are very socially conservative and are more Nationalistic than most of the West (We have a strong Island Mentality and Catholicism is still very powerful here), but liberalism has been on a very slow rise as of late. I don't really know of any significant fascist movement here to be honest. Until 2008 we had a Nationalist movement known as Azzjoni Nazzjonali (National Action) but it was disbanded after the previous election. As of yet, people are still far too comfortable with their current situation and don't really feel the need to follow Nationalist movements or take to the streets, but I predict that sooner or later there will be an economic collapse or something else which would cause many to doubt our current parties (similar to what is happening in Greece but probably not to such an extent). Speaking of parties, there are two main parties which constitute about 97% of our electorate: The Nationalist Party (Socially Conservative/Neoliberal (with regards to the economy) and the Labour Party (Slightly more liberal/Social Democrats). They and too many of their followers bicker like children and argue over trivial shit. It's very petty to be honest.</p>
