<p>I'm French and I live in Montreal. I do translations from English into French. I currently work on a book of a nationalist French historian ; thus, this time, I have to translate from French into English and consequently I'm looking for a native English speaker to revise the final text in English. It amounts to picking out possible big mistakes. The remuneration is modest but real. If you're interested, please contact me here.</p>
<p>kind regards,</p>
<p>S.</p>
