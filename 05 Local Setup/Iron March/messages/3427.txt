<p>I do have skype and I know how the d100 system works in that regard, the idea is to try to change it so if you need a 35 you roll 35 or higher, like with the d20 system. There is a reason for this it has to do with a feature I've created for the game called Knowledge, Concealment, and Security.</p>
<p>I can go more into this later if you want.</p>
<p>Also speaking of skype, we have an IronMarch skype group if you are interested.</p>
