<p>I'm just curious about your statements on Khazars. I'm part Tatar myself and would (theoretically) be closely related to a Khazar but no genetic testing has proven this.</p>
<p>Beyond that, keep on what you're doing.</p>

<p>I don't have a problem with Khazars or Tatars.</p>
<p>I'm just amused by the<em> assumption</em> that all Jews are Khazars... Even though they come from many backgrounds.</p>
<p>...Are you Jewish?</p>
