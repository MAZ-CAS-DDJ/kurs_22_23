<p>Besides the one in my profile I love those as well. How on earth it took me so long to discover the bible was so fucking cool I don't know; it was probably the KJV version which didn't help.</p>
<p>The great thing is that the bible doesn't even have to contradict evolution (even though there are other theories) and the passages like the one I just gave you are things people can really relate to.</p>
<p>I think Christianity is the greatest religion ever; what other religion tells you that there's a time to kill, hates Jews, rids the world of degenerates with floods, hates queers, is racist, authoritative, condemns femininity in men, has a work ethic (if you're a protestant) supports slavery AND allows you to drink alcohol? It's just a shame about the pre-marital sex issue, but I can see the logic to it.</p>
