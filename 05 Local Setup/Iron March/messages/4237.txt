<p>They seem like they were an alright group to be honest. Yugo fascism would be cool if the area wasnt such an almighty clusterfuck and when it comes to Yugo-nostalgia i love the Kings dictatorship rather than Titto. I just cant figure why the royalty were such dicks to people like these (they banned Zbor as well). And of course theres the argument that ORJUNA lacked a truly native yugoslav persona and was too fixated on the italian style of fascism with kike hating added in.</p>
