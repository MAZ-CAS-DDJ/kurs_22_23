<p>Honestly I Dont know more than a couple but that is because of the way we are structured. The church runs on a cell like structure. You have ministries run by reverends who maintain contact with other reverends. I started my ministry last June and I have 15 people. Reverend kyle in Texas has only a few people and yet reverend Logsdon has a ministry in bloomington Illinois and reverend nikolic is in charge of Chicago. So they have had to divide territory due to size. What I do know is Gavin in Cleveland Ohio teaches mma at a gym  and about a hour from him we have josh who is a youth member. We are growing this year alone we have printed 500 books.</p>
