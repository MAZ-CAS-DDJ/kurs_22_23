<p>Well it all depends. I am not as revolutionary as a lot of the people on here. American Blackshirt and I were talking and he said he thought the whole system had to be destroyed. I wouldn't go that far. I kind of view America as analogous to Rome. And right now, I feel like we are ripe for the transition from a Republic to an Empire, much in the same way Rome was. I think that, as Americans, we really need to be looking at our problems from a more national, as opposed to international, perspective. I know that diving into things like Evola, using Runes and paramilitary uniforms is all the rage with members but that will never fly in America, at least not with the majority of people. The two most successful fascist/authoritarian leaders in America were Huey Long and Father Charles Coughlin, both of whom appealed to Americans on a much more basic, effective level. </p>
<p>When it comes to actual action I am at a loss. I think trying to raise a third party from the ground up will not have any success unless there is an extremely popular candidate who defects to the party. For instance, the Bull Moose party had Roosevelt. We, at present, do not have that. I think that a combination of a Politcal Action Committee to try to elect strong centralist candidates coupled with a public think tank to spur discussion and get the wheels of the people rolling would be excellent ideas. Easier said than done obviously but all plans have to start somewhere. </p>
<p>Let me know your thoughts.</p>
