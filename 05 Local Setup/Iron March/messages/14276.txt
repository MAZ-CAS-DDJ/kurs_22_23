	I've always had this habit of stumbling into a certain topic and compiling exhaustive amounts of information on it. I honestly don't remember what I initially saw that sparked my interest. All I remember is it seeming like a relatively obscure topic that most people don't know a whole lot about, and that was enough for me.

	It's kind of a lost art; so far as I know, there aren't any written manuals on exactly how to do X Y and Z. I remember seeing something about an American Blacksmith's Association or something like that who have classes you can take, but it seemed like a case of "Pay us a bunch of money so we can teach you stuff you'd probably figure out on your own anyways."

	It's really a matter of trial and error, and of course learning from others that have been doing it longer than you have. You can learn how to do basic stuff with a little bit of google searching, Dave Canterbury has a pretty good video series about it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZLagqylZ3j7H2MEDrDTb7Dz6xVZeMRTt" rel="external nofollow">his JewTube channel.</a>
