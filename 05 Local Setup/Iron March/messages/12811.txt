	I hope so haha. Turns out I didn't, it's thursday. More time to study at least. And well there was a goddess among the germans called eostre,  I think that's the saxon name, who gave the name to the holiday. It always been presumed she was a fertility goddess and that explains alot of Easter symbolism but very little is known of her so nothing is too sure. She's only attested to by bede

	It's probably correct though, I mean why chocolate rabbits and eggs, jesus? I don't remember that part of paschal, and the whole egg painting thing always came off as very pagan to me

	He was a good man and good fascist, shame England never went the right way. I would've been interested in seeing a fascist england, would've been fun

	Yeah, I've overheard blacks in my area genuinely talking about starting an uprising and race war if trump wins. I sorta hope they do, if whites are too cowardly to make the first move a reaction will be the second best. It's funny how terrified they are at the very idea of having a white male president who isn't a weakling, you can really smell the fear in the cities.

	Lol maybe, caves tend to grow burning bushes for some reason. Pretty sure it was whenI was a kid and I lived in norcal with my dad,there was a mountain lion den in our area, fish and game eventually hunted them down with hounds because they were killing all the livestock around them. Well I had a few times I was sure a cat was stalking me and he some of our pets started getting killed too. I remember pretty clearly the first time I got sleep paralysis there was the shape of a mountain lion sitting on top of me and it's claws sank into my shoulders to keep me pinned and staring up at it.

	Yeahh, giant trees are pretty nice. In alaska the tundra and bogs means most of the trees in the heartland are kinda stumpy and warped but overgrown. The mountains make up for it. True but even poor people act like they own the world now, I blame celebrity culture and media on it. People see these rich, horrid and spoiled people propped up as idols and think that's what should be emulated, while scoffing at myths and history that were meant to teach behavior and morals. Yeah they're pretty nice. I do but it's been a while, moving around kinda messes up hunting licenses state to state lol. I didn't get to hunt in alaska unfortunately. My last year of high school I saw all sorts of shit that could traumatize a man. Have you ever seen those foxtails that kids stuff down their pants? Not sure if that's an American tradition but they were common by the time I was a senior and most of them were rainbow colored. It's some furry bullshit I'm sure

	Admittedly not much either, I've gone on graffiti and poster runs but I work alone usually. Don't know enough other fascists in the area, and the ones in socal are all pretty far away and I'm busy with other shit for now. I used to be a skinhead hoodlum if that counts for anything lol.

	I think that's true, even with petty things like media they make the bad guys cool almost on purpose. Well I studied everything as much as I could if I had interest in it, which was almost everything except math. The more I studied the second world War the more I realized how much bullshit the allies had conjured up and the crimes they committed against the germans and italians. Then I realized most Americans are german by blood and we're killing their own brothers in their own homeland, even Eisenhower is a damn german. Then I studied the nazis and their ideology themselves and realized they were right and did nothing wrong, and that nothing they said seemed to correlate to what I was taught in school. Our schools will just make shit up if the teachers don't know better, I wish I was kidding. One time in high school a girl asked "what's a prussian?" During ww1 lectures, our fat jew teacher said " well they were mixed race polish and Russians who were hated everywhere because of their heritahe, especially by germans" I almost fucking threw a desk at her, it's especially infuriating now that I know I'm basically prussian

	Those are all good things to be admired, save the childishness  haha. We all have flaws I suppose, even hitler did (he had mercy). Do you resemble her? Youre pretty if you do! If you dont I bet you're still pretty ha

	I guess he's better known as Herman the cheruscan, the germanic prince that rekt Rome so badly they never used the same 3 numbers for future legions. I sorta see him as the earliest incarnation of the same spirit that united our people when Frederick the great, Bismarck and hitler were around, since he managed to unite most of the major rhinish tribes for the attack.
