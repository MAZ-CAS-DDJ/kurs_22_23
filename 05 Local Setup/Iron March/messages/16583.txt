	I am in no way fearful of being labelled any of these things, but I do believe in a future where the truth becomes widespread and we can become a popular movement, as much as you might not want to, we are going to have to draw these people in one way or another, otherwise our movements will end up being defined by lone wolf shooters, which is the kind of future we should avoid.
