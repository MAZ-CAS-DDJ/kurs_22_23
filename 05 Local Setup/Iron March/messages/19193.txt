	So my thread was locked due to "Gay, drama starting thread, locked. @Vex pro-tip don't post discord chat logs that show you getting btfo"
</p>

	My intention was not to start drama, it was to shed light on an issue plaguing this movement, it just so happens that AtomWaffen Division has all of Muslims in the American Movement, by locking the thread you are effectively  destroying any chance of conversation that can take place and to truly reach a conclusion on this problem. So can you unlock the thread?
