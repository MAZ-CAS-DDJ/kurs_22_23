	I had some pictures of celtic crosses and wolfsangel from the few pro-ukrainian pictures and some fag had reported me. I believe it is not from my friends' list because those pictures were visible from anyone but nevertheless I plan on cleaning my profile from people who I don't care about.

	As of the cop, I am losing patience, haha. Taking casual walks with my official tracksuit (looking suspicious to get my id taken eventually) but still no luck. I noticed that the cops are there during the weekend (when I work) or after 21-22h. Continuing on the attempts though - taking the metro, doing a walk Â around the hood, relaxing and going back home. So trying to double the options :D
