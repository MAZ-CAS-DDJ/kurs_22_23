	1) The only structure that we really need for Fascism at the moment is the Truth. Which we can find comes from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.

	2) Nationalism and Fascism is and of itself a racial doctrine. It manifests in different ways like Mussolini and Hitler in their respective countries but for Americans the case is different. There is no such thing as an "American" ethnically, which means America is an artificial state and therefore cannot be Fascist, a Nation or Nationalist. Unless it's civic nationalism in which case it's total shit. That's what got us into this case in the first place. Who built this country? White people. Who is responsible for most of it's accomplishments? White people. So who are really "Americans", any race that lives here. That's nonsense, we must resolve to create an organic state, which is what a Fascist seeks to do because that is the only way a true nation can exist and make it one people. A Nation is a people. If you took away all the borders of Germany and erased its name off the map, there would still be Germans. But if you did that to America, there wouldn't be any Americans. But there exists a people who are the true Americans and those are the whites or WASPS of this country. The American Nationality does not exist, it's civic nationalism and artificial which is antithetical to Fascism.
