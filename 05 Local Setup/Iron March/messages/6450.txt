A meta-political movement, based on pure principles, seeking to create an international of the Right, an understanding that the economy is to be subservient to politics (not the other way around), and a desire to leave behind the idea of the nation-state and instead replace it with different forms of social organisation including regionalism, and the idea of empire. We’re also in agreement that whatever is developed must be in accordance with the native culture – both here and abroad.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">I suppose the next step is to branch out and actually find some like-minded Britons.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">Another point I’d like to make regarding vanguardism and meta-politics: this idea that the Left dominates the West’s intellectual sphere, and that this accounts for much or most of its influence. It’s therefore believed that the path to victory lies in competing with the Left intellectually and becoming the dominant force in the intellectual world. I agree that being the dominant force in this area is vitally important. But I don’t believe storming it through <em>better arguments</em> is possible. I think the trick would be to <u>equal</u> the Left intellectually whilst at the same time surpassing it in terms of important non-intellectual attributes. Targeting students for ‘conversion’, rather than their professors is paramount too. Imagine being a student on campus, and there are two rival groups of politically-charged students – both perfectly equal in intellectual respects. However, one group are all skinny/fat, wimps, crappily-dressed; and then the other are all muscular/athletic, tough, well-dressed. Who are you drawm to? That, I believe, is the key to meta-political success.</span></span></span></p>
