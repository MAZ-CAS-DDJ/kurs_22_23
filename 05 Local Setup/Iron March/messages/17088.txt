	I must say i'm enjoying it a lot as well as Mason's interviews iv been watching a bit of. While his praise for C.Manson and Tomato Joe is understood and fully right i'm not a fan of them, They used drugs and came off a little crazy but Mason himself is so well spoken and thinks so far ahead. I was told the book was "a good read but a bit LARPY" but i disagree, we have slim to no chance of taking our land back by election, but by siege is another story. Does he have any other books or compilations you would recommend once i finish this one?
