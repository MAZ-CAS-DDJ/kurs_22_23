<p>By revolution you mean a armed conflict? Sure we could do that even now but why? A enemy would come overthrow us and nothing would really change. It would be like getting elected and after your term a new person comes and replaces you. It would be better to change the very value system of the people then no armed force or political party could replace us. A religion blast for thousands of years political parties always change rarely maintain authority for over a life time. Militias maintain authority for even less time.</p>
