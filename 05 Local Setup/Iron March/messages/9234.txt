<p>I could but the problem is i don't have a PC right now, so im not gonna see how other people respond until i know i can contribute.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Theres been a few other ideas for community projects that haven't seen the light of day, so i'd nned to know i could do it on my own and then ask for help so it doesn't just become another aborted project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once i get around to getting a New one then i'll let you know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One thing i was thinking though is to contact the guys at Omniphi productions, their the ones that did Hellstorm and made a pretty kickass vids about GLR and Kai Murros.</p>
