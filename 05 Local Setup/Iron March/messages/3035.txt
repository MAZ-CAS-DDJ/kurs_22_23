<p>Good words on Ha'Shem. You would be interesting to drink a beer with. Assuming you drink. I prefer some form of more traditional Judaism. I am not a fan of people who say, "Well, I am a strict Atheist. But I strongly identify with Judaism." I find these people are common in Reform sometimes. I don't think all Reform are bad though. Sometimes it seems they give Jews a bad name though because they do not believe in God or Judaism, and therefore sometimes are Marxist, and still identify as Jews.</p>
<p>I admit I had a period I did not "believe" in God. But I still prayed to Him and worshiped as if he was real, and I tried to think what God would want, whether real or not.</p>

<p>My avatar was the symbol for the Teutonic Knights. Now it is of Werner Goldberg, a Jew in the Wehrmacht.</p>
