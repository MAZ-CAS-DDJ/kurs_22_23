<p>I rode my brother's bike some 20 miles on a flat tire... I've got some serious bruising but in enjoying the sore muscles.</p>
<p>Blue eyes are my favorite. Can't wait to have a little one of my own. Do you know how old she was? <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>The sound of rain at night is one of my favorite thing in the world. Hope to hear it with you sometime....</p>
