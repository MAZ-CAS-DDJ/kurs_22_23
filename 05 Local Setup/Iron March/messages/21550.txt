	G'day, could you please delete Hal's comment in:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-controller="core.front.core.autosizeiframe" data-embedcontent="" data-embedid="embed4553857215" scrolling="no" src="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/8289-ar-media-thread&amp;do=embed" style="height:214px;max-width:502px;"></iframe>

<p>
	It's a stupid meme and belongs in the meme thread, not the official one. I told him off for it.

<p>
	Accordingly could you also please delete the comments below it? They're off topic since the picture will be deleted.
