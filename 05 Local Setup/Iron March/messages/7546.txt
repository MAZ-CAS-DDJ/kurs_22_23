<p>It's ok, this all I understand!<br /><br />I knew you were a boxer, I didn't know about this club! Wow, that sounds awesome. Is it made up of a lot of fascists, or is it everybody? Well it sounds like you work hard, and do a lot for our community. That is a great idea to me, a community of fascists. It's something I admire. We don't have that here much, except for a few others at the SSPX Chapel. I do a lot of work with the Church helping them teach, that is the best community I am a part of. Most of my friends have moved to the cities for University. But I admire that you keep a crew going. When times get tough, that is what will help us, these comrades and our relationship with them.<br /><br />Well, you are very hard working too! It sounds like you are so busy, I hope you don't get too tired out.<br /><br />And thank you for those things you say, I'm happy to hear that. It means a lot to have the support from someone who has held these views and been shaped by them for so long. I don't think I have any choice but to stick to them! Where else would I go? There's not a lot of hope for this part of the country, I sometimes think. Mainly the best thing to do is find those who are fascists like us and help them discover what that means, so they will not be pulled into the mud, so to speak.</p>
