<p>Save your Slavjew tears for another time. I'm putting my intended response here for you. You are a goddamn hypocrite. If I cared about "likes" I would believe in Democracy. I am correct in this instance no matter, and the only reason you may perhaps be benefiting Democratically is because your butthurt and cowardice prevented me from rebuttal.</p>
<p>Here is a picture, but of my childhood.</p>
<p>Also no, paranoia is perfectly Fascist especially since I have reasons. Both of us are technically threats to the liberal order. We think in radical ways and oppose their grip on power intellectually, socially, politically, and economically.</p>
<p>I don't care if you believe in ZOG, the fact is ZOG is bullshit and governments label people like us terrorist whether they are neo-nazi or JDL. I believe this suspicion is reasonable and substantiated. Putting pictures on the Internet makes available everywhere. If I were Vicky I would have told you to fuck off, regardless of whether I looked like Natalie Portman or not, I can admit it is none of our business.</p>

<p>Also, sorry about not understanding your obvious and clever and amazing hilarious meme that “everyone knows” that was completely not Autistic at all under any circumstances, because Internet memes are never Autistic, and being a pervert with strangers is completely acceptable if it has been approved by people all over the Internet. My sincere apologies. Perhaps refrain from social retardation in the future.</p>
<p>Listen, kike. The Nuremberg Law does not give a fuck what you look like, at all. I tried to use that argument before.</p>

<p>1 to 2 Jewish grandparents: Mischling</p>
<p>3 to 4 Jewish grandparents: Jew</p>
<p>(additionally) Slav parents: Slav. NICHTdeutschblütiger.</p>

<p>Here are your Slavic brothers:</p>

<p>You are in the same fucking racial position as me so don't be a hypocrite. Rather, you are actually worse by NS standards. I am a German Mischling. You are a Slavic Mischling. There is actually nothing redeemable about your racial position no matter what you look like. "The Slavs are a mass of born slaves, who feel the need of a master. The Russian space is our India! Like the English, we shall rule this empire with a handful of men. It would be a mistake to claim to educate the natives. The Slav people are not destined to live a cleanly life. It's better not to teach them to read. Even to give them a locomotive to drive would be a mistake. We'll supply the Ukrainians with scarves, glass beads, and everything colonials like." -Hitler, 1941</p>
<p>And Christian conversion wouldn't change this either:</p>
<p>"The Ethic of the German Religion condemns all belief in inherited sin, as well as the Jewish-Christian teaching of a fallen world. Such a teaching is not only non-Germanic and non-German, it is immoral and nonreligious. Whoever preaches this menaces the morality of the people."</p>
<p>-Thesis XV of the Twenty-Five Theses of the German Religion</p>
<p>I am not making anyone seem a hypocrite. I don't have to abandon Hitler completely just because I disagree with some things. At least I acknowledge that my National Socialism is apart of a different Conservative Revolution today, that Robert Michels and others spoke of.</p>
<p>In general, I find it hardly hypocritical for me to honor my heritage. For three generation before 1950, my family fought in all the wars for the Empire. They owned not companies or banks. They owned the respect of their families and were honored by their nation. After the war my grandfather worked for a company to make industrial chemicals, he is the only one to become "rich" in my family's long history of poverty, and he did it by blood, sweat, and ingenuity. Instead of feeling betrayed by National Socialists within this personal dialogue, I instead embrace it as an ideology of grand possibility.</p>
<p>Rather than be a hypocrite to myself or my nation, I do the opposite. In fact, I try to consistently paint National Socialism in a good light for liberals, but you Kikes seem to not be interested in any NS appeal. I realize this isn't actually activism, but in my general life I try to advance this political idea.</p>
<p>It is true, I would rather not focus on bad things the NSDAP did, so sue me ZOG. No one is free of sin and evil on this planet, but we try to find the good in what we can.</p>
<p>If that means I am making NS look "hypocritical" then fuck you. What did your family ever do for Germany? Did they improve plastic or some insecticide? Did they die in defense of this Holy Land?</p>
<p>As the Jews of the 19th century proclaimed, I can just as easily proclaim "Berlin is our Jerusalem! Germany is the Holy Land!"</p>
<p>And I don't understand the issue with this. It is precisely that the only true National Socialists here, who would have been perfect, are Vicky, TotalitarianSocialist, Volksgrenadier, and those similar ("We have no need for Christian virtue. Our leader is our savior. The pope and rabbi shall be gone. We shall be pagans once again." -Hitler Jugend song). They at least are consistent with true National Socialism, although I believe in a National Socialism that is adapted to be moral in the "Conservative Revolution" as the early Fascists called it. Again, at least I am not in denial in my patriotism...</p>
<p>"Nothing will prevent me from eradicating totally, root and branch, all Christianity in Germany."</p>
<p>-Hitler, 1933</p>
<p>"National Socialist and Christian concepts are incompatible."</p>
<p>-Martin Bormann</p>
<p>"One is either a Christian or a German. You can't be both."</p>
<p>-Hermann Rauschning</p>
<p>"The question of the divinity of Christ is ridiculous and inessential. A new answer has arisen as to what Christ and Christianity are: Adolph Hitler."</p>
<p>-Hans Kerrl, Minister of Religion in the Third Reich.</p>
<p>"The teaching of mercy and love of one's neighbor is foreign to the German race and the Sermon on the Mount is according to Nordic sentiment an ethic for cowards and idiots."</p>
<p>-Hans Hauptmann</p>
<p>"The Jews are not our enemies because of their race, but because one of their subtlest rabbis, that man called Saint Paul, distilled the poison of the Christ myth out of the life of the story of Jesus of Nazareth. The Jews are enemies of the Nordic race because they produced Christianity, which has been the poison that has destroyed the vitality of the Aryan people."</p>
<p>-Erich Ludendorff</p>
<p>"The Führer is deeply religious, though completely anti-Christian. He views Christianity as a symptom of decay. Rightly so. It is a branch of the Jewish race."</p>
<p>-Josef Göbbels</p>
<p>"You see, it's been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why didn't we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice for the Fatherland as the highest good? The Mohammedan religion too would have been much more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?"</p>
<p>-Adolf Hitler</p>
<p>It was not just simple things, like the requirement to renounce any faith in Christianity to join the Schutzstaffel, as an SS. It was larger than this.</p>
<p>When Synagogues were not targets for vandalism, Churches or Nativity scenes would be acceptable.</p>

<p>From Das Schwerze Korps, depicting the Christian/Catholic viper:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.remnantnewspaper.com/images/nazicartoon2.jpg" alt="nazicartoon2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Crucifixes were banned in Munsterland and Oldenburg schools in 1936. Some Christians tried to return the crucifixes in Munsterland but were arrested. By 1938, 3300 Catholic schools were closed.</p>
<p>Rosenberg, in addition to Himmler and Bormann, was particularly anti-Christian. Were his views officially held by the NSDAP? Well, it was illegal for pastors and clerics and clergy to refute Rosenberg's or Bormann's accusations against "Christianity as degenerate." Those who broke this law were imprisoned. By 1937, more than a hundred Protestant pastors and several thousand Catholic priests were in prison. Several thousand more Catholic political activists and members of Christian political parties who opposed anti-Papist propaganda and caricatures (such as the one in Das Schwarze Korps) were later sent to camps.</p>
<p>Cardinal Michael Faulhaber's 1937 book<em> Mit Brennender Sorge</em> was banned and burned for defending Christianity.</p>
<p>Rosenberg drew an approved plan that would be enacted after the war in the de-Christianization of Germany to focus on the Christian problem after the Jewish one, enacted by Himmler, Bormann, and all high command. The plan called for these steps:</p>
<p>-Create National Reich Church putting all churches under command</p>
<p>-All crucifixes and images removed and replaced by swastikas</p>
<p>-Printing of Bibles to stop</p>
<p>-All alters have a copy of Mein Kampf instead</p>
<p>Does this mean I think Christians should oppose National Socialism? Absolutely not! If I can get past certain realities to believe National Socialism is a workable solution today, then Christians can too. It does not often seem though that Christians are always aware that the only true National Socialists in the Third Reich were Pagan (the Pagans here who are National Socialist are technically true National Socialists, and the only ones eligible to join the Schutzstaffel). Which is not realistic to the Conservative Revolution. The reason for the Christian problem was conservative traditionalists who believed God was above any man on Earth that was not the Messiah, and were resistant to these concepts (that would not exist in a more perfect National Socialism).</p>
<p>Morality should not have been opposed to this degree, because Cardinal Michael Faulhaber (who also regularly sent packages and letters to priests in Dachau) was correct. Morality is what civilized us from Pagans that beheaded each other in human sacrifice, or were brutal and primitive and without justification for our existence in anything except endless and spiritually bankrupt Hedonism.</p>
