<p>Good to see someone taking advantage of their teen years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah I got out of school early too, but it was because I was a stubborn idiot that decided graduating at 19-20 would of been too far away so i got my GED when i was 17.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So now im essentially trying to start everything now that i figured wouldve been half way finished with by now, but better late then never i suppose.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>FML i shouldve started this shit when I was 18.</p>
