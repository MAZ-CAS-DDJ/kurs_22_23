<p>Interesting question, and it really depends on the situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In general, i see no reason to even put your nose in the business of other nations without a solid reason to begin with. America likes to play referee for the entire world, especially with third world nations, and it's resulting in a large amount of them turning around and hating us. Sure, a few times we were recognized as saviors, but now it's getting to the point where people just say "Oh, it's the f*cking Americans in our back yard again". And it's causing problems, obviously. And i think as time goes on, these problems will become bigger and the effects of our actions will intensify. We're going to feel the sting from swatting the bees' nest before too long, and it really could have been avoided (and probably still could be avoided, but i'd be surprised if our leaders make any sort of decision that will even indirectly help with that).</p>

<p>But of course, one aspect of Fascist ideology is the displacement of inferior nations to acquire living space. My views on this are basically the same as how Hitler put it: "We will only be justified in acquiring foreign land when every German is living within our borders and we are unable to guarantee him his daily bread" (not an exact quote, just the best i can do from memory).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many third world countries, i feel, are actually more nationalistic and culturally sound than most first world nations, and would actually be more ripe grounds for the foundation of a nationalistic type movement than would most first world countries anyways. It probably wouldn't be a bad idea, if and when an ideal state was founded, to ally with many third world countries who hold values and views similar to that of the (hypothetical) new state.</p>

<p>I hope i covered everything. If i left anything out, feel free to ask more specific questions on the topic.</p>
