	I personally love the region of Tennessee.  The smokey's astonish me and i like to take vacations over there as there is so much to do and see. Honestly the south was a mess when they laid a ground for niggers to be the primary labour force for its agriculture. I would like to see a very small presence of foreign races in the new america.
