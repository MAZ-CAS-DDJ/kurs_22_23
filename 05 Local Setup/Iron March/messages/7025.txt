<p>In the current circumstances, I don't understand why anyone who is a real man wouldn't like fascism, unless he's some criminal or totally ignorant about politics and history. I think most guys who stay away from fascism and are not faggots are simply cowards.</p>

<p>I think we live in best times to be fascists, I don't even care about defeat in 1945. 1918-1945 fascists gave us an idea and a powerfull myth, the most interesting story in history of mankind actually (even leftists can't deny their fascination with Hitler and NS) - I even remember my drunkard uncle who doesn't give a shit about anything reading a book about Hitler once. Now our generation has a chance to build everything from scratch. I couldn't imagine being anything else than a fascist. You stand out of the crowd, you're part of the most hated group in the entire world - European neo-nazi/fascists - yet there's so much fascination and admiration from everyone. Even the toughest organized crime groups are portrayed in favourable light compared to us in mass media and mainstream pop culture. The whole point of fascism today is to go out and have fun and laugh at degenerates around you. You abuse the good things this system has (if not for anything else because of technological progress) and have a vision of a better one in your head.</p>

<p>There's not much to add to fascism ideologically or philosophically speaking really, if you're redpilled fascist who's not afraid to look at things from fascist perspective, you learn everything you need to know about our society through experience. Just basic common sense and intelligence will do it. I mean, those right wingers who want to debate marxists take this insane modern society way too seriously and that's their ultimate fault. Do we really need to actually prove to anyone that homosexuality is a disease and that gender is not a social construct? It's like trying to debate with a spoilt kid who wants things to be the way he wants simply because he wants them to be so - that's what our infantile liberal society is all about. After observing the modern world from fascist perspective for 10 years I've realized this and I won't waste one more second to try to convert anyone who's insane enough to believe in this marxoid crap.</p>

<p>The best part of being involved in NS hooligan scene is you get to know so many people who you share some common worldview and values. I don't know how those regular people who for their entire life only hang out with 5-10 random people who happen to be their classmates or are from the same neighbourhood don't just die of boredom. I know many people of all sorts of background and I don't think I know more than 3 or 4 non-fascist/non-hooligan people who are interesting and fun to hang out with. Most fascist people on the other hand always have cool stories to tell. It's fun to just go out to one of our pubs and listen to stories and rumours about the latest crazy shit that some our guys did.</p>

<p>I never understood defeatism of some people, just because revolution is not going to happen in the next few years. I guess this is the mark of asocial types who wander into our movement just because of some personal frustrations or whatever.</p>
