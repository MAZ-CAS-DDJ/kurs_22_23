<p>Hey mate. Yeah to be honest the venue you've got in mind sounds okay, don't really think we have too much to worry about this time around. It depends. There's a few other Melbourne residents on here, so we could canvas them, or just catch up for a beer and a chat and figure the rest out later. I'm pretty busy at the moment with work and uni but we'll be able to figure something out I'm sure.</p>
