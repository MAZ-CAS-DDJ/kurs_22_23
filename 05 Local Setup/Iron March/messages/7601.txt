<p>There's your problem. Short case study: pali-Buddhism forbid women from the teaching, i.e. Buddha personally did not allow women to study in his way. Nowadays hippie-buddhist-feminist-cunts are all over the place. Should pretty much cover exactly the issue at its core.</p>

<p>That would be an issue, yeah. There is a chapter dedicated to Occultism specifically, but it can often end up as semantics to some extent at least. If I recall right Evola personally didn't favor that word.</p>

<p>The practices like the Mirror are, again, supplementary, ergo you can use them in both paths, chapter specified the mirror as a "direct" method, so a short cut, which is usually frowned on in a right hand path but can still be used as a tool for effect, so in that sense it can be used in the left hand path all the same, just so you don't mistake the supplementary practices for the core of either of the two Paths. They're different but do lead to the same state which is more immediately layed out in the Right Hand Path than in the left where its a result of an "inversion".</p>
<p>Again, this all has to do with transcendence and a new form of existence after material death, but the methods have their analogies in on other levels than personal, so when projected in politics Fascism stands as a Left-Hand Path, though that doesn't mean the same thing as on a personal level, naturally. You can use Fascist Style by Mohler as a reference as to how left hand / right hand paths appear on the level we operate, where what he calls the Fascist Style can correlate to the Right Hand Path while what he calls the Nazi Passion correlates to the Left Hand Path, this is something I've worked on a smaller scale with before I learned of the two paths two transcendence but immediately saw how they are represented in this same division. Savitri Devi utilized the distinction of People in Time, People Above Time and People Against Time, well those Above can correlate to the Right Hand and those Against to the Left Hand. You can use these reference points to better see what the two paths mean when applied to level that is our struggle, rather than a personal level of transcendence that is presented in the book you're currently reading.</p>
