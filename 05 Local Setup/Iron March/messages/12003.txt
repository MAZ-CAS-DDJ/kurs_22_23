<p>Yeah, kind of like how the Killzone games (which I have never played) did with the Helgast. I just think that it is hilarious that the people who do play that game hate the ISA and wish that they could play as the Helgast. Or at least that what a lot of internet comments say. Also, I am interested, how do you think you would go about promoting Fascism in a fantasy setting. I mean I could see were it could be done easily in a scfi setting. But I am just not for sure how it could be done in a fantasy setting. Unless it was some story about a knight or warrior who is totally loyal to his lord. Probably (but not necessarily) along the lines of Bushido or something. Â </p>
