	Sorry for the late reply but the right tent depends on the circumstances. Are you hiking around, or setting up camp and staying in one place? Will you have to carry the weight for long? Do you need to remain stealthy? In regards to the weather, most 2 skin backpacking or mountain tents should be able to easily stay dry and withstand strong winds, and they're usually quite light and quick to pitch. If it does leak (unlikely but it could) then you can get waterproofing sprays.
