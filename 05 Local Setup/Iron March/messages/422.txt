<p>I don't mind to answer your question. I'm from the Netherlands and involved within the autonomous movement there. I combine National-Revolutionary and National-Syndicalist thought with a healthy and moral etno-nationalism, because I think a homogenous social-cultural indentity is the most natural way to realize a solidary and harmonic society.   </p>
