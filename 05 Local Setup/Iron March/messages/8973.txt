<p>I wasn't expecting to make friends being the new guy. I'm glad you all understood the necessity for security. Here on IM I was shot down for daring to suggest such a necessity on the basis of:</p>
<p>We don't need it, we're not ISIS</p>
<p>I ripped off all my ideas from some corny website anyway (that website being my blog btw lol)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As to pursuing matters further, I commend your initiative. I might give the EFF an email actually. I trust the organisation. Rememver what I said, don't succumb to suspicion or superstition too much. There are groups out there who want the internet free and secure. And I've not seen many EFF Jew members so...</p>
<p>My current computer security course's tutor is the former EFF head incidentally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm glad TextSecure is of use. i don't use smartphones, if not for the simple fact that I always bloody break them haha.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My email is drakonc@protonmail.com. Hushmail is not secure these days, but I reckon Safemail is ok. If you can get your head around PGP, running that with Yahoo email should suffice. For one-off sensitive matters, Guerillamail is a temporary email service I've used in the past.</p>

<p>Do keep in touch. I'm on call to assist in any way I can. About time the system had something to seriously worry about.</p>
