<p>Yeah I'm not trying to be pretentious, you just got me thinking.  Linkola has a book published in english "Can Live Prevail" that isnt necessarily worth reading, the key parts have certainly already been discussed here and there online which can be tracked down.  He's just saying cull the population, destroy all modern technology created in the past century or so.  He also likes birding.<br /><br />I understand about 'not being a fascist', it certainly requires a lot of reading if you dont want to be another person who simply fetishizes fascist aesthetics and martial culture.  You're going to look back and realize that its plagued by people who program themselves to absolutely shut down when they encounter "bigotry."  Its really quite bizarre.<br /><br />On green anarchy, yes I think a central state is required to save the environment.  I think we need to go forward (a humans focus on technology and colonizing other planets) while the majority live a decentralized rural existence based around appropriate technology and holistic management. <br /><br />At one point a long time ago I remember reading that 'weeds are the shadow of civilization' and it took me years to finally realize that humans themselves are a weed species, left unchecked.  Capitalism is extremely resilient.  We could magically delete the United States today and the whole system would survive.  Whether its seedstock or the local college library, civilization could be reset globally and the concentrated resources available would allow the system to restart rapidly.   'Anarchy' would be a catastrophe as we head toward 11 billion people.  The 'splash damage' from the system collapsing at this point would decimate the environment.  The last wildernesses and nature reserves would be overrun and wiped away.  In many cases they are already surrounded by development and require police or military protection.  Even tools as simple as goats and fire can do astounding amounts of damage to the ecology.  Of course the exact dynamics of all this are infinitely debatable.<br /><br />Walther Darre at one point in the 1930's, according to that book I mentioned, advocated 'leaving the cities to ruin' and returning to an existence so decentralized it would be pre-political.  Once you really dig in you'll realize that the terms 'left' and 'right' are useless, as are most other ways of framing political reality.  Its a manifold space.  Fascism itself is broad enough to be very difficult to understand.  Reactionary Modernism is pretty close.<br /><br />I started as a green anarchist, I read Ted K's manifesto when I was young.<br /><br />On race, even wikipedia admits Homo sapiens have a genetic tree with more than one trunk.  Just take a look at the image and caption on the right side <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_human_admixture_with_modern_humans" rel="external nofollow">over here</a>.  If human populations are separated for many tens of thousands of years they'll be remarkably diverse.  And we can admire that.  <br /><br />The issue I finally had with anarchism, is that the epitome of it is writing a blank check for control to the most oppressed minority group by default.  My brain simply cannot compute the logic behind that.<br /><br />My ideal might be summed up as the concept of<em> landrace</em>.  I'd like to see a world where people are again able to become indigenous to a particular landscape, embedded in it.  I have reservations about permaculture, I'm ultimately trying to do something different.<br /><br />I am mostly vegetarian and would like to aim for vegan but think it also depends on context.  I think predators are an integral part of a healthy landscape and that there is a difference between killing and cruelty.  I'm good about not buying animal products, they're usually more expensive anyway per calories and/or per nutrient value.<br /><br />Naming the Jew is kinda a litmus test on the far right.  If someone is writing online, blogging or whatever, The Jewish Question eventually comes up.  'What is the role, if any, of Jews in the course of modern history?' Here on IM they'll want you to Name the Jew.  Here is <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2012/02/mark-weber-on-the-jewish-question-today/" rel="external nofollow">a podcast </a>on The Jewish Question that might be an ok introduction, not asking you to believe any of it or assume its accurate.  It will just give you an overview of the landscape of the topic.  If youre interested in listening to discussions with a very intelligent national socialist discussing classic NS perspectives on the jewish question, listen to the <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/2196-alexander-jacob/" rel="">two interviews listed here</a> by Alexander Jacob.  I think there's another similar interview on youtube.<br /><br />On jews and ecofascism, arguably only  that 'the desert is monotheist.'  Jewish materialism, the globalization and homogenization of the planet.  </p>
<p>I'm not sure about a perfect fascist state.  I'll think more about that.<br /><br />I dont see fascism as suppression, I see it as the opposite.  Its vitalistic and holistic.<br /><br />Anyway, I need to work on a few things but I will return to this in time.<br /><br />Hope this helps.</p>
