<p>No, I just worshipped at that alter for five years, I don't understand a thing about it. I could point you towards canal projects, such as the Erie Canal, Suez Canal, or Panama Canal, or towards Railroad projects such as the transcontinental or Trans-Canadian Project, or towards the US Highway system, Autobahn, the electircal grid, internet, or perhaps show the relationship between the rise of the British, American, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Asian tigers economies and protectivist policies, but ultimately every single example that could possibly be raised in economic history would be rejected out of hand, because <em>you</em> don't understand jack shit about economies. When your position is "Government always bad, free market always right", you clearly don't know the first thing about the economy.</p>

<p>1) You know jack shit about the military, so don't compare a business manager w/ an officer. I've seen both, they're not even close.</p>
<p>2) I don't believe for a second you own your own business. I'm accusing you of being a liar and a braggart, on top of being a moron.</p>
