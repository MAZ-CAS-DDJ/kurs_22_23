	Hey man, thanks a lot!
</p>

<p>
	Regarding your question.
</p>

<p>
	In the latest version you should see this <img alt="ivfhc7J.png" class="ipsImage" src="https://i.imgur.com/ivfhc7J.png" /></p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Maybe you need to install the latest version and uninstall the old one.
</p>

<p>
	Are you on the TRS forums? There is a thread with instructions
</p>

</p>

<p>
	In case you can't access it, you can tell me your browser and I can extract the information for you.
</p>

<p>
	Or go here <a href="https://bit.no.com:43110/1As8nyiVibNzfjLiS1eCinYia2dK2ZgHiz/" rel="external nofollow">https://bit.no.com:43110/1As8nyiVibNzfjLiS1eCinYia2dK2ZgHiz/</a>
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The integration works this way:
</p>

<p>
	Every name the CD finds, which is not already linking to something, will be made into a link to the respective entry on JW.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Once you have set everything up, you can go here <a href="https://judas.watch/api/v1.1/get_all_person_names" rel="external nofollow">https://judas.watch/api/v1.1/get_all_person_names</a>
</p>

<p>
	and some of the names should be links. If that's the case your CD plugin works as expected.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Cheers
</p>
