<p>Still in the Struggle, got fired from my job looking for a new one, Moving into a new apartment, pretending to be a high roller at the Casino, wondering if i should supplement my income with illicit activities, taking part in my first execution (of a Deer), Wondering why the only women i seem to attract are either Married or in High school.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Having fun and being frustrated with money woes in equal measure i suppose.</p>
