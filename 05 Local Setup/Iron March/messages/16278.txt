	I moved over to this community earlier this year. A friend of mine had mentioned IM a lot, but I didn't really get involved until I'd met some people from here. It coincided with my friends and I becoming more action focused. I honestly wasn't well read enough on it to call myself a fascist until recently. What sparked your interest in the fascist' worldview?<br /><br />
