<p>Canadian soldiers are tough as fuck.  There's no denying that.  I respect the Canadian Army more than the US Army.  My  reservist friend got hypothermia in some week-long training exercise and now there's a possibility he might have to get part of the toe removed, because he pushed through the entire exercise and didn't pussy out over his cold feet.  A US soldier would whine and timeout barring special forces people.  Marines are no doubt our hardest and most aggressive main outfit, but it largely depends on the individual.  We have a few quitters.  From what I've seen being merely a pre-butterbar cadet in NROTC, the ones who fight to the end and don't give up when the training gets tough are almost always hwhite aryan.  That's what matters the most.</p>

<p>We have the same problem in America, although America is much bigger and totally controlled by kikes and kike interests for the time being, so nobody really notices it, and the leftist media doesn't report on it.  Homeless soldiers living out on the street in the cold while a bunch of savages with no real interest in being Canadian anyways get nice, cozy houses.  That cuts deep, and I'm not even Canadian.</p>

<p>You think Canada's gonna shift more to the right after a few years of Current Year Man?</p>
