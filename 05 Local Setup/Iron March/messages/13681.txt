	I agree reaction is kind of irrelevant since they haven't done anything of substance. I haven't heard much of the Silver Legion so the same goes for them in my eyes. Either way if we have four people in the near future that's enough to get something started on our own, and if reaction of silver legion seem like good choices in time than we can decide from there.
