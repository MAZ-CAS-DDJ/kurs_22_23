	Yeah, sounds like the "charges" were trumped up to being with. What always gets me though is that the left always claims to be about tolerance, equality, freedom, and other false masks (Lets face it these words and concepts are lies to begin with) yet when it comes to us they persecute us to no end and they (ironically) uses some of the very same tactics that they claim and hate us for using. "Oh, but that is okay/different since our JewMarxist masters told us it is".  The left have never and will never as far as I am concerned have the right to any so called "moral high ground"
