	Yeah, rope jumping is neat but it was so hot outside at one point I was starting to feel dizzy because I have this habit to go to gym at 13-14 o' clock when the heat is unbearable and I usually do it after the workout so few times I had to postpone it a bit early cuz I felt i'll just drop there :D . I was also running mornings but it is just too boring. We have few parks around my neighborhood but still it's not really my thing. I also have a bike but have no place for it since my family's apartament is small and i can't keep it near me so for now it's dumped at my grandma's cellar.
