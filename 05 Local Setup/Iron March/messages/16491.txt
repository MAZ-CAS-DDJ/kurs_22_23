	Not like that, my college is an International one based on American curriculum. I just wanted to ask you questions about the degeneracy in your place. Is the degeneracy-promotion by leftists more common in the urban or rural parts of the country? You won't believe the contrast here. In rural areas we are very anti-degeneracy but suddenly when I lived the city it became 100x more degenerate. My biggest fear is that Hindus will fall for this and using my country to export degeneracy all around the world.
