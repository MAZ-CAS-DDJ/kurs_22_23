<p>I completely agree. And hey, if you're already involved with them to such an extent, I say more power to you. Good for you. If it ever gets to the point of paramilitarism and actual combat, I might volunteer my set of skills, that sounds amazing. But until then, I really don't think that a South American with a thick gringo accent should be contributing. I'm rooting for you guys, though.</p>
