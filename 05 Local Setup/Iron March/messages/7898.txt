<p>I know you're young and passionate right now and you're right to be angry about everything around you but I have to warn you that if you say anything remotely race realist, fascist etc you will be expelled from your school.  I know. .</p>
<p>Trying to form some public group will ruin your life.  You will be black listed from society and barred from any employment as soon as any news media gets wind of it.  Have you heard of Matthew Heimbach?  He will never be able to make a decent living because of what he did.</p>
<p>If you have to rely on your own labor to feed you I'd seriously consider just keeping your head down and getting through school right now.  I know its disgusting but they've got us. . .</p>
