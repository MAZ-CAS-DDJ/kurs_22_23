<p>Atomwaffen Division is an organisation me and about 15+ other folks are apart of. We have a Southern Chapter (Dixie Chapter) but we are mainly based in Florida (Most of our members live down here and we meet up to go hunting,paintballing and do activism) but we have a Northern Chapter based in Chicago with three guys. A lot of us are on Iron March and we are going to try and get everyone on IM.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are an ingroup focused on making capital and being a true Fascist fraternity. Made up of all ages and European backgrounds, but with common goals. We have folks in Texas,Maine and some guys in the West aswell. </p>
