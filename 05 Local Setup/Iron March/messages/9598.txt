<p>I think Casapound has good graphics, but yours are far lovelier and could serve them well... You say you are after your citizenship by blood? I didn't even know that was possible!</p>
<p>Exactly. And our children are not just a memory of us, they are a living echo of everyone who came before. I have never felt stronger than when I remember: the breath and memory of thousands flows through us, each beat of our hearts is an echo of their existence. And that I have children, that I might give something to the river of blood that flows to the sea, is the greatest honor.</p>
<p>I think about my own children a lot, how it will be to hold someone who was created out of my own flesh and that of the man I love.</p>
