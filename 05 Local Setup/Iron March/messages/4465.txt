<p>I'll check them out. I noticed that you mentioned Revilo P. Oliver and Ben Klassen in the thread. The problem with Ben Klassen is he quotes out of context a lot and does not understand the historical or racial context of the bible and Revilo goes the same way in a lot of ways, not understanding Natural revelation concepts. They also equate it with weakness and the dark ages, something which they are historically ignorant or biased of (falling into the trap of the secular rationalists) and even primitive communism, something which I began refuting in my Nietzschean thread. I would concede at the most that Bolshevism is an illegitimate child of Christianity, but most things cherry pick from Christianity, fascism can just as easily be claimed as a child of Christianity.</p>
<p>I'm personally a presbyterian (more liek presbytaryan, amirite?) - protestant and most calvinists are considered racists anyway, and they are. The church I go to in Sheffield is all white and the sermons are the most politically incorrect you can hear. Proper teaching and understanding is key to understanding. The creationists were a christian set that came about as a fearful reaction to the evolutionists - these did more to peak skepticism of christianity than anybody.</p>
<p>RPO and BK had their hearts in the right place and their values actually had more in common with Christianity than they actually realized, but their egos were blown way out of proportion to their heads, especially in the case of Ben Klassen. They certain weren't in the league of the likes of Rushdoony, Cornelius Van Til, Martin Luther and John Calvin. Kikes have done a good job on their attack on Christianity and the West.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is many people loathe politics and are becoming disilusioned with them; they associate politics with law and it's not such a far stretch to make; bureaucracy. They desire direction and authority but enough to allow them some self-responsibility. Once the forum's back up I intend on posting a lot more information on Christianity. Secular politics are no match for the leftists who pursue their egotism and humanism with religious vigour.</p>
<p>I have 2 books to recommend you which I think you'll find of interest:</p>

<p>Especially the top one. I'll dedicate a topic to destroying this idea of weakness in Christianity.</p>
