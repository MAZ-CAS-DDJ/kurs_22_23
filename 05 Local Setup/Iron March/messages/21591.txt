	Don't hope to become stronger. Become stronger and start now. Affirmation of life is what you need. Life is struggle, remember? From the moment you wake up it is. Be a real sol sorcerer. The first step to finding strength is to actually do it. You put yourself in a defeatist attitude. Do not excommunicate yourself because you are ashamed or afraid. We want to help you and we will, but ultimately you need to go and start yourself. You keep saying "i'm a burden" "if" "maybe" "can't" e.t.c. You put yourself into the wrong mindset, a pathetic mindset as well. Get in touch with our guys in your area, don't isolate yourself. Isolation will do you even more harm. The largest problem at this very time isn't what you've done, rather, it's the mindset you have adopted in regards to it now.
