<p>We have the supremacists, the nationalists, the hooligans and the philosophical here and it's not done under a forced pretense like it is on other forums. More time needs to be invested offline and living a life more.</p>

<p>honestly all the good old members I have been talking to on the issue say pretty much the same thing. I thought I should leave plenty of times in the past year but I mainly stick to it out of habit; I do freely speak on issues of politics with friends but it isn't the same, here the context is wholly free of constraint, and I don't have to beat around the bush or explain stupid things. The main thing keeping me right now is 1 currently I have the time 2 the latest thread, which had a goal. still gauging its success.  for me all the Aryanist stuff has had a much more direct implication of what I need to do now, in Ukraine, so I may well be gone entirely for a long time soon enough. And anyway, I have been long enough here to consider some something like friends, and I may as well say what I can while there is nothing much better to do and it is definitely not difficult. When the doors do open for me, I will definitely not be online anymore.</p>

<p>Marriage; I have always said the same thing. You don't need to warn me about interracial stuff, some foreign girls are definitely attractive but they just don't appeal to me spiritually or personally. If I ever live in a foreign country maybe I'll find a local girl to live with for the duration, but it isn't something I would aim for. it is more of a 'club' culture in foreign countries too, retards that look for some sort of genuity everywhere but the west are fucking cunts, because in the cases where there is a more conservative attitude (say Asia) it is citizen and education marriages. The funniest thing is when these people come to Ukraine and pick up used 300k 30+ leaking pussies with half a dozen abortions, and think they come out of it victorious. Women aren't stupid, they pass themselves off as exactly what the lemming-brains want them to be. But anyway, the furthest I would racemix (for life I mean) would probably be Germany.</p>
