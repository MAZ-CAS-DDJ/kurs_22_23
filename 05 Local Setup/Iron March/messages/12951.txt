	You could say that it took a while, years of mostly just trying how everything works and went from primitive shit to somewhat more advanced tricks, only started looking up manuals and instructions on how to do certain things much later. And I can't draw for shit other than small little doodles so no, you don't necessarily have to have any hand drawing skills for this, none of my own stuff has hand-drawn elements to it.

	A lot of it is image manipulation, I take existing images and use them as the base for something else.
