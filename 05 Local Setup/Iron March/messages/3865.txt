<p>Good News Ben,</p>
<p>Gary has dropped the link to Richard's 'National Integralist Front' on the 'British Nationalist Parties' section of the new NBU website. Gary now lists your Integralist Party of Great Britain and the League of St George and others.</p>
<p>I've sent you some emails.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
