<p>Absolutely! I'll remember that. And thank you, I really mean it. I've been coping better than I expected. I went to see a silly movie today, it was nice to forget for a while. Staying busy helps too. The weird thing is when i forget he's passed. I was sitting on the couch, wondering what to do. I decided to go visit him and then I remembered. He's not really gone though, I love knowing that. We're so lucky to have this gift, to know that there is more than this life, and more at work for our salvation than we can ever see.</p>
<p>I've been to Montana, Oregon, Arizona, Hawaii, California, Washigton, New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland. I loved Hawaii, my fiance actually used to live there. The native culture there is really cool. Most tribal societies tend to be a series of bloody headhunts, but the Hawaiians had it good.</p>
<p>I live near Seattle, which is a horrid city in a beautiful place. We actually live in a rainforest, though not a tropical one. I grew up in a beautiful town that started out as a fishing village for the natives, and later became a small shipping port and a town for loggers and adventurers. I used to ride my bike down to the beach during storms to stand on the dock and watch the waves. There's mountains, beaches, forests, rivers, farmlands, and cities, none more than an hour away.</p>
