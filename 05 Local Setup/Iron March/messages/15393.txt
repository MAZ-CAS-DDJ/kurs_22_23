	Hey Xav, well after playing the game for a long while and getting dangeresly close to neckbeard territory I have just decided to delete and forget about the old republic. I just can't trust myself with it. Damn my OCD that just makes me jump into things like this and then jump out. Besides, I would rather just spend my time working out and reading. I find as I get older video games really just don't interest me anymore. Anyways, sorry for bothering you so much. Let me know if you get this.

	PS At least know I can watch some Varg videos!
