<p>Hello Simon,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It depends on what you are willing and able to do. I realize that promoting Fascism can be dangerous to ones health and financial well-being so at a bare minimum I ask everyone to do whatever they can do to promote the cause. If that is only online activism or trying to convert ones friends then that's still better than doing nothing at all. At this point it would be ideal if we could get together enough people in the same city or region so we could have monthly chapter meetings. Only it it's only a small handful of 4 to 5 people it would be a great start, and good publicity for the cause here in the states. So if you know enough people who are sympathetic that would be a great contribution. Also if you have any skills that you might think would be of use let me know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately this is the only Fascist group I belong to. There are others such as the National Socialist Movement and various white nationalist organizations that I share some values in common with but none of them represent the Fascism of Moseley or Mussolini that I most admire.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And one more thing, If some of the members here  give you shit about being a member of the NBU just ignore them. Any organization which doesn't fit perfectly their idea of what a Fascist group should be they will trash. Other than that this is a pretty good place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's good to have you aboard, I will keep in touch</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Josh.</p>
