<p>Nice one mate, I'm south west of WA, always wanted to see Queensland...the dispersion of our folk is quite a hefty problem when it comes to organising. Nah not many mate, always good having a few more...what do you make of Australia First Party? Leaves Alot to be desired I must say, especially since we have no faction here in WA.  </p>
