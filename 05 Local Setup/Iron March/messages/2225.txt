<p>Are you interested in a debate comparing Allah with Jehovah or not?</p>
<p>If you are not, I will not bother you further.</p>
<p>If you were offended by my calling Allah a Moon god, then do not worry... I will continue to do so.</p>
<p>The problem with your debate suggestion is that I could not debate something I do not believe in. So I did not disagree with you necessarily. And as there was not a real disagreement on my part (mainly apathy), I could not accept.</p>
<p>However (to make a debate worth my time), I am interested in a debate of Islam/Allah compared to Judeochristian tradition/Jehovah. Allah as derived from Arabic polytheism. If you are interested in my entire thesis, <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/1339-black-nationalist-der-lowe-allah-swt-moon-god/page__pid__34116#entry34116" rel="">check the thread again.</a></p>
<p>I have informed the Russian mod and he will reopen the thread if we can come to an agreement.</p>
<p>If you cannot, then I will not bother you on the subject.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
