<p>Thx for the link of the blog on your fb page.  As asked before, have you any experience with WordPress or the operational side of blogs <em>vis-a-vis</em> increasing their profile?  I have done some preliminary checking on WordPress and through search engines but not finding any idiot proof steps for the likes of me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How is the new fb page going that you made reference to on the 3rd.?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any initial feed-back from UK on the NBU?  It is probably too early but, one never knows.</p>
