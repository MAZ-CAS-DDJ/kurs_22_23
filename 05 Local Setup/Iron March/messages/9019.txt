<p>A dual major. Accounting and Management Information Systems (Basically the CS department of Business). I have to get 150 credit hours and a single major gives 120, so a dual major, which involves a few summer courses and internships or about five years, provides 150 credit hours. The reason I need 150 is to get my CPA which is basically my ticket into getting almost any job in the field. I can probably get a job with just the major but the CPA looks good on the resume and also gives me a license to perform audits, taxes, and investigations, which is what people hire very often for.<br /><br /><br />The business program is decent but it's not a business school, so... yeah.</p>
