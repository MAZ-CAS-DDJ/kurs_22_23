	You can do it at a library or something like that (ideally do it at a uni library or somewhere with printer cards that you can sign up without any id etc and top it up with cash only). If you do it at home, I've got no idea, but libraries are normally between 10 and 20 cents per page.

	For glue, we use bondcrete with parts water for every one part of the glue with a spray bottle. Make sure to get the air bubbles out, and do your postering at a time that will give it a minimum of 2 hours to dry, which will make paint or specialised cleaning the only real method of removing it.

	Good luck.
