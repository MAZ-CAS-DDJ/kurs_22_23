<p>It comes from the Italian word "Irredento", which means "Unredeemed". It's occurs when a piece of land is believed to rightfully belong to a particular nation, whether through history, ethnicity, culture etc, but belongs to a different nation or is independent. "Irredentists" believe that this land should once again become part of its "rightful" owner. In my case, I believe that Malta should slowly rejoin Italy (If Italy can get herself together).</p>
