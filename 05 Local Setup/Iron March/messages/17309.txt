	And your point is? The alt right is worth little to fascism. their petty squabble won't change a thing in our society as long as they have that tolerance of the system with the admiritaion of donald trump and such.

	I don't care about leftists or rightists. they both make up shitty political parties full of autistic rubbish. I want a FASCIST future, not neo con reactionary bullshit. aslo white identity politics don't work. that is why we must wage war against these political enemies and fill our nation full of integrity. I feel  you don't understand that being red pilled doesn't make you fascist or fanatical.
