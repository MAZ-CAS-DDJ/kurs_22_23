<p>Fascism to me is:</p>
<p>- <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Revolutionary</strong></span>; fighting not merely for a slightly different version of our society, but a new society.</p>
<p>- <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Social</strong></span>; meaning national fraternity displayed economically, people over economics.</p>
<p>- <span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>Rightist</strong></span>; meaning culturally and socially conservative. This doesn't mean "hating faggots and niggers," but simply purging or making "private" what you perceive as negative cultural and social elements within the nation. Elements that hurt the nation and the unity of the people. Personally I include racialism, social conservatism, and a dash of environmentalism in this. But this varies from person to person.</p>
<p>- <span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>Militant</strong></span>; meaning a dedication to one's ideals and the willingness to stand up for them. You can kill and still be a coward. It's standing up for your beliefs, whether it's a civil debate or a pitched battle, that makes you a patriot, a nationalist, a Fascist.</p>
<p>But all this means nothing if you aren't educated. Go to Wikipedia's "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism" rel="external nofollow">Fascism</a>" page and use the box on the right. There are dropdown lists of different types of fascism, different aspects of it, different fascist philosophers and leaders, different organizations, different theories, and most important of all, history. If you're like me you'll read one Wikipedia page on Fascism, and that'll lead to 4, 5, or maybe 6 other related or linked articles that were found on the page that you'd then want to go and read, and so on and so on, steadily expanding your understanding. Wikipedia offers you little more than the basics, but they're important. When you're done exploring or if you want further information on a particular fascist topic, come back to IM and somebody will help you find the first-hand texts and writings that will give you a deep, full understanding of what you're looking for.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
