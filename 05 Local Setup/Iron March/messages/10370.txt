<p>I'd want to help where i'd be most useful, being in the fight appeals to me the most but from what little english sources i've read it's seems that they require more experianced veterans/advisor types with military experiance to raw recruits. English is also my only language and i wouldn't want to be liability to unit cohesion.  But if that's something that can be worked around I would definately be willing to soldier for Azov.</p>

<p>In the next few months i'm planning on getting involved in my local fire company where their is EMT medical training as well as taking college courses for Web Design and Audio/Video production and editing. Once I have the technical knowhow i would be more that ethusiastic to aid your PR and Media.</p>
