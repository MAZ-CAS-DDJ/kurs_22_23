<p>Got to thinking about a too-prejudiced opinion on the Soviet Era and Russian Nationalism. I suddenly remembered Gen. Alexey Brusilov's call to arms of Russian Nationalists to join the Red Army in April 1920, that the Soviet Union was Russian, defending Mother Russia against the Poles and others. He saw what some like Denikin and others could not. I get it. Anyway, let me know what you think.</p>
