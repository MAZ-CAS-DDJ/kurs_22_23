	Yeah my first love was an ostensibly traditional girl, but, as I later found out, was doing some crazy shit behind my back with LSD and mushrooms. I was at a really overpriced private school at the time, so I didn't even think this well presenting girl (she dressed modestly), who went to church every week, was capable of this.

	I was also on the other side of it later when I got with another seemingly traditional girl, only for her to tell me weeks into it that she had a boyfriend AND that we can continue together.

	Needless to say, your post definitely would have helped me if I had seen it before either of those experiences, as I was completely blindsided on both occasions.
