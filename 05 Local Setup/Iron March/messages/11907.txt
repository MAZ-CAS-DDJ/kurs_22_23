<p>Yeah, you're bound to find something. I got my resume made on indeed.com, in case you're unfamiliar. It walks you through all of that shit and for most jobs you can just click "apply with resume" and it will send it to the company. I did that for around 20 different job postings on there and started within that week. lol. As for me, not much. I'm working at a cheese factory as a temp for now. Hopefully I'll get hired on. starting wage is over $16 an hour just to unpack and slice cheese...</p>
