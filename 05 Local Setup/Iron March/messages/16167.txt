	Yes, I have read that Berberism is against Islam, but for me it looks like that they don't like it because of the Arabs. That's still not a reason to reject Islam though; I have worked with Indonesians a few years ago and one of them told me they hate the Arabs but they are completely separating them from Islam. I don't really have a clear opinion regarding this question, since on one hand I see how the Arabs spread with Islam (they have completely eradicated the original Egyptians as far as I know), but on the other hand it looks like that the real Muslims don't care if you are Arab or not, similar to the Christians.

	With all of this, it is possible that there are some good parts in Berberism, like the countries which were separated by colonialism:

	What do you think? That could be great if they wouldn't be against Islam, a great Alliance of White/Arabic North African countries led by Algeria (with the guidance of the Sufi masters of course). It looks like that Algeria is the most powerful and the largest country in the region. Maybe you could take the lead now that Libya is in ruins.

	Maybe you don't have a Fascist elite yet, but the situation is not much better here with our Chauvinistic masses. I like Jobbik and Vona because he is against Chauvinism and he is a follower of the Holy Tradition. Strange situation... We have the political movements in Europe but most of us lack the Traditionalism, and you have a lot of Traditionalists but you lack the political movements. That's why it is good that you travel a lot because with this you will have the experience which is needed to start a movement.
