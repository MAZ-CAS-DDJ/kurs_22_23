<p>well I can't really say that I'm a Hindu myself but my father and his family are Hindu. I have read a lot about it and certainly am interested in it, but idk if that alone makes me Hindu.  My father is actually having our yearly prayer next month so he is certainly into it. </p>
<p>I'm not white.  My father is Indian and my mother is from the Dominican Republic ( Spanish and native mix mostly)   That creates a creature like this:</p>

<p>Also Nazi's and Fascists do tend to be into Hinduism.  The Fascist worldview is the same truth that the Hindu tradition is. There is a lot in common with them and you'll see that if you really get into everything.  We Fascists don't attack religion but we learn about them and their roots because we know that all real religions are manifestations of the same truths that we fight for.  </p>
<p>Religion is very important.  There is a lot to learn which means that you're in for a lot of reading. Browsing this forum is a good start but there are also many books that you should seek out and read.</p>
