<p>You don't sound like a complete moron- at least less so than the other <em>muh classical fascism</em> shits we get normally. Otherwise I wouldn't bother messaging. You actually need to read the <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/5131-registration-introduction-guidelines-up-to-date-as-of-121115/" rel="">intro materials</a>. Specifically the IM originals and the Next Leap.</p>

<p>Drop the "stop arguing with me" shit. That won't help you. This isn't a circlejerk forum where we tell everybody they have a valid opinion. Our purpose here on Ironmarch is to hone our worldview into a consensus. Since you are a newcomer you need to actually catch yourself up to where we are at before you start trying to inject your own views since these are all topics we went over three years ago.</p>

<p>Sorry if I was offensive. The thing that really irritated me was the first reply. "Gas the kikes...". That's what put me into a foul mood.</p>

<p>I will be the first one to admit to you, off the record, that I am not the biggest fan of the Jews - if you catch my drift. Nor am I a huge fan of multiculturalism (I despise it, in all honesty). But I am worried about public perception. It's already bad enough that we're going to have to call ourselves something else besides "Fascist" once we get to where we can actually rise to power, so maybe it's a lost cause at this point. I don't know.</p>
