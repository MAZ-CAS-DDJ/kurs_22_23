<p>"You might have come across this already in your research, but if you haven't - <a href="http://www.fundacionjoseantonio.es/doc/Antologia_en_ingles.pdf" title="External link" rel="external nofollow">http://www.fundacion...a_en_ingles.pdf</a> it's a collection of writings and speeches by Jose Antonio."</p>
<p>Yeah that was a good read.</p>
