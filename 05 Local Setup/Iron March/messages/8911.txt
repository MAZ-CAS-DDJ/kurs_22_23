<p>I broke several teachers doing that and got some really bad marks. I couldn't stop trying to piss them off. Essay about the great depression? Turn it into an essay about the hero of the people Adolf Hitler. Oh, oh, there was this one history teacher who was this 70 or so year old woman. She had me put into a different class because I "intimidated" her. Literally never made any threats or posturing or anything, I only spoke to her one on one once or twice, and I come off as more charming than I do intimidating. But, I did write something about six million not dying and that jews deserved it anyway. Essay terrorism.</p>

<p>It's hilarious watching people, even men who are taller and bigger than you are look at you in horror and fear as if you are about to pull out a bomb or a gun at any moment and start RAHOWA. I had one of my mother's friends do that after she saw my Hitler desktop wall paper. She's never spoken to my mother or visited since.</p>
