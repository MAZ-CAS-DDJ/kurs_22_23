	Very interesting. Regarding nice girls, in Serbia there is a stereotype that Hungarian women are hot :D<br /><br />
	Croatians think their language is Croatian and not Serbian. Just like Bosnians think their language is Bosnian, Montenegrians thing their language is Montenegrian etc. You don't discuss illness with mentally ill. It's pointless to argue with them.
