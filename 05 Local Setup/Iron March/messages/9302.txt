<p>I'm sorry to hear that, I'll make some prayers for you. I'll study education, to be a teacher! I will be traveling three hundred miles away, to live with my best friend and work and study. To a city called Portland, a liberal place. Maybe I will make some good activism, I know a few fascists in that city. Do you stop school for the summer?</p>
