<p>Alex,</p>
<p>I have a couple of questions that I have been wanting to ask for some time now. For starters, I am starting my own video project, but I find windows movie maker to be very disappointing. Can you tell me what software you use?</p>
<p>Also, I want to do some things for my office, but I want to stay in line with previous Iron March and Itpf propaganda. So I was wondering if you could perhaps send me the logo, and perhaps tell me what kinds of fonts you use and maybe even other nice details like that.</p>
<p>And now for the grand finale. You had quite some ambitious projects planned for this site, as I read on Itpf. How are they going? Is there anyway I can help? </p>
<p>Ritz.</p>
