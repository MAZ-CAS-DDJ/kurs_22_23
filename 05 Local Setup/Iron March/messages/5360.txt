<p>So I had a couple of questions. First, do you have skype? Second, how do you feel about futurism?</p>
<p>I liked your blog on Charles Ciroan (I think that was you). Thanks for the time!</p>

<p>I do not Skype, though I ought to. Why do you ask?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I did no blog on Ciroan, but I know the guy who did.</p>

<p>Well, we just have a lot of people on Skype. I'm focusing on getting more Americans on. Ahh, your avatar and the Synarchist ideology had me convinced you wrote it. You should definitely get on skype, much easier to chat on there.</p>
