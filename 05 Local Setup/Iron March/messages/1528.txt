<p>Thanks, part of the reason I took a break from the forum was huge number of racists here. You really can't debate seriously with them because inevitably end up blaming the blacks, Jews or Muslims. I'm well of the problems with minority groups, and am not entirely dismissive of the idea of actual differences between ethnic populations, I just believe you can't do anything until you know for sure and in any case I doubt there will ever be any real difference worth bothering about. The opinions on Jews and Asians also simply confuse me, both groups generally score higher in academic studies than whites, yet there is some kind of view that they are inferior. Personally I'd prefer it if a harder line was taken with the racists, they do have their own little place to discuss their ideas separate from the main forum, and if we ever want fascism taken seriously we will need to expunge such views.</p>
