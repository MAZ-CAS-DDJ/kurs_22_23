<p>Thanks for keeping ears out for my name, although their opinion is pretty irrelevant to me. This site is run by a cabal of immature racists and reactionaries who hide behind the moniker of fascism. Any thought that counters that groups established, often contradictory, beliefs is ostracized and mocked until no one takes them seriously. The site used to be a lot different but is pretty much useless now. They dislike me because of my rejection of race being a matter of importance for a centralized fascist state. The simple fact is that it is not and nowhere in early fascist writings is this even mentioned. They can twist things how they want but they reject the revolutionary wing of fascism if it doesn't still manage to fit into their narrow views. Whatever, I am not concerned about it. It is the reason I am fairly inactive now.</p>
