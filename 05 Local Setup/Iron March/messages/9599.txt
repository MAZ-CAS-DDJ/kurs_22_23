<p>Heh, it got cut a bit short by Alex asking me to be a mod, but I did move forward on my projects, started lifting again for a while, and upheld some extremely strict vows (still do). So overall, an improvement, but still ways to go.</p>

<p>Now working on a promotional video to recruit people for my project, a permaculture and natural building group. Of course, it'll be fascist by virtue of the fact that I'm in it, though it won't be explicitly so. But basically, I can't pretend not to be fascist anymore, so anything I do will tend towards that. The strategy here in quebec has to be different from the USA, since we can't topple the system until you guys do it, lest we be invaded or suffer a sponsored counter-revolution. We have to focus on "dropping out" and building strength and independence, and the first step to that is the ability to build houses for cheap, grow food without too much trouble, heat homes economically, etc. I've studied all these problems, now I need people to help.</p>
