<p>I wouldn't consider Wicca or the modern "feel good" religions real one. While I am a agnostic I simply can't believe that the religions that simply go by the rule of the land and modern BS are legit. It is almost as bad as the "chose your own" beliefs what is popular lately. If a religion doesn't change the person adhering it then it is a fake for me. On some level Wicca seems to be a product of the fantasy novels and entertainment industry in general while carrying Oprah morality. It sure is bad. The problem is that these New age hippies simply won't see their own errors. They want their ideas reflected in their own religion instead of changing their own ways.</p>

<p>No wonder why even today Christianity is being ridiculed, it's worse than beating a dead horse at this point. All those edgy "artist" and gay parade and media people stick it up to the religion that pretty much gave up resisting 50 years ago. It is a shame...</p>

<p>Yeah. Rome had a luck of ripping off the culture and accomplishments of Greece and Macedonia. While others had to work from scratch at that point. In some ways Rome's centralization was what it hurt it thanks to the corruption and the bat shit crazy emperors they had. I think when there was too much peace or victory they simply lost touch with reality and struggling with cultural changes with Christianity and the Germanic tribes was simply too much for them to adapt to.</p>

<p>Rome too had it's ancestry worship and one of my favorite philosophies come from there "stoicism". I can say it is fitting to their virtue based life. Currently what I miss in society is the lack of values. Imagine if all those welfare people would be ashamed of being leeches and they would stop making kids they can't afford. The economy would certainly be better. But no what concept of real pride we had had to be corrupted and turned into opposite. Now the weak say they are weak and they expect to be carried on a silver plate for it. Imagine that even a hundred years ago. It simply wouldn't exist this way.</p>

<p>Today: "oh no you killed us you evil person"</p>
<p>Yesterday: "stop bullshitting conqueror you didn't killed as many of us as you say"</p>
