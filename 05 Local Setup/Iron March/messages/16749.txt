	No and no sadly. Didnt save up enough bucks to go back, and I want to start LOTGH from the start, so I'm delaying that. Discord is a chat app/site, most IM folks are on there. There's a thread for it somewhere on the forum. Other then that, I'm trying to get en english teaching job, finishing some english teaching course now.Â
