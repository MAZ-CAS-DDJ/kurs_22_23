<p>It's going well. I've outlined it to three sections and about 36 chapters. and am currently gathering evidence and research before I begin writing each section out, but they are divided One: by the history, culture, tolerance, "diversity" and political changes that allowed the crisis to happen. How it will affect people, how they are going to accomplish their goals, how they've already accomplished their goals, touching up on the groups: Bilderburg, CERN, GLAAD, NAACP, FEMA, NSA, Anti-Defa, The Media, GOP, DNC, The Vatican, Israel, The Libertarians... Touching up on incidents and policies like the Obama Administration acts which, if you can comprehend what they're about, basically guarantee that under a martial law directive, your rights can be seized by the government, which was already mostly guaranteed by the Patriot Act under the Bush administration. The first section goes into detail the issues, a massive redpilling on what you need to know.<br /><br />Section two goes on our directives, policies, insurgency, and rebellion tactics, as well as our strict doctrine, zero-tolerance, and aesthetics. It will start fresh, what a person who has never heard of fascism or nationalism needs to know and needs to do to start out, and eventually take over an entire nation and eventually the world.<br /><br />Section Three will outline the management and administration of the new world.<br /><br />I plan to get this out public and published wherever I can before the riots start, and when they do, I'm going dark and disappearing until the time is right to make myself apparent.</p>
