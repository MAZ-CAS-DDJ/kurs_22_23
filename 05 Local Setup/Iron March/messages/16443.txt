	Hey, this isn't Odin, but this is Odin's roommate who got gassed because I converted to Islam. Do you have a Skype? I would be incredibly eager to speak with a Chechen, your people are incredibly inspiring in your fight against international Jewry. I love Chechen music so much, and learning about Caucasus leaders like the brave Imam Shamil.
