	Well it is all just a hypothetical situation anyways. But yeah really can't see without my glasses anyways. Also I have been thinking about it and I think I will reinstall the old republic again, just something to do in my free time between work uni and working out. This time after it installs I think I'll just leave it on wither I play it or not. You still play sometimes? To be honest I just like games were you can fight for authoritarian sides/factions. And yes this will be the last time I bring this up I swear. Unless you'd want to play sometime ha ha ha. Let me know if you get this and what you think.
