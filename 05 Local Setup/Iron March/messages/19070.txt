	&gt; You have the power in your choices to make video games "not an option" , You simply choose to use your free time for them, no one is forcing you to. Fascists should lead by example.

	What you are saying to would be perfectly valid if at any point I said that we are <em>forced</em> to play video games. I wish games were not an option due to us not having any free time, not because games are bad in and of themselves. Don't even try and tell me you don't have time to kill, because I know you browse forums. The time it took for both of us to argue about this could have been spent playing a game and it would not make a difference at all. Both are unnecessary things that we don't need to do, but choose to do simply recreationally since we <em>do </em>have time to kill.
