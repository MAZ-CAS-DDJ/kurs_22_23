<p>What's your email? You seem pretty clued up, especially with tech issues. I run tech security for National Action, I can always do with helping hands.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for NA proper, speak with your contact. I've only been involved for a bit but was glad to see serious NS and wanted to put my efforts to use as a security enthusiast.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regarding bushcraft, foraging is my speciality and come next Spring we should hopefully have some camping trips focussing on teaching these skills- so you'll be needed in that department.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for stickers, I'll ask around but that's not something I know much about. Your NA contact, when you meet, will provide you with some if you ask.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope these others who are interested are as dedicated and it's good to see you are bringing something to the table.</p>
