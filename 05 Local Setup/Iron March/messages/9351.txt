<p>You melt my black fascist heart. They are truly lucky to be surrounded by your warmth and love, as your own children will be. They will grow from those fat little babies to strong youth, the spring of the world. The service you perform should be held with the esteem of the warrior's! The world does not percieve this value, a value far greater than all the gold in the world, and that is why we fight!</p>
<p>I can also see why you said you want to steal them in the other thread, I'm sure you're a better mother than any of theirs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, thank you for reminding me why I want a family. Pity on those poor souls who would rather be "financially independent" or continue the worst behavior of their youth rather than fufill a biological imperative.</p>

<p>"You will have my presence and readership as long as I have internet access"</p>
<p>As long as I have internet access, Emma, I will send you my work. I think we are linked in some mystical fashion, too much is similar between us for it to be otherwise. Not only do I want to appreciate this, I want to discover the source of our unity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'll sleep now, to pleasant dreams of your presence.</p>
