			I compose and record my own cello metal music, a hybrid of folk, black metal, and classical. I'd link it to you, but it's under my real name, so I'd rather not do that, seeing as we just met. I actually haven't shared my music with anyone here on IM, even the ones I've known for a couple of years now. Perhaps sometime in the future, but not now. Nothing personal, just gotta be discreet.

			I also like to read books - from literature to history to sci-fi and fantasy - I love the works of Tolkein, for instance. I'm also a massive nerd who's way into stuff like World of Warcraft (used to play it on and off for about 6 years, then quit for good last fall, it was taking up too much time, but it was fun while it lasted) and Warhammer: 40,000. I still play the 40K game Dawn of War 2 from time to time, it's very fun.

		I'd love to hear it, but if it's under your real name, let's wait until we know each-other better first. I wouldn't expect you to give it out until I give out my full name.

		I like Tolkien, he's a beautiful writer. I can't talk much on the sci-fi stuff though. My tastes lean much more "history and fantasy." ...also I read occasional trashy romance novels. In my defense, there's literally a whole subgenre based around some girls having a "muscley honorable viking" fetish.Â <br /><br />
		You learned some of my interests in the thread, obviously. But: besides music, I like to read about politics. I'm a pretty voracious reader in general. Also, tennis is fun. And I like camping, I'm a nature-lover.
