<p>Hahndorf! I have some fond memories of that place from my teens. Had a good friend up there at the time, he moved into</p>
<p>interstate and I lost contact though.</p>
<p>I live in Para Hills - it's not bad but my accomodation there is temporary. I was living in the blighted wastes of Elizabeth previously for a long time - I was kind of a monastic, following an opt out strategy - solitary confinement in many ways, depressed, but never self loathing. It was foolish looking back, but then again, I thought it was already all over. Perhaps the environment coloured my pessimism. . .</p>

Most of my friends are apolitical. It seems like Australian youth just don't care and if they do they are peppy little liberals thinking playing hacky sack will change the world. And this love Aboriginals shit and shoved down our throats. They have their own tv station now which is a joke. We're made to feel guilty for bringing them civilization. I agree we should be careful who we let into our country. I hate this idea that we should open up our borders.</div></blockquote>
<p>It's so reckless and appalling isn't it? That the United states and the UK can still - somehow - be the model for the cleaner nations to take inspiration from!? Unbelievable. Every white country needs its 'black problem', and its 'muslim problem'? Have they learned nothing from the savage and schizophrenic USA or the sickly pink United Kingdom?? The left wing are truly self hating - they despise 'majorities', majorities to them are inherently oppressive, ergo, they actually want Australian whites to be minorities, that is the agenda and they think it is 'good'. "Right-wing" is basically used as a euphemism for "Bad-people".</p>
<p>So yeah, Nationalism needs invigorating. Alot of folks here think it's going to take a militant niche to save the day but I think the only way it can be done is <em>by mainstreaming the niche</em>, not radicalising it even further. You need good soil before strong roots can grow. Sowing seeds is the least i can do, perhaps, sadly, the most too. I'm actually quite good at it.</p>
<p>As for political activity or radical sub cultures, I've never met up with radical nationalist / racialist groups in Australia - I kind of anticipated the dissapointment you spoke of in advance I guess. I was a kind on anarchic-libertarian in my teens. Verily, I've never met someone I truly admire (unless they're genuinely well meaning, bright eyed, well constituted and completely ignorant - sometimes i admire/envy their ignorance!). I'm not trying to be arrogant, it's a confession, not a boast. :\</p>
<p>So, are you working, unemployed or studying? I'm at uni (Adelaide) but I'm pretty unimpressed with the place. I am doing a Bachelor of Arts though - not psych or the hard sciences - so I guess that's kinda self inflicted. It's totally anti-everything rich, glorious and noble - it's like playschool for grown ups, the morality of the rabbit reigns supreme, and everyone's a bore.</p>
<p>I could rant at length about how unbelievably fucked the humanities are. From 'The Social Life Of Excrement' in Anthropology to the indignation i caused when during a tutorial session on the Conquest of the Americas, in regard to Hernando Cortez, after everyone else had testified to their 'goodness' (for that's all that 'higher education' is these days) - "Racism", "Colonialism", "Greed", "Psychopathy", "Bigotry", "(even) Genocide" etc, - I simply stated that <em>I didn't feel qualified to judge a man of his caliber</em>. I quit both politics and history in disgust in my first year to focus soley on philosophy. It's the only faculty there that seems to value strong drink, so long as it's clear and concisely poured.</p>
