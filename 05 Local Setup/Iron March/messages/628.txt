<p>I have a journal promoting Fascism called, "Reaktion!" it could definitely use a proof reader as I fail at it. If you want to read the current three issues</p>
<p>Fascist Archive (top right)</p>
<p>Journals</p>
<p>Reaktion!</p>
<p>From where do you hail? And for the record, I'll always take submissions. There is another journal called Attack! which is also good.</p>
