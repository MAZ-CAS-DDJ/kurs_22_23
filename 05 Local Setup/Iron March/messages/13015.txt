	Oh thank you!

	I have messaged her already actually but she is yet to respond.

	Thats interesting, my husband is still in the states too. He is yet to move over on his visa but we visit each other when we can. He has agreed to two more children for my sake. So that is a good start.

	Yes big families are better. You end up with heaps more cousins uncles and aunts too!

	Its good to have all those military skills. Does the Canadian military look after Canadians better than those in the USA military?

	It is good that you have a girlfriend, many men struggle finding a good woman these days. Portugal is probably more traditional than the west too?

	Agriculture sounds good, get into organic farming as there is a growing market for it! I hope to own a bit of land one day but only to feed ourselves. But I dont know how realistic it is yet.
