<p>lolololololololol stay clear of the Finnish mod then. The forum doesn't disallow trolling because yet again - not a hugbox. And will state this once more: the forum is not a movement, we don't promote the attitude "this is srsz bsnz goddamit" because otherwise one can end up like the NAMarkiddies.This is a forum, people commune and debate, where it's serious topics people automatically assume the appropriate attitude, where it's not - they go all out if they want. Doesn't really make anyone any less adult.</p>

<p>You do realize that this is a fascist forum so practically every single forum member has that stance, right? You're not discovering fire here, everyone's already got their IM-club issue lighters.</p>

<p>That's the purpose of the forum to begin with, to help people make movements and the likes. And you're not speshul in your desire to do something so don't insult the forum by saying "<em>but IIII, unlike these forum monkeys that can't act as adults, am going to actually DO something!</em>" Ben already runs a movement, Ritz is building his own movement up, Jacob runs a journal, I wrote a book and am ready to launch my own movement. Welcome to the club, please get a ticket and wait in line, your ticket number  221 - you'll be called when it's your turn.</p>

<p>I see you only have 16 posts. I suggest that you at least read the major topics on the forum, you'll discover that very few people have issues with violence. Also saying we got liberal forum users - what an insult!</p>

<p>You and everyone else out there, like that Christian Falangist Party of America lolcowtrain. Not to put you off your plans but we get to hear people brag about doing something without actually going through with their plans or dropping them somewhere midway because they lost interest in their little gameproject and then rationalize it with whatever excuses once too often. Don't do the talking part, just walk the walk if you can, what you can do instead of talking is asking for advice or materials and sources - that's the primary focus of this forum, to give aid in such endeavors when asked. But without the advertisements for it, nobody cares unless they see actual work being put in.</p>

<p>I'm Russian, it's a different world with a different political culture, asking me what's right for america is asking for a biased non-american opinion, because I only ever think in the context of what's right for Russia. I don't care for fucking rights because rights are not an integral part of Russian political culture, so it's right for Russia not to focus on de juro rights, but in the west rights are a corner stone of the political tradition.</p>
<p>Here's a topic on <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/656-russian-political-thought-and-tradition/" rel="">Russian political culture</a>, so that you know why one doesn't simply ask a person of another civilization what's good for his own culture.</p>
<p>And here's my <a href="http://slavros.org/en/?page_id=30" rel="external nofollow">work</a>, if you want to know my thoughts.</p>
