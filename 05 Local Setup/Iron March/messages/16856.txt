	Greetings. That's right, usually they are closing introduction threads on every Monday, but you posted yours on Sunday and you needed some more time, that's why it was closed today.

	I don't like that, but the guys aren't too strict when it's about this questions. As soon as you post the first message in your intro you can go to other topics as well (it would be nice if new members would be able to post in those only after their intro were closed), so you didn't miss anything.

	I meant the resolution of the face.
