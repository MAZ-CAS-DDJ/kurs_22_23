<p>Im sorry it took so long to see this, compleatly new to this site and haven't checked it so much, but I entered the site you sent me right now, will probably look around a little for the next days =)</p>
<p>Can I ask you what you think of nationalism? why this is better then ex all countries under one flag?</p>
<p>I hear all the time by communist who say: "Countries are formed by the capitalist elite to keep workers without power" and many other quotes similar to that.</p>
<p>I have recently think that maybe nationalism isn't such a bad thing? Is it wrong to support your country and the culture you have love for? Is it wrong to feel proud of that?</p>
<p>What is your opinion on this?</p>
<p>(I have nothing against other races btw)</p>
