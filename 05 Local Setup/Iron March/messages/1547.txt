<p>I'm looking behind you right now, comrade. I'm looking behind you and I see a hallway that stretches to eternity. There are thousands of men there hung by the neck. They wear black uniforms. I can see the rusted Totenkopf sewn upon their caps.</p>
<p>And they died, they died for the same dream that I am living right here, right now. I can see them as far as the eye can see and they are smiling at us. We are the heralds of the second coming.</p>
<p>The Imperium is built upon corpses and sanctified with bloodshed. The world with war is torn. And each drop of precious blood is dripping within the holy goblet from which those before us drank.</p>
<p>We will guard Europa's ancient flame, raising our bloodred standards while marching towards conquest and glory.</p>
