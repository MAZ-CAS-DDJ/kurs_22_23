<p>Man, if there's one thing I'm not doing, it's cleaning bathrooms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You crashed your car? Fuck, reminds me of my brother. His car caught on fire after it crashed in the freeway lel. Lost his new stereo because of it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My brother (well, half-brother) is a lot like me, too. He pretty much just lives off of his girlfriend's income, and the occasional odd-job I believe. He's a blue pill though, so while he resents the kike system, he knows nothing about it. He just says he doesn't want to work for "the man". He's 28.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My mother and father look down on his unemployment, but I guarantee he's way more content than either of my parents. I stay over at his place sometimes, we play video games and hang out. He's taking me to a concert on the 14th, he goes to shows in Austin and Dallas all the time. How often do you think my parents get to do that? Not fucking often.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have the belief I could probably find something to do that isn't demeaning or anything, I think I'll get lucky somehow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's probably because I have some safety nets, like I said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I live with my mom on the court's paper, but since I do online schooling, it's more half and half.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By the way, when that shit was being formalized, the court ruled that my mom didn't have to give my dad visitation rights. How fucked is that? No wonder kids today are shit, too many boys raised by their mothers. I was a twink for a lot of my school life because of that; an unmasculine father whom I only saw every other weekend, and a mother who bitched at me for breathing wrong. Result: fuccboi</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank God for fascism.</p>
