<p>When I discuss Corporatism, and the reasoning why National Syndicalism is impractical, at least at this time, I sometimes receive harsh criticism, despite the fact that the Corporatism I espouse has hard numbers (especially Korea under Park Chung-Hee and Portugal under Salazar) that show that such a system works quite well provided the Nation allows each individual Corporation a degree of flexibility. Many here want this to be 1920s Italy or Romania; it isn't, we live in an entirely different time and place. To march on the streets in militaria would push the public away; far better to appear as respectable, upright citizens with passion for the Nation and the ideas of our Founding Father Hamilton, Abraham Lincoln (hard to pull off in the South), Teddy Roosevelt, and the New Deal. Trying to push the ideas of foreign regimes will get you nowhere except among those who are already here.</p>

It is what happens when citizens quit working as individual cells and begin functioning like one organism. Fascism is more than Mussolini or Franco or what have you, it is, above all else, this kind of internal drive man has towards social order and group cohesion. The real fascist is selfless and does his duty with zeal simply for the glory and continual propagation of the State. There is no higher goal or aim. </div></blockquote>
<p>I couldn't have said it better myself and am passing this quote along to a few Facebook and personal contacts now (you'll be anonymous unless you want me to credit you). While true the cult of the Hero can be a powerful rallying point or banner, the most important goal is to treat society as a living being that all its members are responsible for the health of. I care nothing to be the leader, but if no one else presents themselves then I will lead. Even then the Nation is a far higher ideal than I myself. This is another reason why I prefer the Italian system to the German system; I've never been a fan of Fuherprinzip.</p>
