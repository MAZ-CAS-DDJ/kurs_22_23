	In the thread "Study Proves Blacks are Not People", you quoted 'StopWhiteGenocide'/'GeneralFranco' 's video 'Nordic Frontier #03: The Lauritz Interview'. Quoting images and videos when they appear on the same page clutters up the forum much like multiposting, and is against the forum guidelines. I edited your post so the video wouldnt be quoted anymore.

	I've been telling people not to do it constantly for the last year, to the point where I'm telling people not to do it multiple times per day, and I don't feel like doing that anymore because it's a waste of my time and further clutters up the forum when im always typing the same thing over and over again.
