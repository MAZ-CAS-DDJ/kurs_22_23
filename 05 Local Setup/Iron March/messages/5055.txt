<p>Nice one; thanks for the indepth reply. I'll slowly ease back in to pagan posting and concepts, I can't just jump back into it without making some people look stupid or getting pissed off with me "tricking" them. I'm about a 1/4 through that book I linked you to and so far I can say it's blowing my mind.</p>
