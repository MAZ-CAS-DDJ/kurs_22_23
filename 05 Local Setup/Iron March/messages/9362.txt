<p>Morning, dear. A new day, a new dawn! I'm happy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I might just have to come snatch you then, in my longship with my merry band of warriors <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>I don't have a car, I drive my dad's Honda Civic usually. In a perfect world I would own a 1970s Porsche 911, like the one my sister's boyfriend has. In an imperfect world I would go for some kind of van, lots of things you can do with that, or maybe a souped-up Volkswagen Golf racer, my sister's boyfriend has one of those too and it's awesome. What about you?</p>

<p>Who doesn't love food? Especially Italians like us. I'm still sore about my shitty breakfast, I was in such a rush.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I love boots, I've got too many. Though recently I've been more partial to adidas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We should go curbstomping sometime, it'd be romantic <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wub.png" alt=":wub:" /></p>
