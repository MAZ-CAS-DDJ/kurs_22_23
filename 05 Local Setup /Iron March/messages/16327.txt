	I dont like too much of the stuff he released after prison either tbh. Some of his ambient stuff is pretty good, and I like Heil Odin, but beyond that, I dont listen to much of the post jail releases. I dont like much black metal beyond like, 1993. <br /><br />
	Also. fuck Mayhem. They had one good song (Freezing Moon), and Øystein Aarseth was a commie faggot.<br /><br /><br />
