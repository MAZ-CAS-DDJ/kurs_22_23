	So I have this thing called iFunny. So Ive heard of AtomWaffen from a few people. I have a couple question. (btw sorry to be a pain).  This is a very serious matter, I understand. So for a few months ago Ive always wondered about what I could do in my local area or country. To make my stand. Protect my Volk. A certain half of my family got into drugs, and poverty. No jobs etc... But they are recovering. I want to know what I could do to pick up a flag or join a group that helps me save my Volk. Im not being sattire. Im not exagerating. I didnt join Iron March Forums to just fuck around. I need to do something. My year anniversary of being a National Socialist is nearing. I am also 16. Turning 17 in September 5. I have a job and a vehicle for transportation.  I am ready for action. Im tired of sitting around. I am radicalized by seeing my society and family fall around me. Im done waiting.  Could you point me in the direction of stating somewhere? A group of taking action? AtomWaffen perhaps? I saw your posts. Thank you. Please respond when you get a chance.
