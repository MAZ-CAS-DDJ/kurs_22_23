<p>I almost think Christianity is the problem: as you said, much of the right wing continues to venerate the Jews as God's chosen and therefore is willing to fight for their right to Palestine. I know I was like that. Unless you take the Jew-worship out of Christianity or push anti-Christian sentiment, you're missing out on a group of people with guns who aren't afraid to use them. Good luck to you guys on tackling the 'America is a nation of immigrants' slogan too. 'e pluribus unum' is even on the seal. How do you suggest convincing the people?</p>
<p>I can recommend you some good webpages, if I can remember the links. A good book is definitely 'Liber Null and Psychonaut', from what I've heard, but I haven't yet read it. Ah, cool! You must be very good then. Isn't /pol/ a mess tho? That's all I've really heard about it. Still, it must be a good gateway drug, if some on here were originally on there. It's hard to find far right people where I am as well, because the ruin of the West is an abstract concept to those who can afford to live apart from the violent immigrants. There are lots of 'conservatives' in the South-East, but they're only conservative as far as taxes on them go.</p>
<p>You're so lucky to have family in the South! I've barely seen it, but what I saw really left an impression. Barely seen Germany either, but it can't be so different to Austria, which is an incredibly picturesque country (no patriotic bias *cough*). Really want to visit Russia too, to see if the Slavs indeed squat.</p>
<p>No problem! Meeting any sort of fascist is great, but the young, dedicated ones really give me hope. This is an excellent forum, and you're a very interesting, knowledgeable person. Your being a fellow Germanic doesn't hurt either. How much German can you speak?</p>
