	1. It depends on the age group. The faith is stronger in the older generations. The younger ones have more issues with some corrupt priests and shady dealings done by the church officials.  They haven't rejected God, only the men that pose as God's shepherds. I've yet to meet someone fully atheistic, only agnostic(neutral). As far as pagans go, no, we don't have any of these here as far as i know. If someone believes in tree fairies and other such nonsense they will most likely be mocked without end.

	Besides faith i also believe that the next important part in a nation is the nuclear family. So far we are doing ok despite mass-media non-stop degenerate propaganda. I see young people getting married, starting families and i don't see anyone rejecting marriage or any women claiming to be a feminist or other such non-sense. So far, we hold the line.

	2. We are not a slavic people. We have some slavic elements and influence, but that's it. We believe and we have proof that we are latinized dacians(or getae, it's the same thing) at the core. This is why we can understand and share many similarities with the romance languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages</a>).

	3. Our economy is slowly growing. It just depends on what field you work in. Our minimum wage is something like 180-200/month$.

	The most economic viable field of work in Romania is IT. It depends on the level of knowledge and experience but you start at roughly 400-500/month$ and can go over 2000-3000$/month on average.
</p>

<p>
	Other fields of work, on the other hand are doing badly. One of the things that pissed me off and got me in this movement was the fact that due to poverty and government corruption more and more peasants are selling their land. My country is slowly being sold to foreign interests and we'll end up slaves on our own land.
</p>

<p>
	One thing that gives me hope is the cyclical nature of history and the fact that, if history is to repeat itself, Romania will soon go into another fanatic stage similar to the legionnaire movement.
