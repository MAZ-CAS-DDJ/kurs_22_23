<p>Oh hey they put up with me enough! Haha</p>
<p>The thing is, I figure the British scene is somewhat different. I'm aware of the general alt-right theme that's popping up in some circles. It's weird. Personally, I know plenty of the Brits are fans and/or involved in NatAction. The whole point of the alt-right is supposed to be a 'safe space'  to discuss generally fashy things. I know for a fact you have a lot to offer in that department, and if you're clever and reserved enough, can generate a decent narrative for many to follow. At least for some. </p>
<p>It's a weird time right now, isn't it? New alt-right/fashy narratives are developing all over the shop. From relatively mundane ones to full 14/88. I personally think we need that wide range of views. Some of the kids who listen to us might not have heard of National Socialism in any way. It would be good for them to hear about it properly, and in a friendly way. </p>
<p> I mean, if you look at the way The Right Stuff has evolved from the beginning, they're getting there. I certainly think it's developing a positive outlook. Then again, I just joke about current events on out podcast and other than that have minimal involvement. </p>
<p>I just really value your voice and thought it would be good in a group chat for people, especially millenials, to encounter your boys. </p>
<p> I'm fairly open on skype so my addy is dancrowley@live.com if you want to add me. I was on the ironskype a while ago but I'm not much of a talker do left. I've asked the lad if I can join again and sent him a contact request. </p>
<p> Up to you mate, I'm just interested in hearing your voice on subjects. </p>
