<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>thanks for your friendly concern. As far as my avatar is concerned I was looking for an humorous picture saying I wasn't active anymore for the moment. I found it...</p>
<p>Thing is I severely lack of free time to spend online these days, due to several (positive) changes both in my private and professional life. And the boards have developed in a way that I can't possibly follow - let alone monitor as a Mod or Admin - the numerous active threads here.</p>
<p>Thing is, I've also become put off by the fact a growing lot of people around display mindsets I've been avoiding all my life as an activist: neurotic conspirationists (jews ruling the world, yadda yadda yadda...), cardboard racial "geneticists" whose theories rely on internet rumors and would make even SS-Ahnenherbe scientists laugh, ultra-traditionalists who are the exact, loathsome pendant of feminazis, lowlife scum Breivik aficionados...well you get my drift. This kind of talk was voiced by a minority once, now it comes from an unchallenged majority. At the ripe age of 40-something I don't have the patience to challenge this stuff anymore, nor will I make the time to do so.</p>
<p>Furthermore we have local elections in mid-october, and I intend to do my part of real-time activism. We don't quite believe in a "Golden Dawn" miracle...but who knows? <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>I'm not leaving this place altogether and still keep an eye on things, but I'm just not in the mood to be much around right now.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway for your kind words.</p>
<p>Sieg heil!</p>
<p>WiB</p>
