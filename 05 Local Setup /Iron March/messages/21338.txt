	Thank you. Well, I started National Bloc as a free-lance group of Vanguard America, but got in a disagreement with Thomas, the commander, and left. A few weeks later, Vanguard America split into two groups and many of its members joined National Bloc. National Bloc was just going to be a TWP/Alt-Right movement, but recently, we've began to change our image to more of a radical National Socialist movement.
