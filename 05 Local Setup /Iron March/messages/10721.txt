<p>There is another argument out there I've encountered which is tirelessly spouted by the liberals. "Liberal Democracies defeated Fascism. Therefore Fascism is inferior"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don't even know what to say to that, because it's so stupid. Then I bring up the fact that the Soviet Union is more than responsible for the outcome of world war II, and that they were far from a Liberal Democracy. They come around and say "because they had help from the democracies"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this point I don't know what to say, I just want to physically attack them.</p>
