<p>I am going to sleep, but my thoughts now, though... You are really special Emma, and I'm very conflicted because I feel deeply for you though we've never met for real. I speak directly from my heart when I write these messages, genuinely what I think, and I can tell you do too - I like what I see.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You will be the perfect mother and I want to help you be that, be a part of that, yet I'm not even out in the world yet. I want you to be mine somehow yet I know the distance is so great and will grow greater soon. This is a big conundrum for me. I know we are just talking on a forum, I haven't even heard your voice and I shouldn't make too much of it, but I really want to be with you. I'm young, and I'm dependent under the roof of someone I despise, and I just don't feel worthy right now but this is what I have come to understand.</p>
<p>That we're meant to make something beautiful one day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Good night. As usual I'll drift off to the thoughts of your words.</p>
