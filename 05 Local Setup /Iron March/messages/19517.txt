	Hey, good to hear from you. Going to be honest, it could be going better, guys basically flaked out on me when it most mattered, started talk with 3 different guys who have some solid connections and existing businesses - and they all kind of just incompetent so I gotta do some thinking as to where to proceed as I don't want to subject myself or you guys to that. On a good note my side project is going to become my main project (making uniforms and chest rigs) as I secured about 40 Gs to get that started up but I'm really really busy this summer so I won't be able to do anything with that until next summer.

	Yeah so, in short, barring extraordinary circumstances I'm putting a hold on it and figuring out whether I need to just wait around for these guys or just do it myself.
