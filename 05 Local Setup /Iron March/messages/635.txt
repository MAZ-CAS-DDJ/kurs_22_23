<p>Hej, how are you my friend ?</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="202" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>.  Correct me if I am wrong, but you seemed to be a lover of languages as well.  How did this happen and what areas of linguistics or what languages family fascinates you the most? </div></blockquote>
<p>It happened because of my father, he is the real language lover in my family, so i grew up surronded by books about languages.</p>
<p>I think that is celtic languages that fascinates me the most, goidelic or brythonic, and after out of IE language, the Mandarin.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="202" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>I too spent some time as an anarchist, but one meeting was all I needed to see that those guys are more or less fine with anomie.  They wanted no social structure at all!  How is society to function?  Even chimps have a semblance of societal structure</div></blockquote>
<p>A lot of anarchists are more "rebellious teenager", ultra-individualists, nihilists, anomists than true anarchists.</p>
<p>For me, it was worst, most anarchists i knew was anarcho-communists, so with the antifascism, antiracism, the support of race-mixing,  israel or arabs ... pfff.</p>
<p>For example they even opposed to the family concept.</p>
<p>Nothing to do with real anarchy from the 19th century.</p>
<p>I agree that we have to rethink about it, because the mono-nuclear family with one child, it is degenerate most than chimp society, but no family at all, nonsense.</p>
<p>I think that anarchy is a good passageway, (to put things back flat; and to have the critical thinking) but we can not stay long anarchist</p>
<p>"this is in black flags that are made most beautiful shirts".</p>

While in many respects fascism is revolutionary, first and foremost we stand against the atomization of society.  The "oppressive" social roles of old gave us belonging and guidance.  Now, we don't need any ancient caste system, but if people realized how hedonistic and selfish their culture is and how rich and fulfilling history and tradition can be we'd no longer be society's bogey man.  We'd be its knight in shinning armor.</div></blockquote>
<p>I can't be more agree with you;</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="202" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Nations are homogenous by nature and states that do not align with the reality of nations find themselves on a sinking ship or (at best) a ship diligently manned by opportunistic rats. </div></blockquote>
<p>It was precisely the most failure in socialists republics.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="202" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div> I believe it was Heinrich Mann who in 1919 wrote something to the effect of: a people love their nation even greater in defeat than in victory.  This I believe is the true test of whether a man's feelings are true nationalism or pathetic patriotism.  Any man can march behind an advancing flag, but only a true folkish comrade puts his national pride over his or even the community's material gain.  Therefore, I opposed immigration as it assaults the principal building block of a good, folkish nation-state: homogeneity.</div></blockquote>
<p>Exactly,</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="202" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>I sympathize with your admiration of Switzerland.  Until my hard turn to the Right I was a great admirer of that confederation.  Truth be told, I still admire Switzerland, but whereas I used to see them as a model I now see them as a Alpine aberration.  Good breeding or something in the water (haha) have given them about two times the sense any other people have on average.  Is it possible that after the culture has reconnected with its roots and a folkish ethos permeates the people that they could be trusted with decision-making?  Maybe.  But I am more inclined to think that the lot of the average man is not to have a direct say in how his folk are lead.  Leave the business of ruling to rulers.  Whether a society's ideology accepts or not is immaterial.  The elites will reign.  The choice is either to muddle the culture with inherently individualistic ideas such as democracy or make the status of citizen something worth striving for.</div></blockquote>
<p>I am against such thing like the right to vote, but petitions, control rights, right of inspection, right to propose, at less at the local level and for citizens/workers; why not ? </p>
<p>If we select well, even a simple citizen would be from the elite.</p>
<p>I think  give citizenship only to fathers of families, with "pure" blood with both racial and eugenist standards, without any criminal antecedent, having performed their military service, having a job, after psychological and pyschotechnical testing  ...</p>
<p>Obviously, with this select, no homosexuals, drug addicts,  or young or old retarded.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="202" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Ah, I did not notice that your system was one without currency.  Don't you think that would be a bit impractical?  Currency isn't a Western invention.  Cultures all over the world independently developed some form of currency to expedite trade and make it easier to manage wealth.</div></blockquote>
<p>I didn't say without currency, of course it is suitable, but a new form, a currency exchange, without any value in itself, so no thing like interest or usury that create values from nothing.</p>
<p>A return to the standard.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="202" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>In sentiment I agree with everything you said here.  But at the end of the day, no one environment satisfies the wants or needs of its inhabitants.  Even if we went back to nations eating their local, traditional cuisine and wearing garments made from animals now local to their land, how would Japan avoid serious famine and a massive deterioration in their standard of living?  How would Belgium, whose soil is richer in coal and iron than wheat and timber, eat and have shelter and how would my native Indiana, with its vast resources of corn and limestone, power our houses and build airplanes?</div></blockquote>
<p>That is why my system is subsidiarist, is the local level is not sufficien, we refer to the upper level with a planified market;</p>
<p>Belgians must sell coal and iron to indiana in exchange for corn and limestone for example. There is no problem. So you can build your airplanes ^^</p>
<p>Like the third reich international economy : exchange and not a free market. Nothing utopic.</p>

<p>like the actual system of liberalism <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>I think he is more for a pluriculturalism view.</p>

While I am no pagan yet, it is an honorable and noble tradition.  The world would be better off with more pagans.</div></blockquote>
<p>And best with only pagans <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
