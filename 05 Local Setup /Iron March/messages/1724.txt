<p>I simply fail to understand how Judaism disqualifies one from feeling of National Pride or loyalty. Then I've also heard about who's secretly a Jew, who isn't, why ZOG is real and why Jews hate 'goyim' a hundred times over. It's become childish to say the very least. Anyone who doubts that Jews can be loyal should take a look at the Jews who served the Ottoman Turks and Safavid Persia.</p>
<p>I doubt Jews will ever die as a whole, the resilience of the Jewish People amazes me. Where Neoplatonism, Manichaeism, and (practically) Zoroatrianism all vanished, Judaism retained it's character.</p>
<p>And no offense taken at all. Traditional religions tend to feel kindred in regards to service. I also attend Orthodox services here and there, the Arab Liturgy is actually amazing as is the Greek one.</p>
