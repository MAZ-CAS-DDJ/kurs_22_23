<p>Sooo, </p>
<p>Looks like you're settling in here rather well.</p>
<p>I noticed you here Tuesday night (I was lurking) but didn't see you at the 'Day Care Centre' on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hope you're well and just 'Red Pilling' rather than ill.</p>
<p>Though, after 40+ pages of Liberal Degeneration, I wouldn't be surprised. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>I'll try to log in here more often if only to use the PM system here, and I'll get my Skype and Steam happening too.</p>
<p>I've been too solitary for too long (even online) methinks.</p>
<p>Time to reintegrate a little.</p>
