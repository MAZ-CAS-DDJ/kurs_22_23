<p>I must say that all sounds great!  I especially liked the multi-person executive.  I've always felt that was the surest way to run a nation.  I still prefer cooperatives over syndicates, but I am certainly going to look more into syndicalism now.  I'm also glad you left farming to farmers.  Collective farms are a disaster!</p>
<p>Your qualifications for citizenship seem to favor brawn over brains.  Would you consider working in a hospice as hard labor?  Would education be a state mandated field, as long as the teachers-to-be were model citizens?  I am not sure how I feel on putting possible political qualifications on membership in the officer corps.  I agree that officer and citizen should be synonymous, but someone that is promoted to an officer should automatically become a citizen, not vice versa.</p>
<p>What level of freedom of expression are you comfortable with?</p>
