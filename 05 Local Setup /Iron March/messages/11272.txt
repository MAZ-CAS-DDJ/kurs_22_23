<p>My taste in genre of ideology is pretty diverse and encompasses virtually everything with the two notable exceptions of rap and country both of which I dislike. In fact on my iPod shuffle pretty much all my friends can find something they like except for the swagfags and wiggers at my middle school :/</p>
