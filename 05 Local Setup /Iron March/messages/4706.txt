<p>I know that feel bro. But one day, I thought "What if I'm missing out something not going out clubbing?" I went clubbing, did a lot of drugs, and found out it's not all that cool or fun. I found out the best way is to chill and blaze it with bros. That is really the best way. Safe enviroment, and people you trust 100%.</p>

<p>If only it was, my friend. As a mod I have access to delicate information. At some point we did massive culling to hide incriminating threats from the feds to protect Torrent.</p>

<p>It's cool bro, I try to check IM at least weekly. I don't have all that good access to the internet and when I do, I don't pay much attention to it outside of blasting music.</p>
