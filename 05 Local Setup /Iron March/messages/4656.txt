<p>I'm a Right Wing Republican in the sense that I believe in Roman Republican values. Family, duty, honor, and vibrant patriotism are all things I cherish. I'm sickened by the fact that our republic has lost these values and we have degenerated into pieces of shit that can't think beyond our carnal pleasures. In a sense, you can call me a Traditional Conservative in  that I have respect for high culture and community.</p>
<p>I do like fascist ideals though. The idea of the state being a natural entity that should serve to awaken the spirit within man is something that appeals to me also. I think Fascism also has a neat culture of Roman salutes and marches along with it's strong sense of patriotism.</p>
<p>However, the only thing I divert with Fascism on is it's dictator worship. A good Government to me is one that lasts, and no fascist government has lasted past the 20th century. Dictators aren't efficient forms of governments in my opinion. Therefore I adhere to Republicanism in creating a balance between dictatorship, the aristocracy and the people. I know it risks degeneration but it is better to have some state than no state.</p>
<p>What about you? What are you opinion on Governments?</p>
