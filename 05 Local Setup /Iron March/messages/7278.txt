<p>Yeah, i was in an alternative school for about half of my 7th grade year, that sh*t isn't any fun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And at the moment, i'm nowhere near being able to graduate early, i'm actually behind. But i plan to get on the ball and not only catch up, but if i can, get ahead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyways, what else is new?</p>
