<p>Okay, so the events contributing to the reasons why I will be on hiatus and why my account is compromised.<br /><br />1. I was arrested. They actually came to my house, threatened my parents, and threatened me. I had to come down to the police station and explain the situation, and I have been warned that they are watching my activity and tracking my posts. They cannot track the messages because they don't have the capability to hack the site. This I know.<br />2. I have been forced by the school and PD to attend counseling. Said bitch, Em Giering, has filed a no-contact, restraining order on me, which somehow justifies <em>her</em> constant pestering and inciting of violence towards me. She is also using all the information she can gather from the public sections of this forum to tell everyone, including this counselor, who despite his claims of non-bias and personal freedom is still using her for information, and is now browsing the forum himself and challenging me on everything I have ever said. This counselor has actually encouraged me to "be gay", or "be transgendered" in an effort to be "oppressed". Because the attacks I've been receiving and the death threats are justifiable because I am a fascist.<br />3. I was attacked yesterday by three people who started vandalizing my car while I was in it. When I got out, I got slashed up the arm. I disarmed one of these guys' baseball bats and slammed it into his ribs. They ran off and carried him. I should've beaten the shit out of them and dragged them all to the station. The police have refused to do anything about this incident, and my parents' only concern about this, the ONLY concern about this was that the car was damaged because <b><i><u>I</u></i></b> am inciting hatred. Because the message <u><em><strong>I </strong></em></u> express is enough reason for people to behave the way they are.<br />4. People close to me are being threatened and are taking action. They too have been turned down by both the school and the police. We all plan to take it to the Institute for Justice or the ACLU, and if that doesn't work we're taking it to whatever media we can find. The journalists can have a field day.<br />5. Basically, everything I do is now compromised. I have options. Few of them are beneficial. Even my Girlfriend, as liberal has she was, has become much more respecting and is starting to identify with Fascism, because she has taken to hear the threat of Cultural Marxism. So while she is encouraging action, very little of it will help. She is also unwilling to publicly associate me, so she's about as scared of society as anyone else.<br /><br />As I said before, there are plenty of people who have gotten redpilled because of my actions and words. But it means nothing when anyone else can flash the victim card. <br /><br />6. Speaking of my parents, the mere concept that I even *think* of fascism is now wrong, and I've brought everything on myself, apparently. In short, my parents went full shill and now <em><strong>literally</strong></em> hate me. Even my brother has been alienated from me, despite his objections and his understanding of things <em>AS A CHILD</em> rejects what is going on as wrong and as far as I know is being rejected now for it.<br /><br />This <em>IS</em> the far-reaching effects of cultural marxism and actively posting words is not going to help me contribute anything. These people are actively stalking me, attacking me, hurting me, hurting people around me, and they are saying "i'm doing it to them" by simply existing. By flashing the victim card.<br /><br />I'm not certain that they won't be tracking activity to have figured that I'm online right now. They probably have. This is what's going on, and I hope you can use the information to your benefit. Not asking for advice. I'm pretty sure the best course of action right now is to write, and prepare for what comes next.</p>
