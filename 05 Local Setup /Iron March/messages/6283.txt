<p>Yup, I was running that quest on /tg/ aka autism central. I just kinda ran with my homebrew chater that was going to be fleet based but not anymoure i guess. I was working on the wiki to help the quest run more smoothly. Just havent had time or solid wiking skills. If you want to help out though that would be fun.</p>
