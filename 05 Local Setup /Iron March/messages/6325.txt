<p>I find Pentti Linkola, <span>Ted Kaczynski</span> and Pol Pot are/were fascinating individuals. I show some interest in Anarcho-primativism and deep ecology as well. I would say environmentalist movements are left leaning. Pentti is called "fascist" but he does not seem to be that much of a nationalist. He opposed multiculturalism. Check out his site. Ted was very critical of leftism. I recommend reading his manifesto. I read it ages ago but I remember he made a few good points. Pot Pot's Cambodia was a failed social experiment but even so he had some interesting ideas. He was also a extreme nationalist. Apart from economics his views were more like a form of Fascism then a form of Marxism-Leninism. I feel the environmental/anti-technology views of these individuals are to extreme. I recommend reading about them.</p>

<p>State propaganda can preach a message of ruralism. The means of production will be government and/or regulated by the government. There will be private property but people will have to obey the law. The law will enforce environmentalism. It will work in a South African Volkstaat the same way it worked in past Fascist/NS nations.</p>

<p>I feel it is a good philosophy a man is not meant to live in a urban society. Just compare pollution filled cities to the beauty of nature. Orania is environmentalist and people there live a more agrarian life. The word "boer" even translates to "farmer". Nationalism and National Socialism are by nature enviromentalist. A love for the fatherland not only implies a love for the race but a love for the land. The National Socialists used the term "blut und boden". Fascist Italy also glorified a rural life. Hungary and Japan as well. I would like to live in a society that instead of having cities people will instead live a rural lifestyle. Advance technology will still exist as I am not anti-techology. I do not advocate taking people out of cities over night like Pol Pot did but people need to live in an environmentalist nation that instead of living in bourgeois cities gets back to nature.</p>
