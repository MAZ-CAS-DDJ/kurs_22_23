	A few I suppose I was really amazed when i was a kid and I saw stormtroopers and the first moment I saw Vader walk across the screen and just CHOKE MY SHIT UP FAM I was like that's real power, I was just taken by the sheer commading and imposing will of his power on the screen. The way he just commanded things to be done. The order of the Stormtroopers the way they were a faceless force that was in control ( similar to Slavro's post on the black mask).
