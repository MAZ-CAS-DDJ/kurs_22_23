	I appreciate your patience. In your post about AtomWaffen you stated that if you dont want to get  things done done, then dont bother showing up. I am not trying to be some stupid person, going where I dont belong. I might sound dumb. But I want to take action. Anyway, is there a place or website where I could get started/connected with members? Btw I live in Ohio amd Im 16.
