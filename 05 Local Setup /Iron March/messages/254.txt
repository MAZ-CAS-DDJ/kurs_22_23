<p>Hey,</p>
<p>in the interests of keeping 'Why Fascism is Ridiculous' on topic, I'd just like to address your statement that 'might makes right' and your beliefs regarding 'Judeo-Christian' values. I couldn't think of a place to put it on the forum, so I'm just PMing you.</p>
<p>First, how do you reconcile your religious beliefs with the fact that A: God's chosen people are the Jews, and both the Bible and world history indicate that He has no interest in having them conquer anybody (or as a result, in favouring the winning side), and B: according to Jesus, the two commandments which supersede everything else in the entire Bible are to love God with everything you've got and to show as much love for everybody else, friend or foe as you do for yourself?</p>
<p>Secondly, if might makes right, and fascist capitalism is the best way, then why hasn't it won already? If might really makes right, then international liberal (in both senses of the term) capitalism is the best system, because it won, defeating fascism at every turn. By your logic, you should be grateful you haven't been put in jail for posting on dissenting websites like Iron March.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas,</p>
