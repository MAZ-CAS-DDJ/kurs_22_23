	Hey,
</p>

<p>
	So I believe that you are really religious, so this is why i'm asking you about this question.
</p>

<p>
	I've been an "atheist" basically my whole life. Denmark is not a religious country at all, no one I know ever go to church. So that's why I've never believed in god, what so ever.
</p>

<p>
	But, recently a friend of my family passed away, and I went to the funeral. I was vary sad, because this women often took care of me when I was a little kid. I've been to 6 funerals so far in my life (all of my grandparents, and then this women and her husband who died 6 years ago). So while I was sitting there in the church at this women' funeral,<b>Â  </b>the cantor (sorry if thats not what he is called) began singing Ave Maria, I thought to myself "why has there been so much death in my life?". And I got this feeling inside that I simply cant explain, I've never felt that way in my life before. I can't find any other reason for this feeling, then god himself.
</p>

<p>
	So my question is, what should be my first step to becoming a respectable Christian?
</p>

<p>
	Best regards
</p>
