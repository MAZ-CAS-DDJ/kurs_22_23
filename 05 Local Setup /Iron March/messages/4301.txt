<p>Very interesting perspective as usual Mierce, thanks, I'll do a lot more refreshing myself. I agree on every opposing point to catholicism and their supposed tradition because there's no older and more original tradition than the bible itself yet they do everything they can to avoid following it. They're like the Jews in that they prefer to talk about the politics of the day and wrap themselves up bueracratic, boring and borderline talmudic/autistic laws.</p>
<p>A state without religion and spirituality seems inconceivable to me, secularism is boring and bueracratic and the atheists are just as dogmatic as liberation theologists etc, what they have to offer or have offered has also been unimpressive and only built on the shoulders of religion, namely Christianity, protestantism/calvinism in particular - true science. It deals with the problems (or politics) that do actually matter. Secularism on the other hand introduces law and politics that are as talmudic, boring, relativist and as lengthy as you can get, that's part of the reason I've got a bitter taste over politics. Think about it, the only thing Christians refer to is the bible, and then look at all of the contradictory books and legislation politicians carry on hand to refer to.</p>
<p>I seem to recall you saying you were raised as a Jehovah's Witness. It's interesting you say that because so was I, I stopped going to meetings when I was 14. My parents and grandparents were fairly moderate so I didn't have the threat of being thrown out or being cut off, luckily. Never seemed right to me, I found it to be a no fun allowed religion and always saw innocent people getting disfellowshipped and blatantly guilty people being reinstated. Needless to say their history of inaccurate translations and their bad track record for making predictions and out of context scripture quoting in the watchtower didn't do them any justice either.</p>
