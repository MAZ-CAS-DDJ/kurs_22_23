<p>idk if you are really in the usa or know much about antifa here, but it you started a convincing local antifa group you could probably join the torch antifa network.  its run by a zionist jew in los angeles.  i think they meet every summer in chicago.  honestly though, antifa in the usa are pretty weak and it doesnt take much to overwhelm them.  youd just want to focus on flash demos rather than announce some sort of march that they could bus in activists for.</p>
