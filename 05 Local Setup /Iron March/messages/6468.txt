We can comment on each others blog posts – get a bit of intelligent conversation going, regardless of whether we agree/disagree. Hopefully we can look out for other likeminded British blogs, and build a little British New Right blog-network.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">This is a good blogger I suspect to be British. He hasn’t posted for a bit (although I believe he may have been headhunted by Greg Johnson of Counter-Currents.)</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">This lad’s bright and articulate, though overdoes it with the intellectualism (apparently part of some deliberate strategy I’m sure will fail… I’m going to try talking sense into him.)</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">I’m sure we can slowly find new blogs and integrate them into our fledgling network – and once we do we can forge similar links with our foreign counterparts. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">As of late I’ve noticed a budding pseudo-Traditionalism/Identitarianism phenomena on facebook and Tumblr. For the most part these people lack any depth of understanding when it comes to Traditionalism (and to a lesser extent, the European New Right), but they’re clearly receptive. It may be early days but I genuinely think the nationalist Right is increasingly turning away from mindless racial-hostility, and towards a genuine love of all things European and traditional. We’ll see.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">And I took what you had to say re: NA on board. Although on the Reds point, some of the lads went to a protest in London not long ago and were confronted by a larger group of self-described communists and anarchists. So that’s not entirely anachronistic.</span></span></span></p>
