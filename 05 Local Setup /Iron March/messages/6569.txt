<p>Yeah, the drug thread, this is another major embarrassment. They all look to me like 17 year olds I see here who try coke for the first time and think they're some "heroes" and want the entire world to know about that. I'm 25 years old, many of my friends do a lot of coke, I don't condone it in any way and I'm lucky not to ever touch this stuff. I'm not moralizing about it but it's wrong. On the other hand I'm really drinking too much alcohol, having to drink 0,5+l of vodka to get drunk, I admit it, but I'm not going to brag about it on a forum about it.</p>

<p>I guess coke and other drugs seem cool when you're a teenager but when it becomes a habit and when you see how it destroys people around you you'll think different.</p>

<p>Sometimes it seems to me that the entire point of this forum is to prove to people that they're not like Stormfront WNs, they're like some rebellious youth in relation to SF.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you want add me on FB if you want to chat, I have a feeling I'm going to get banned here soon</p>
