	We sometimes cooperate with OWP. As for ONR, formally we don't have anything in common. As you probably now, Falanga was formed by split-off members from ONR. On local level we hold some events together but there is still some hate between our organisations. As for NOP, we used to work closely together, but now we stopped since NOP became pro-Ukrainian. Also, some of the NOP guys went to Falanga. All of the groups are anti-kike, but ONR is not so upfront about it, since they worry about their presentability and PR.
