	Not really. I don't discuss religion with them often and when I do it's Christianity with my mum and how she should be a good christian and hate gays etc. She called me a bible thumper even though I wouldn't call myself christian. She has seen me reading many pagan books and know I'm interested in it, but she probably thinks it's just a history thing.
