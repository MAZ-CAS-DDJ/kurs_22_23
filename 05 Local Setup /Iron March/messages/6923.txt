<p>The pro-europe ones wish to keep things as they are, inside the EU with austerity measures etc</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SYRIZA wants to stay in the EU but keeps talking about "Union of the European people" and all that populist stuff. Other than that he wishes to make the country a liberal hellhole</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then there is G.Dawn which you probably already know about</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then with 5% each is the Communist party (which is more Stalinist than anything)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>ANEL (Independent Greeks) who are your typical pro-Russia and eurosceptics (though they don't to quit the union either). They are also populist as fuck and sort of the only major right-wing party in Greece after G.Dawn (though they are sinking cause people leave them for G.Dawn)</p>

<p>So... are Grey Wolvs a big deal in Turkey or are they blown out of proportion? Also, are they Turanist or Ottomanists?</p>
