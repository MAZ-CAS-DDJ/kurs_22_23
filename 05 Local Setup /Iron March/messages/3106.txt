<p>It's coming. My businesses have taken a hit since Obango was re-elected and I'm going to have to fork out thousands of extra dollars now thanks to the socialized healthcare that passed so I'm in a rough patch but I have a pretty big deal going through at the end of the month that should land me enough cash to cover your fee and all of my other expenses. These are the perilus days of Obamaunism.... No businessman is safe. I'll message you as soon as the money comes in to discuss how to transfer it over to you.</p>
