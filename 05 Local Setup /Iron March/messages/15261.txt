	At no point am I being charged with anything, I have not committed an offence, they can't even come up with a non-binding pre-charge. They are expanding the investigation by combing my computer for the next two and a half months for anything they can find.

	Police in England and Wales are not tied to procedure like US cops as long as it gets them results - they will either suceed or fail miserably. Just to give an overview - My arrest was false, the search was SUPER illegal (they were looking for alex and justified the raid and my arrest based on his case, his name and offence is on the search sheet of my flat), there was no itemised list of what they took, denial of trade (they stole all my camera and equipment even though it had nothing on it). I was locked up 20 hours and and this was done on the basis that my fingerprints were on an "stop aids" sticker placed outside a LGBT centre. On the day of my arrest they find CCTV footage that exhonerates me of any crime. I am bailed for two months, come back and they are now looking for material likely to incite racial hatred. So that is three separate junctures, it is laughable.

	They will be doing their best to find something, if they fail I can sue them for ridiculous money.
