<p>Driving is fucking awesome, I was inspired by my friend's old Volvo 242 I drove today, the engine is a beast! That is a good thing to say at the wheel.</p>

<p>If a girl as pretty as you came into my shop asking for D'Annunzio and Evola I would do more than profess undying love, I would steal her and take her home with me <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>Today I helped my friend and his mother with their garden (the rose above) after staying over for the night. His father made the best eggs benedict I've ever had. Then we drove over to my place, and I did some homework. Tomorrow is school, ugh, but at least I'll have the gym to look forward to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And you'll have your beautiful little babies to see!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Good night &lt;3</p>
