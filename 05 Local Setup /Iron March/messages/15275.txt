	Just saw the DS article on JW, also talked about it with Zeiger. It's said that JW is supposed to interact with the Coincidence Detector - is that something in the works or something that is already available somehow, in which case how do you activate that, as I have the detector but never seen it turn into links.

	Anyway, cheers on the DS reveal of the project, soon enough you might get your own SPLC articleÂ <img alt=":handy:" data-emoticon="" src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/handy.png" title=":handy:" /></p>
