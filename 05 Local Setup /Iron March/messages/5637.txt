<p>Torren really only does pot and psychedelics (one a week maybe) 'not addictive' they say, but he is such a bastard he is pretty much immune to everything anyway. He takes morphine but only for his back when it hurts - which can bring him to tears at times, he slipped a disk. </p>

<p>He is a special case - there is no basis for comparison. Myself on the other hand, I have had a life not too unlike your own or at least am in a similar position. I think if I survive this I will be changed forever, maybe into something better. If that is the case, you need to take your baptism of fire as well. </p>
