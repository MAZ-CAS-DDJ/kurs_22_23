<p>Well, I'm still interested. I'm ill right now, so the next few days are perfect. Also you can me on facebook or join the Nationalist Study Group (a private group) Jake and I started. My name is Joe Wearden and I have blond hair and glasses if you plan on going that route to distinguish from others with my name. Otherwise call me or let me know when I should call you. I've been organizing less, personal tragedy in life, but I remain vigilant.</p>
