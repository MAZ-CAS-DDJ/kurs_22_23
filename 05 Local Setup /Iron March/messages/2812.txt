<p>Interesting. Tell me more?</p>
<p>I tend to the view that a welfare state props up the weakest members of society, the ones who should be actively discouraged from reproducing, etc. and also protects them from the consequences of their own actions. On a personal level, I have interest in subsidizing the laziness of others. There are *always* jobs available. They may not be ones you want to do, but when you have no employment, you shouldn't be picky. Regular work provides structure and encourages personal discipline: welfare does not.</p>
