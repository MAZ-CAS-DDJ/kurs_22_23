<p>I'm certainly interested in some N-A style activism. You're located in Alberta if I recall correctly. I'm in a town called Kelowna which is about 4.5 hours from Vancouver but I usually visit Vancouver a few times a year. I'm currently a bit limited in when I can travel if we're meeting up somewhere since I'm studying at a university.</p>

<p>BTW I saw you posted in the Azov battalion thread. I looked into it as well earlier but they do not accept Canadians and at the time at least they were even turning away some Europeans who did not have military experience (I guess they've been doing well for recruits). We should keep in mind to have enough money stashed away for a plane ticket to Kiev if things take a turn in the future though.</p>
