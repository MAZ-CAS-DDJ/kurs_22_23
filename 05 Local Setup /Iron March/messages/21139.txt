	Hail, just planning the trip an flights to Kiev, do you know if there's any warm-up or afterparty planned?

	My friend was there in 2016, he said they visited the AZOV recruitment centre, personally I'd like to see something too rather than flying there for one day, will there be some interesting opportunities?

	Also, are you directly and personally involved in the festival organisation? I'm a concert photographer, if you wanted some photos I could bring my camera there. In case you know Hendrik Mobus, I was taking some photos at some concerts he organised here in CZ (Goatmoon, Der Stürmer, Dark Fury, Feuernacht, Permafrost, etc.), nothing I covered ever leaked to other people, I only share my photos via email and encrypted Megaupload storage. I can send you some samples if you wish.
