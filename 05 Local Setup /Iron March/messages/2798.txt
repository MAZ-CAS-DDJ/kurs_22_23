Stop trying to prove it - nobody cares, it's irrelevant, it changes nothing, you might as well be the descendant of a long line of cobblers for all anyone cares here.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Just revert my user title to something more dignifying.</p>
<p>I should remind you that you started this whole mess with your spastic comment way back in the "your heritage" thread (or whatever it was called).</p>
<p>Putting me 'in my place' does what? What does that accomplish?</p>
<p>Do you want more people on the IMF or not?</p>
<p>All I'm doing is offering a contemporary Revisionist version of orthodox Fascism, and I'm not taking the approach of users like FascistCapitalist and making an effort to belittle the perspectives of any and all opposition of my views in every post.</p>
<p>As a benign entity, I don't feel that I qualify this level of slander. It may not be much, but to be declared a Holop is insulting to my heritage. I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate the same behavior in return.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can just as easily suck it up and deal with it, it's just a title after-all. It wouldn't necessarily hinder the ethos of anything I say.</p>
<p>Of course, it's still amusing that the founder of the world's most efficient orthodox Fascist website declares himself to be a Stalinist, but so be it. It's your prerogative. </p>
<p>I will be persistent until my request is fulfilled. "Count Asshole" is a fine alternative, or "Baron Von Retard", if you insist. You know, add a touch of humor to it.</p>
