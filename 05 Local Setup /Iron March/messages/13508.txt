	Sieg heil!<br />
	If I am correct, you are a <abbr title="National Action"><abbr title="National Action"><abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr></abbr></abbr> member (sorry, I'm lurking IM <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span>occasionally</span></span>, so I'm not keeping up with nickname changes). I am member of polish organization Falanga, and I was asked by myÂ  superior to reach out to <abbr title="National Action"><abbr title="National Action"><abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr></abbr></abbr> member, to make an interview on our website Xportal (<a href="http://xportal.pl/" rel="external nofollow">http://xportal.pl/</a>). If you agree, we will send questions by e-mail or here if this is more convenient, and you (or someone else from <abbr title="National Action"><abbr title="National Action"><abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr></abbr></abbr>) will be able to answer in your/his time.<br /><br />
	If you want more details on our organization or Xportal before you agree I can answer all your questions.
