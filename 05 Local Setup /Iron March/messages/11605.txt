<p>You wanted to be part of the Asian hivemind? I understand that feel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I always wanted to be one or the other, not mixed. I had a phase where I thought I should embrace the Mestizo side, but that stopped when I realized how little I actually understood that culture. I don't even know Spanish.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maybe I just need to become a martyr and then Hitler will come down and spray paint my eyes blue or something.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I tell you, it's not easy just "accepting" both sides. It might be different if the Mestizo side was a based honorary Aryan Jap instead, but I'm caught in No Man's Land between trenches here. If I help the whites, who's to say that one day some /pol/ tier racial-anthropology-obsessed white nationalist guy just straight up murders me for sticking around?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If some accept me as a breddy cool guy, then there's inevitably also going to be those who don't want to put up with any mongrels. I'd feel like some Omega-cuck, like a dog searching for scraps from his master. And helping the Mexicans is out of the question, fuck them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The only real option is doing something on my own, I suppose. Maybe just moving to Alaska or some shit. Shit's fucked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I just want Europeans to live and be great, what a fucking hassle.</p>
