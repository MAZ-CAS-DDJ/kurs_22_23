<p>Literally "Within the view (as in aspect/perspective) of the inner", I looked on google and I've seen it translated as "from the inner point of view" on the internet, which looks like the perfect English phrase for it. This is some medieval Latin, I couldn't even find interioritas (interioritatis in genetive) in dictionary, the classical Latin word for it is interior, that's what got me confused a bit. The style of Latin changed through time and many words were altered or invented, especially in the so-called neo-Latin of early modern era (1400-1800) which was the basis for scientific and philosophical language of that age.</p>
