<p>I like to see things from every point of view and I couldn't handle the hugboxing and special snowflake syndrome of the Liberals, the commitment issues and lazy attitude of the Libertarians, or the general retardation and hypocrisy of the Republican party so I eventually made my way to National Socialism and after I got past all the whole "Nazi" bullshit and actually educated myself I realized that this is the best Ideology for me.</p>
