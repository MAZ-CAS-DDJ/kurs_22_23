	My siblings are indoctrinated to some degree. My brothers a communist. None are feminists some are race mixers. Most usually wont get up in arms and usually they havent given me trouble for my racial views, they are used to it as I have always been racial.

	The younger sisters I am talking of are 14, 6 and 4. So I just tell them minor racial things for now. My 16 year old brother hates blacks and doesnt do drugs. My ten year old brother hates gays. Not sure of his opinion on blacks.

	I only just saw your post in my intro thread. How old are the other women you know of?

	Tasmania is the best for farming plus 95% white. Heaps of biodiversity. Heaps of Anglo saxons, heaps of local markets and small farms.  Plus it is cooler. Rentals and food are cheaper. They have lots of small townships and blacks hate the cold.

	The Gov is definitely trying on purpose to wipe us out genetically.

	So proud of my daughter. We were fueling up today and she started hysterically laughing. Then she said "Mum! That man is wearing a girls shirt!" I look over and see a communist man wearing a pink tye dyed shirt.

	She knows that it's laughable for a man to be effeminate or communist. She also recently laughed her head of at a blonde white woman who told my daughter she doesn't have any children and considers her dogs to be children. My daughter told her how stupid she is.

	My daughter thinks ALL young women are mothers! She doesnt realize they are mostly feminists with no maternal instinct. It is truly amazing how everything is so clear to a FIVE year old! But not to stupid adults!!!
