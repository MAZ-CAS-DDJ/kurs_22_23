<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">Golden Dawn and Social Media</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">                Golden Dawn, founded in 1983, is a right-wing political party in Greece (Ellinas 6). Its policies include opposition to the 2010 Greek bailout and illegal immigration. It also promotes ethnic nationalism and national renewal to save the nation from national decadence (7). Although the party denies this, many have accused the party of being “neo-Nazi” (7)</span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'times new roman';"> (Sokol). </span></span><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">While it was on the fringes until 2010 (Ellinas 6-7), </span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">following the de-legitimization of the mainstream parties, the financial crisis, and mass immigration, Golden Dawn has gained considerable ground in recent elections (14). The Party gained 18 seats with 6.92% of the vote in the June 2012 elections, and polls reached 11-12 percent (2). Other sources claim that they have polled as high as 20% recently, making it the third most popular party in Greece, separated from the two leading parties only by a small margin (Bathrellos). While international news sources have reported extensively on Golden Dawn’s actions on the ground such as street patrols, Greek-only food handouts, and violence, they have yet to closely analyze Golden Dawn’s online presence. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">In this connected world it is necessary to look at the ways Golden Dawn uses social media and how important and effective it is for the party’s political ends. In examining the relationship between Golden Dawn and social media, one must recall the tradeoffs involved. Henry Jenkins writes in “Convergence Culture” that while new kinds of social media can be extremely useful, they can also be detrimental (Jenkins 466). Examples of both can be seen with regard to Golden Dawn. <strong>Social media is an inherently double-edged sword, and the way Golden Dawn selectively uses it demonstrates how social media can be used effectively while minimizing the negative consequences for political goals</strong>.</span></span><strong><span style="font-family:'times new roman';"> Domestically, social media is not very effective for the movement, as there seems to be no substitute for activism on the ground for gathering support among Greeks. However, there are certain venues in which social media has been very effective. The party’s website has been effective in providing counterpoint and their blogs aimed at expatriates as well as non-Greek foreigners have been effective in gathering support for the movement. </span></strong><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">I will demonstrate these points using articles on Golden Dawn, articles by elements of Golden Dawn, as well as an anonymous interview I conducted with a young activist.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">One way online media was effective for the movement was during the 2009 elections when a Golden Dawn member was elected as a councilmember for Athens. According to the activist I interviewed, many people would simply search for “Golden Dawn” online out of curiosity. This would lead them to the Golden Dawn’s main website, which proved to be quite useful during the campaigning, as it was the only alternative information source besides the mainstream media, which staunchly opposed Golden Dawn and always portrayed it negatively (Ellinas 17). Through the web, Golden Dawn was able to retort, and expose the lies and injustices of the establishment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">Social networking sites like Facebook were also used during campaigning to disseminate articles and to inform people about gatherings. However, these websites were also a double-edged sword and not very effective. Anarchists would make fake profiles and pass out false information and compromise people’s privacy, which made these websites of dubious value for the movement and in the end not very useful and virtually ineffective compared to physical action. This is similar to some of the ideas presented in Jenkins’ essay on convergence. He describes how old and new forms of media are “converging,” and what kinds of effects this has on people’s relationship with media. To demonstrate some of the “cons” of convergence, he describes an incident in which high school students use social media to create and disseminate compromising footage of their classmates (Jenkins 466). The way anarchists subvert social media against the movement is very similar to this. In both cases, the root cause of the problem lies in the fact that the information leaves one’s control when it enters websites like Facebook, allowing it to be easily used against the originator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">In contrast to the ineffectiveness of social networking sites, live activism was more effective domestically, and if anything it was “live activism” that propelled Golden Dawn into success in the more recent parliamentary elections. Activism on the ground must be contrasted with mostly passive and informative online activity, because this was the key to Golden Dawn’s success, not social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">Golden Dawn’s offline activities include “social work,” “cleansing actions,” as well as political activism. “Social work” includes security patrols for the elderly in urban areas, distribution of free food, medicine, and clothing to ethnic Greeks, as well as “Greek only” blood donation drives (Ellinas 17). They are also active in preserving Greece’s environment through donations and re-forestation projects (BEWS). Because of the crisis that Greece is going through, these actions have created support for Golden Dawn, especially since the Greek state has become increasingly unable to provide vital goods and services to citizens because of the financial crisis. These actions provide for direct material needs of common people, such as security and sustenance, which are affected by austerity. Therefore, any coverage of these actions, even in a negative light by the establishment, ends up being positive publicity for Golden Dawn. In this case, offline action and the traditional media reaction create positive publicity for Golden Dawn without the need for social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">The cleansing actions are attacks by members of Golden Dawn on illegal and legal immigrants, in an effort to protect citizens from immigrant crime (Ellinas 8). For example, Golden Dawn members, lead by two Members of Parliament (MPs) smashed up non-Greek merchants who were operating without permits in September (8). With the Greek state unable to deal with crime by illegal immigrants, police and citizens alike in some urban districts have turned to the Golden Dawn to sort things out (Smith). They also engage in televised violence. On June 7, Golden Dawn spokesman and MP Ilias Kasidiaris slapped female Communist MP Liana Kanelli in a televised debate, after Kanelli slapped Kasidiaris in the face (</span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">Kyriakidou)</span></span><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">. We might think that these violent actions, when transmitted through traditional media, will beget only condemnation and alienation of nonpartisans. However, it seems that this is not the case. As for the anti-immigrant violence, while many condemn these actions, they really do address a need for security among ordinary Greeks in neighborhoods with high levels of immigrant crime. An interesting outcome of the assault against Kanelli was that support for Golden Dawn went <em>up</em> immediately afterwards, according to Golden Dawn International. This attests to both the lack of trust in the Greek establishment parties (of which the Communist Party is a member), and the Greek public’s receptiveness to acts of violence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">Both types of actions are able to independently get the message across no matter what the media writes about them, because these actions speak for themselves. In this regard, activism on the ground far trumps social media in terms of effectiveness. Since they are grounded in real life events and non-malleable news venues, they are less easily subverted and more consistent in their effectiveness at spreading the message. These actions count more than social networking because the audience, comprised of Greek citizens, is immediately affected by food handouts and immigrant patrols.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">On the other hand, Greeks living abroad and potential sympathizers (such as European nationalists and American white nationalists) are not directly affected by Golden Dawn’s activities. For them, unsympathetic portrayal of Golden Dawn’s actions may not be enough to garner support because they do not live in Greece and do not necessarily know the context of these actions. To remedy this problem, Golden Dawn has extensively and effectively used social media directed at foreign and expatriate audiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman';"> Golden Dawn set up English-language content available on blogs made by various foreign branches in Montreal, Los Angeles, Attiki, Australia, Western USA and New York, as well as the Golden Dawn International Newsroom. The New York branch runs an English language blog as well as a podcast while the others run Greek language blogs probably for expatriates. The Golden Dawn International Newsroom also posts articles in English about the movement, and also has the manifesto translated into English as well. All the branch pages can be accessed from the links page of Golden Dawn New York, at xaameriki.wordpress.com (</span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">Neo-Nazi Golden Dawn Party Expands Presence In U.S)</span></span><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">. The Golden Dawn New York page claims that it wants to “counter the lies and propaganda against Golden Dawn” in the English speaking world (What Is Golden Dawn New York?). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">The activist I interviewed confirmed the effectiveness Golden Dawn’s English language websites, saying that the English language activism was a “really valuable activity,” through which people abroad could “learn the truth” and “what we have to say.” He also commented “foreign comrades could even get inspired in their own struggle.” Indeed, many individuals in the United States and in Europe have voiced their support online for Golden Dawn’s message, which western mainstream media reports unsympathetically. The mainstream English-language media presents Golden Dawn as “racist”, “neo-Nazi”, “xenophobic”, and “fascist”. The movement’s blogs are able to argue why Golden Dawn needs to be racialist, explain the extent of the immigration problem and how the Greek government undermines the interests of individual Greeks. By presenting this alternative view, social media here is able to challenge the establishment. This is a prime example of Johnson’s idea of new media being used to empower audiences at the “intersection of old and new media” he explained in his article “It’s All about Us”(Johnson 468). Johnson describes how the state of current technology, in which old forms of media (like television and newspapers) coexist with new media such as social networking sites and blogs, allows people to participate in a way which gives a voice to groups and individuals that experts and mainstream media ignore (468). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">However, the blogs are still not necessarily the kind of “participatory” culture that Jenkins talks about in which people freely create content as they see fit instead of being passive consumers (Jenkins 457). They are still top-down affairs, with bloggers answerable to the party leadership. This is because the movement must present a unitary face and not contradict itself or compromise its position by saying things that are detrimental to the party. Disciplined, centrally coordinated use of social media like this is quite similar to the way corporations use social media: if you look at any corporate Facebook page, you will see that it has been made with a clear purpose in mind, always self-consistent with content (such as photos, articles, and posts) carefully crafted by professional marketers. The way foreign audiences talks about Golden Dawn, however, is more in line with Jenkins’ user-created content idea and represents the kind of “convergence” Jenkins talks about. Foreign supporters and sympathizers on Facebook and on online forums “talk amongst themselves” based on content released by two centralized sources of information: Golden Dawn and the mainstream media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'times new roman';">In conclusion, we must remember that social media can be extremely efficient at getting one’s message across in certain situations. However, it is not a “cure-all” as some proponents of social media may have us believe, and it must be used with discretion. We live in a world in which traditional media, in the form of established outlets like television and online media co-exist and intermingle to create interesting results. Successful political movements, activism, and even business ventures in the 21<sup>st</sup> century must be able to evaluate the relationships between the two kinds of media and read into which form of media is more effective. This idea of using old and new media selectively is called “synergy” when it is applied to business, in which companies are able to “control all of those manifestations (of media)”(Jonson 468). Golden Dawn is now able to utilize both kinds of media in a manner similar to “synergy” to its advantage in order to carve out a substantial niche in the Greek political system. However, whether they will be able to survive in the long run is yet to be seen, and their ability to use both forms of media will play a key part in their future prospects.</span></p>
