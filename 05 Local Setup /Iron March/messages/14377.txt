			1. Our situation is really bad. Let's start with emmigration.About 800k Lithuanians left country from 1990 untill 2016 and are still leaving, so most active, pissed and provocative people left to search for a better life. Now we have about 2.9 million people, when we had 3.7 million.

	In Poland we also have a huge problem with emigration. Most people leave for countries like Great Britain or Germany. It is sad, especially when you hear young people saying that they do not want to have anything in common with their country and they want to leave as soon as possible.

			1.3 We are seeing rise in antifa/anarchists/communists groups. They are getting new members, recruiting, acting and doing a lot of degenerative stuff.

	In Poland antifa is practically nonexistent. They only exist on the internet. They may drop a banner here and there or organize a manifestation, but they do not posses a big threat, since they are weaklings.

			We have seen a rise in political movements, who are more or less pro-putin, which makes me worry, because to repeat the annexation of Krym in Lithuania is possible if Russia decides to do that. I wonder how NATO would act. Let's say some Russian troops move in and kill one of the NATO warriors from USA or UK, that might incite world war 3, but Lithuania would fall in couple of hours if Russia moves in, the same would happen to Latvia and Estonia. So we have to choose one of less evils, and I would choose NATO.

			1.5.1 The best scenario for NATO improvement, would be to kick out America, and that would leave us with NATO with only European nations, of course we have to settle conflict with Bosnia, Kosovo, Croatia, Serbia.

	I don't think America would let itself get kicked out of NATO, since basically it's their tool for expansion. The best solution would be to ressurect an Intermarium plan with the cooperation of national defence forces.

			About discrimination of polish minority. It's highly exageratted. Let's take an example: "If Lithuanians living in Poland asks for Lithuanian letters in Polish passports, would you agree?". It's more or less a political game for a couple of Polish Politics who are Populists to rise in power through these minorities. I was shauvinist against polish people 2 years ago, while I didin't knew anything about disastrous situation in Europe. But now, I don't feel any hate for those minorities. To summarize struggle of minority: if that minority respects laws and respects rules, there is no need for hate or any other atrocious actions. But if that minority wants some change in law and the majority of population is against it's hard to see how this can end peacefully or with a result there both sides would be happy.
