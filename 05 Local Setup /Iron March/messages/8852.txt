<p>Also I'm sorry if sometimes I take a while to reply, when I'm typing I often lose focus and start daydreaming about the things I'm talking about... Then forget I'm writing a message, get up, walk around, get a drink, etc. Idiots often called me a silly little boy. I started typing about how she loved kids too, except i really need to start thinking of OTHER examples ffs.</p>
