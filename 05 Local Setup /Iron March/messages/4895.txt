<p>Lol, tell me about it. With any luck someone would have lurked or found the time to kill thread through google and killed a few kikes and niggers and thought he was doing the baby Jesus' good work, lol. Or if he hasn't he'll remember it and do it without any hang ups. Religion's the only way you can get most people to do anything.</p>

<p>With these out of Africa theorists they jump to the wrong conclusions, just like evolutionists do. What the studies show is that African populations exhibit the most genetic diversity among all people groups. The theory is that once a population has been founded, the amount of genetic diversity increases over time. These studies also show, however, that those from the Middle East were the second most genetically diverse.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7181/full/nature06742.html" rel="external nofollow">The authors of one study admitted that Middle Eastern population genetics was not just simple gene flow, saying, "The Middle Eastern populations may have experienced both continuous gene flow and shared ancestry with the rest of Eurasia.</a></p>

<p>Looking at the evidence of admixture in Middle Eastern populations and the fact that those populations are still the second most genetically diverse, it is entirely possible that modern humans originated in the Middle East, but lost much of their genetic diversity through subsequent migrations and replacement. Back migrations can dilute the genetic diversity of a population, making them appear to be not as old as what they actually are. If you think about it, it is at the intersection of three continents. The Middle East has seen numerous people groups migrate through and back. So, it would be <i>very unlikely</i> that peoples of the Middle East would have the greatest genetic diversity of modern humans, <i>even if humans originated there</i>. From the middle east to North Africa and then then Asia and Central Europe, and eventually the Americas and Polynesia. where populations become gradually genetically differentiated from each other by means of geographical isolation, genetic drift, random mutation, and population bottleneck by means of inbreeding depression. The Kurgan hypothesis is the most likely to explain Indo-European origins.</p>

<p>Also a hint are Haplogroups J1 and J2. Don't be disillusioned by what you may have been told by Stormfronters. Both J1 and J2 are Caucasoid. J1 cannot be anything but Caucasoid when it is descended from Middle Eastern Y-DNA haplogroup IJ, the ancestral lineage from which haplogroup I is descended. I and J share too many of the same chromosomes/mutations. Not only are I and J descended from the same ancestral lineage in the same region, which means that I migrated to Europe from Western Asia, but I happens to have its highest frequencies in European populations. The two other subclades J2 and J* are also prevalent amongst Caucasoids. This clearly indicates that both J1 and J2 are both Caucasoid.</p>

<p>With the pashto account it was just a way of rubbing peoples faces in what's happening, what muslims really think of us and a valid criticism of passive, weakness in our country.</p>
