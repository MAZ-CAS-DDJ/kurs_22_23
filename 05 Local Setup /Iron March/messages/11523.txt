<p>If any of you guys think something is questionable you can just go ahead and message me about it, you'll end up getting a better handle on similar situations in the future, that simple. Best if you did it via skype so things could be coordinated real time but PMs are fine.</p>

<p>Like Zeiger talked to me about the Louis CK trell and he wanted to ban it outright, we don't ban just for trelling though and so long as it is not all over the forum, i.e. in serious threads, so long as its contained to appropriate places it's fine and people had fun with it so whatever.</p>

<p>Miscegenation Advocate on the other hand was obviously a banned user trying to come back and stirr up drama so I gassed him soon as it became obvious. So suspicious accounts are free game for immediate bans.</p>
