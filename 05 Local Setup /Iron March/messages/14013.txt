	NO. Ataka is a russophile party for old and sad communist grandmas.. true nationalists are ANTI Russia and pro Germany. Putin even pays them money...they are worst than the socialist party.

	look into boyan rassate even though you cant find anything on him in English or other languages.  This organization is the closest to a nationalist group as it gets for me: <a href="http://bgns.net/" rel="external nofollow">http://bgns.net/</a>

	Don't wanna sound like a bad bulgarian, but most bulgarians are whores to russia and are very bad patriots. Great bulgarians have also said it, we are just a very lazy nation...nothing to what it was centuries ago. That being said, most people sit on their ass and complain and dont do anything to improve the nation.
