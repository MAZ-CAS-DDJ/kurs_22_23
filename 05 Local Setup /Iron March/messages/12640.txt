<p>Your friend has my respect, the bite of the northern cold makes a man of a boy. Yes the reserves are always a mixture of race and religions, but once you get to the hardened soldiers, the fanatics, they are always Aryans. Rarely they are even at peak physical form, but they have the unshakable desire to serve, to conquer, to die. Yet citiznes see these people as disgusting and basically every ad hominem in the dictionary. They are a mixture of intellect, strength and loyalty, and we waste them on wars protecting savages or to create a war which will inevitably lead to another one.</p>

<p>Marines are full force no denying that, full respect. I am in the same situation as you, I am in college, as it was recommended by my father who is a high ranking officer in the CAF in order to become an officer, but the weak minded and pathetic people I meet on campus also make me want to go into the military right away, and give up on my Computer Programming diploma and eventually my Computer Engineering Degree, but I wish to be educated, I may just go back to a military college as I've been in the cadets and training for the military since I was old enough.</p>

<p>I am the only man in my family who is not in the military full-time, but based off of what my cousins have described about their assigned roles, I am very much so dedicated to becoming a sniper, after my eldest cousin described the feeling of hunting a savage, the personal reward you feel when you pull the trigger and put down a monster, I got chills down my back.</p>

<p>Canadian citizens are sheep, they run to the conservatives when the liberals tax us too much, and then the conservatives cater to the kikes and big businesses and then they run back to the liberals and say they are good people for fighting for the minorities and against big businesses. I believe we will go further right this time after Trudeau, but I do not know if we even can, he seems determined to destroy us. He wanted a 7 billion dollar deficit to spend on the people, 1.2 when to refugees and the number is now at 2.5, he sent 250 million to third world countries to combat global warming,  and a multitude of other things. Now we have a projected deficit of 20 billion dollars alone this year, not a single dollar has gone to Canadians. Now they want to bring 300,000 new immigrants, when companies are slashing jobs and our resources industry which basically makes our economy is falling a part and workers are committing suicide. One of my dad's friend who is pretty high ranking said " Soon the true patriots shall eat the weaker ones alive." I know for a fact all Canadian soldiers will be on the side of a new Furher.</p>
