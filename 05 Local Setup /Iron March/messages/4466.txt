<p>Remember how I was talking about alternative views to evolution? One I spoke of in particular was devolution. I've got a bit of time to elaborate so here goes.</p>

<p>A good case against evolution is proposed by G.K. Chesterton in <em>The Everlasting Man</em>. I'm sure you've probably heard of G.K. Chesterton, so no introduction is necessary there. He argues that primitive men are not primordial men, but rather degraded men who got to where they are from an initially high state of civilization originating in the Near East. I think there's a lot of validity to this theory, because the physical emergence of the negro dates from the Neolithic period, around 6000 BC to be exact. The fact that Northeast Africans are more Caucasian than negro is powerful testimony to the great antiquity of the Caucasian type in east Africa (I'm sure you've seen the countless studies aswell that show Somalis and Ethiopians as clustering as intermediates between Negroids and Caucasoids). Their negroid admixture dates from the Bantu expansions of 3500 BC. The negro is a recent product and therefore but a child in the ways of human civilization. It should now be obvious why the negro has accomplished nothing at all in the previous 8000 (?) years of his existence.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/39187/Asselar-man" rel="external nofollow">The earliest definite Negroid skeleton is Asselar Man dated to 6500 B.P. and discovered in Mali.</a> The Caucasoid race is the oldest race of man and first variety of humankind. According to the great anthropologist Carleton S. Coon in The Races of Europe:</p>
<p><strong>The earliest Homo sapiens known, as represented by several examples from Europe and Africa, was an ancestral long-headed white man of short stature and moderately great brain size.</strong></p>
<p>The earliest skeletal fragments of modern homo sapiens found to date are those of Caucasoids (31,000 BP, Czech Republic).</p>
<p>Both Old Earth Christians and Young Earth creationists believe that man was specially created, with slight disagreement (of very little practical importance) on the timing of Adam’s special creation.  As you know from my previous posts, Old Earthers interpret the Biblical lineage less literally and believe Adam was created about 50,000 years ago, whereas Young Earthers think Adam was created no more than about 10,000 years ago.  These views are practically identical philosophically in regards to the origin of man as compared to other models.</p>
<p>Biblical characters coming relatively soon after the flood, such as Esau and David, are described as having red hair. This is interesting because red hair is uniquely recessive: it would not spontaneously develop among dark-skinned, black-haired people.  This provides yet another Biblical confirmation that dark skin is the adaptation, rather than light skin in cold climates, as proposed by OOA theorists such as Rushton. Red-haired people produce very little melanin, are almost comparable to albinos in their skin tone, and there would have been no reason for Middle Eastern peoples like the ancient Israelites to spontaneously produce this trait as an adaptation. The very word “Adam” means ruddy, or red, which would seem an odd name unless it were descriptive. The word "man" in Hebrew is aw-dawm' which means ruddy and comes from the root word aw-dam' which means to blush or to show blood in the face of which the Caucasians are the race which blushes. It seems to me that Adam and Eve were more likely to be redheads than anything else, given the extremely low levels of radiation pre-fall.</p>
<p>Contrary to mainstream misunderstanding of science and popular new atheist Darwinistic school doctrines, I'd learnt that most mutations are harmful, I also learnt a lot of stuff about inbreeding as well as so-called Hybrid Vigor, namely it isn't what most people make it out to be or think it is (and I've made posts about this before on the site which I'll be able to link once the site's working properly again). Mutations are associated with radiation exposure and the earth received less radiation in the period before the fall and flood than after. I think this is relatively significant to explaining the decline in man. Extra melanin produced by darker skin is an adaptation to UV radiation. After Babel, people were scattered, some were scattered away from the equator, and some were scattered closer to the equator. Microevolutionary adaptations take time. Those who migrated closer to the equator would have endured many generations of genetic damage from radiation before the adaptation could have reached steady-state, balancing their vitamin D needs with the increased radiation load. Much of man’s original genetic inheritance was lost, particularly those most complex structures relating to longevity and intelligence.</p>
<p>Radiation has harmful effects in general, and its ability to cause mutations in particular the change in skin tone brought by UV radiation would correlate with the degradation of other genetically-based characteristics. It is highly likely that the pre-flood humans were significantly more intelligent than humans today and also more genetically apt, which would explain their extreme longevity where they were able to live for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Here <a href="http://isteve.blogspot.com/2012/07/things-fall-apart-greg-cochrans-new.html" rel="external nofollow">Steve Sailer reports the latest theory of “devolution” by the renowned genetic scientist Gregory Cochran</a>.  A key quote:</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="1670" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Greg Cochran has been introducing a a fairly new and potentially important theory of the genetic origins of race differences in IQ.  It’s less a theory of evolution than of devolution. The mechanism causing effective differences, he argues, is less selection for higher IQ due to differences in the environment (e.g., winter versus tropics selecting for forethought); instead, a large driver is differential rates in random mutation leading to differences in average level of deleterious genetic load, which tend to correlate with climate warmth.</div></blockquote>
<p>This seems to support Richard Lynn's theories in <em>Race differences in intelligence</em>.</p>
<p>Richard Lynn's Dysgenics is also an important read that can fit well to this theory of devolution, it is just put into more degenerated (materialistic) terms. Sailer, Lynn and Cochran are evolutionists, so it's a given that they would interpret the data through that scope, but their data remains valuable.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, I don't know for sure, it's mere speculation. It's certainly more likely to be an OOA theory or the one I proposed. The multi-regional hypothesis is highly unlikely, because there is no evidence of a Neanderthal/Homo erectus Y-DNA or even mtDNA contribution to the modern human gene pool and humans so similar biologically (on an absolute basis - genetic distance is still important and races and significant differences still exist) as blacks and whites, in all probability, would not have emerged spontaneously from independent processes, and it is furthermore unlikely that the same “miracle” of evolution towards higher forms would occur twice.</p>
<p>That's my take anyway. I probably haven't explained it that well, but you should get the drift.</p>
