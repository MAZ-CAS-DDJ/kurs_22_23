<p>That clip was hilarious, same as the other one where he rants about being twice as likely to be robbed by a black; once again you've hit the nail on the head. I know a bloke from Serbia in his mid 20s, bit of an ugly wife and he's a bit of a pretty boy but he's pretty funny he talks about the civil wars a lot and there's a veneer of pride about having endured it. I've always been interested about the history in that part of the world and that time period, but I admittedly don't know as much as I'd like to about it.</p>
<p>Funny you speak about housing too. Peoples gardens here seemed to be a lot more open, have more space and be a lot greener rather than gravel or paved over with walls and metal bars put up they still looked neat enough but it didn't look like some over-protected agrophobics house like most do now - even on council estates. Consumerism really turned people into pussies who try to keep up with the joneses and it doesn't seem to have gotten any better since recession and inflation's happened - people are fucking stupid, it's like they think "it's all going to shit, something will give soon anyway, can't carry on like this but we'll buy shit anyway". Kikes are very observant (the talmud should be a testament in itself to how critical and analystic [autistic] they are), they don't miss this or hesitate to take advantage of it. I've always said they're the smarter version of the gypsies and the weaker version of Nigerians (I'm knowledgeable on the organised crime in Nigeria, their advanced fee frauds are also some of the easiest scams to pull off, they're very flexible and can border on being a genius when white people pull them off). Their false identification and production of it happens to be very good too, with help from their government officials whom are easily paid off. Easy as fuck to get a fully working Nigerian passport with false details.</p>
<p>back onto the subject of films, Gangster NO.1 is a very good film.</p>
