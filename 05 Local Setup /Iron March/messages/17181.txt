	Also discord servers are free. Slack is safe as well but no voip text only. Skype makes me paranoid lol, I'v seen people get doxxed and DDOS'd from simply being in skype groups with wrong people. Granted this was years ago when i played a lot of online games may not be the case anymore. You guys are obviously trusted so i'm not worried about it from my end ill hop on w/e just throwing that out
