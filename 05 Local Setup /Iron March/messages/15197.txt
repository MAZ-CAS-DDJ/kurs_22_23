	Hey Xav, I was wondering what you think of Reactionaries? I am just asking because I recently put that on my ideology section of my IM profile and I was just wondering what you thought of Reaction-ism and Reactionaries in general? Or do you think I will take some flack for embracing Reactionary ideology as well as Fascism?
