	Nor to other members of IM I hope, I really am trusting you with my credibility. But my main point from the beginning of all of this is wondering if IM will take any steps to prevent Islam from ever tainting this board and the members of it? It clearly doesn't fucking end well, and if Devon never became muslim this never would have happened. Was Devon converted here, or elsewhere?
