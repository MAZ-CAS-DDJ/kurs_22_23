	When'd you insult me? Not that it matters either way but I don't recall that happening.

	Yeah we keep hearing that kind of shit all the time because of that one guy in AW. In fact when he had turned Muslim there was a <strong>big</strong> halabaloo on IM because of itÂ and we ended up permabanning that individual from the forum, he's still in AW but that's already an AW matter, not an IM matter - we don't actually run the movements that get formed here and encourage them to act as autonomous movements of their own with full sovereignty over their actions, we just help promote their activities and offer help/advice but as an outside entity. If this bites AW in the ass somehow then its entirely on them.

	And we've had multiple and repeated threads and posts which showcase the established IM consensus on Islam: gtfo Europe and other white countries, and its fundamentally a heresy and not a legitimate spiritual tradition, with the possible exception of Sufism, but fuck it, we hadn't researched it properly yet to make a definitive case for that statement, and even if it is legitimate it still needs to GTFO Europe etc.

	My book-sized article ZERO TOLERANCE featured this same message as well:

			However one thing is certain, that Europeans must never accept the wholesale adoption of clear cut foreign spiritual teachings such as Islam (the very legitimacy of which we question as per point one, with some due consideration given to Sufism, which, however does not exclude it from what has been said so far in this point) or Buddhism (which is legitimate, but nevertheless foreign).

	Basically its the same story as always, people who criticize us on some points never actually read any IM materials, like how some keep confusing IM for a movement when our Mission Statement makes it clear that we are <strong>not</strong> a movement. Our reaction to that is largely meh, whatever. Those who will <em><strong>want</strong></em> to know what's really going on will always find out the real story.
