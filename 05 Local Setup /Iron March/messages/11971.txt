<p>Alright cool. I look forward to you letting me know about your progress. So, I guess if you know the ending then you know that it is implied that the Empire will eventually change into a parliamentary democracy. At least we don't get to see that. Also, your right reforming the nobility would have been the way to go. Out of curiosity which episode are you on exactly? I don't want to talk too far ahead and spoil stuff for you. Also, great! I'm add you as a friend right away. Until next time.</p>
