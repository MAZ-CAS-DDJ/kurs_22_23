<p>Because it broke with Orthodox Marxism and revised it in a way that eventually formed a philisophical foundation for corporatism/fascism.</p>
<p>Communism is a scientific theory that explains history by how social forces in the form of different classes are motivated only by materialist interests to compete with each other. It does ignore any moral or ethical approach, but simply provides (pseudo-)scientific facts to explain life, "one is simply a result of the other" - so its determinist rather then moral.</p>
<p>The syndicalists broke with this tradition because they thought socialism was a ethical or moral consideration (so not inspired by materialism, but a psychological or ethical approach). They did not believe it was sheer materialism that moved the masses (as Marx suggested) but the social myths that inspired them - a theory provided by Sorel. Its an entirely different aproach on socialism, which formed the cornerstone for pre-fascism in the form of syndicalism.</p>
<p>Sorel thought that human actions came forth from irrational faith and rational methods. Believe in something (like a general strike for instance) can be effective even before it (the strike) really happens. This means myth is in politics was just as effective as reality - if the masses are convinced of their own victory, eventually the system will be overtrown by them. It was the driving force after each great revolution; Christianity, reformation and the French revolution.</p>
<p>He also understood the post-Marxist developments of capitalism (industrial revolution). He saw that capitalism led to developments in which the proletariat (working class) would transform in a bourgeois middle class, which proves Marx his theory wrong. But Sorel recognized that to fight capitalism and to bring forth a subversive revolution the myth of the proletariat must be preserved and even made stronger because it was the mean with which the masses would become revolutionary.</p>
<p>Syndicalism was a product of the crisis of socialism. The crisis of socialism was the fact that Marx his predictions did not come out, instead of the proletariat becoming a revolutionary force because of worsening conditions, they where transformed into a bourgeois middle class under the influence of social-democracy providing better living conditions. Instead of a proletarian revolution for communism, the proletariat (in fact all classes) massively joined the army during WO I to fight for their country in name of the nation rather then for their class. So none of Marx his prophecies came out, he just provided a myth for the masses to fight for (class war). Therefore the myth of the great war - namely nationalism and the nation - was adopted by parts of the syndicalist movement, thereby replacing "class war" with national unity and class harmony (which is in fact the basis of corporatism).  </p>
<p>Syndicalism its aversion against social-democracy also led to a strong anti-parlementarian and anti-democratic tendency and a glorification of violence and heroism which was later on adopted by the early fascists. Syndicalism promoted a permanent revolution and a continiued renewal of the (proletarian) revolutionary consciousness. It opposed all forms of pacifism because that represented reactionary conservatism - a counter-revolutionary standstill used by the status quo to maintain her existance. War in that sense represented the constant renewal of life and society because it destroyed all which was once self-evident. It was a expression of the vision of history as a cyclic process that repeats itself over and over like an old tree strunk from which a new outgrowth grows.    </p>
<p>So to make this long story short: syndicalism deprived socialism from its democratic optimism and materialist determinism, thereby providing the missing link between the transformation of Socialism into Fascism (or corporatism so you will).</p>
