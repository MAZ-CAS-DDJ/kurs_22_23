<p>By russian owner you mean Slavros, right? Yeah, he definitely knows his shit. I always enjoy his posts. His Stalin obsession kinda bothers me though. He's a russian nationalist, and Stalin obviously had a huge influence on Russia. But still, kinda weird seeing a fascist idolizing one of the biggest anti-fascists to ever live.</p>

<p>Yeah, that would be great. Would be nice getting to know some people on here. I'll make a Skype account this week. I'll message you when i've made it.</p>
