	Don't you worry about the future with us mate. We're starting some good stuff in Melb and you'll hear about us very soon. In the near future we'll be sending out flyers all over the country for free for people to sticker up. Probably by the end of the year. Give us a yell and I'll set you up. Also, if you know anyone that's great with graphic design send them our way. What we need most is a good artist to make up propaganda designs of <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> quality.
