	Are images such as these still up for free use by members?   Ive met someone in my area (on here)  and thought id broach the idea of running a chapter or something.  If one was to work in a new QR code (assuming that one is invalid),  that would be perfect for postering in nearby areas.  Stick them on the Antifa stickers that plague the streets
