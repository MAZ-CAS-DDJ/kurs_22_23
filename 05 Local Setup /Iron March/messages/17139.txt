	As far as skills not bad with computers and networks from a software end but by no means a hacker or anything just computer literate. Good work ethic and fast learner. Little bit of plumbing, electric and wood working thanks to growing up in a family of men who are "Do it yourself" oriented, also am able to build and grow fruits and vegetables good on a small scale (large backyard). As far as hobbies i read, hike, ride quads, raised around firearms and am a pretty damn good shot with AR platform, AK Platform and generally all guns i'd fair to say. While i do watch the occasional film or play a game a few hours a week to relax i'm by all means an outdoors man first. Big soccer fan played for years. Have access to a woodworking shop and CNC and Mill and am working on learning how to run those well.
