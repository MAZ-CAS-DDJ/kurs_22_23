	Hey Mate. <br />
	The Group is a revival of an old youth wing of the Australia First Party. Though Aus First have endorsed us they mostly let us act autonomously. We definitely are not Kosher. The goals of the group are to spread the ideology of White Nationalism for Australia, and we want to create a more intelligent group of White Nationalists, as opposed to the Skinhead stereotype. Right now the group is acting as a sort of fraternity for White youths who are racialist to meet each other. We hope to be able to create a real political presence on the streets through rallies and similar activities, but for now we are still working on the process of gathering enough members to safely do so. The group serves as primarily White Nationalist, and we welcome anyone who supports the idea of a White Australia, regardless of personal beliefs, be they economic,religious, ect.
