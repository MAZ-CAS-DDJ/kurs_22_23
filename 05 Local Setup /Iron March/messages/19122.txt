	Hey mate! I've returned and the overall situations looks like that:
</p>

<p>
	My guy at this point is not willing to leave his projects in Ukraine. The other guys were also reluctant to go anywhere, plus a lot of them are russian and have legal reasons as well. So at this point, no good news.

	Your enquiry made me wonder on few things, however. I am not in the army, have no military and weapon experience. I will graduate university soon but obviously that won't help me much when shit hits the fan. For now, I lift as often as possible (2-4 times a week), do occasionaly a cardio. Physically wise, things are okay - can always be better but just want to pass my exams since I am almost at the end. Also, i don't own any specific gear at all that would help me survive. Can you recommend me stuff like that - I have some cash saved so I better spend it on something productive - sleeping bags, shoes, etc. Mind recommending additions ? I also feel like going to shooting range to learn how to shoot and stuff. Thanks in advance.
