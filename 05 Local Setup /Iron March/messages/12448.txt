<p>Ha ha, you got that right. No my family won't tolerate any religion that is not Christianity or (unfortunately) Judaism by extension. Since Christianity technically grew out of Judaism, and even more unfortunately my dad is a big fan of Israel as a US ally. So my father and I don't talk politics or religion at all. He would burn my copy of Mein Kampf if he knew that I owned it or even had one in my possession. My parents are divorced and I live with my mom while I am attending school so lucky I can hide stuff like that form my dad. In answer to your question I am a junior in Uni and hope to go to graduate school someday, but that will be a while. But yeah I wish there was an NA like organization here in America, if there was I would join without a second thought. Instead, I recently began weightlifting as a way to get into shape. However, I started out my life as your typical beta white geek so it is going to take a while to build up to were I want to be, but fortunately I'm young and healthy so if I stick with it I should be were I want to be in a couple years. So anyways, what sort of Paganism are you into, Norse?      </p>
