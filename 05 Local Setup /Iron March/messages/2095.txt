<p>Pretty fine. Summer time ended, which sort of sucks but not too mad about it. After my birthday I had a week long binge and in the end I started to bleed inside and decided it's time to call quits on the sauce. Had a pretty wild and nice summer. Ended up sleeping at one smack addict ex-cons place who was actually a really lovely guy, chilled on speed in a stolen car with gypsies (of course) and climbed on old warehouses and stores with bro, did some adventuring. Pretty cool.</p>
<p>You?</p>
