<p>Made a post in the morality thread explaining fatalism vs. nihilism and how one can reject moral objectivity while maintaining a personal morality. Not sure if it answers the questions you or anyone had but I hope it helps. I apologize for any typos or formatting issues, typed it up on my phone. Should you need anything else, feel free to message me, I don't really post here any longer as I feel I've outgrown what this place has to offer but I'm happy to make some posts if people want my opinion on something or would like some kind of assistance in dealing with others.</p>
<p>By the way, nice avatar.</p>
