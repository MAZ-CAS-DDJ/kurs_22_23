<p>Hey, linkingdeath, quick question for you.</p>
<p>I'm interested in acquiring some Golden Dawn jackets - I've tried to find an official store but I can't understand Greek, though I found a merchandise selling blog. Unfortunately the jackets were just presented in images, and I didn't see any links as to where I might purchase them. I was wondering if you could help, seeing as how you're in GD.</p>
<p>Much appreciated if you can help me out,</p>
<p>Talleyrand</p>
