<p>I agree completely. The blacks I mainly get on with are black women, unsurprisingly lol.</p>

As far as I know my contacts had all intentions of carrying on their influence in UKIP on a regional basis although they've no idea where I am at the moment, just that I'm gone. The more preposterous exposure UKIP gets the less negative effects it will have. Many supporters and voters laugh it off or play along with it.</p>

The racists here in Venezuela are coming out of the woodwork into National Socialism more and more, mestizos, mulattoes, tri-racials and whites alike - they're very meritocratic and big on selective breeding. It's amazing what the death of chavez and being left with a shittier situation can do to a people. Even anti-Chavez people gleefully quote his more "anti-semitic" talking points. I expect to see some good things come out of Peru, Argentina and Venezuela over time. The atmosphere is greater here although like you said with the non-western women earlier as is with life it's not perfect. You get up early here, do some skinning, farming or whatever you do, have an hour and a half off in the afternoon, go back to work until 4 or 5 and depending on how well you did you can take the next day off to chill or do whatever you wish. The outdoor life is brilliant here, tons of waterfalls, national parks, mountains, jungles, breath taking scenes. Easy going besides the traffic.</p>

I'll probably reply back to any mail in a couple of days, need to catch up on some sleep and other stuff.</p>
