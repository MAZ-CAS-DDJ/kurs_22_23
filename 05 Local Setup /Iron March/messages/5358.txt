<p>Very true, the utopianism is definitely another big one. It's hard to sell something if</p>
<p>it seems too based on hope rather than actual practical possibility. Though, this wasn't a problem for the Obama</p>
<p>campaign, but then again American liberals tend to be pretty dumb. </p>

<p>Communism and Anarchism today certainly do attract a lot of morons and weirdos (ex. Anarcho-queer).</p>
<p>From university profs all the way to 14 year olds on reddit/revleft.</p>

<p>I used to not mind Jews that much, but seeing how big of an influence they've had in the West</p>
<p>I just can't ignore them. All the social justice movements, banks, and even in the media, vastly owned by Jews.</p>
<p>Why would such a small minority need so much power? Something is definitely a little off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The one thing I've noticed about the left is that they don't live in reality. They never think realistically </p>
<p>about anything - history, race, etc. - none of it. They constantly look through the lens of their ideology</p>
<p>of equality and all that jazz, instead of just examining things logically. In my opinion,</p>
<p>modern leftism is simply just an undiagnosed mental illness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, good article. I'll definitely have to read more on that stuff (especially NatSoc).</p>
