<p>I agree with it.</p>
<p><strong>"The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."- Romans 6:23</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-size:12px;">"Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." - Genesis 3:19</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>In the bible God speaks through Moses, and says, "For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell [sheol]." (Deut. 32:22) This is a symbolic phrase, descriptive of the punishment that was to come upon the nation of Israel, denoting the utter ruin of the nation, when, as Paul expresses it in the New Testament, "wrath to the uttermost" would come upon the nation.</p>
<p>Leeser, a noted translator of the Old Testament, translates the expression the "lowest deep," and the British revisors made it read "lowest pit."</p>
<p>Here's another telling passage. "The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave [sheol], and bringeth up." (1 Sam. 2:6) One point in this statement precluded the possibility of using the word hell, with its distorted meaning, to translate sheol; namely, that the Lord will bring up from sheol those who go there. This of course would completely upset the traditional theology concerning hell which insists that it is a place from which there can be no return, and where the victims suffer forever, namely a doctrine which originated with the catholic church to scare its believers.</p>
<p>The English word "hell" is in the Old Testament Scriptures thirty-one times. It is of Old English usage but like many other English words it's taken on a radical change of meaning. Originally it simply meant to conceal, to hide, to cover; hence it was properly descriptive of any concealed, hidden, or covered place. In Old English literature may be found references to the helling of potatoes, which means putting them into pits and the helling of a house, meaning to cover it with a thatched roof.</p>
<p>The word hell was therefore properly used by the translators as synonymous with the words "grave" and "pit" to translate the Hebrew word sheol.</p>
