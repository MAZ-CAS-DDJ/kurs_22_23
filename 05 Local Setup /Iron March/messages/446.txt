<p>Strasser's most in depth vision of what a National Socialist system would look like was in "Germany Tomorrow". </p>
<p>Here he propounds the need for the redistribution of property and the "de-proletarianization" of all Germans. Strasser goes into detail and says that the class of property owners are transformed into managers accountable to both the state and the workers themselves. The manager owns the majority of the stock in the company; so he makes more by managing and performing the work that capitalist actually do; however the workers too own a share of their company and engage in profit sharing so that the system of wages is anulled. Strasser also claims this system will give working Germans a say in management of said enterprise. Public trading of stocks is forbidden and market competition is over ridden by degrees of economic planning from the state (such as investments and being a last resort employer for members of the folk who work in no enterprise; thus ensuring full employment). </p>
<p>Strasser's main objection to capitalism was that the class of industrialists (capitalists) were able to exercise so much influence while leaving the little guys out of it. It was un-folkish to him. Likewise this was also his reason for rejecting Marxism, "a socialism alien to the Germany". He saw the Marxist theory of "dictatorship of the Proletariat" as replacing one class dictatorship with another, which it essentially is. He envisioned a future of Germans working cooperatively and working together as one single entity rather than worrying just about class interest. </p>
<p>If you have any questions in particular; you can feel free to ask me. I will also send you the links to the two most important works by Strasser in which his ideology is laid out:</p>
