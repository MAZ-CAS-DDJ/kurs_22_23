<p>By the way, what's your stance on the Romanians from Valea Timocului(Tribalia), if you don't mind me asking? While the Romanians from the Serbian Banat are treated fine by the Serbs, the ones from Valea Timocului are being discriminated and brainwashed by the State(identifying as Vlachs instead of Romanians - which, amusingly enough, is a medieval exonym for Romanian.)</p>
