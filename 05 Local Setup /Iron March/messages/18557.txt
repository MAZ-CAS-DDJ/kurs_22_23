	Anyway, this is a great discussion. It's hard to place oneself to an ideology when you don't know the exact details and the outcomes of the ideology in reality. Sometimes i'm just only interested in space-technology to evolve, so we can experience other worlds and learn. I'm very interested in sciences, but also in the immaterial. The two working parallel towards truth. Like for example the planned city Germania.
