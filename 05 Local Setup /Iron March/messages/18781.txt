	We're harsh for a reason. If people are turned off because of it then they're a waste of time and we don't want them, if they stick around, then obviously they're willing to learn and are worth a damn. You've stuck around so obviously that answers that. Honestly the closest thing to this irl is joining a sports team, the new guy always gets berated until he eventually finds his spot in the team. <br /><br />
	Good to hear others are pm'ing you, are Cannon and Blood and Adventure some of them?
