<p>Yeah tbh when I genuinely want to learn something I just research it on my own and read direct sources, college in america is a joke. we have recluses but mostly in wooded areas, they avoid where I am at least. Yeah its unpopular histry that aryans once had alot more territory than tkday, unfortunately.  And not sure, need to get my life straightened out first, US is a little weird with the race war business. Our right wing loves israel and kisses their ass all the time, that Glen beck guy said that America was established to create israel as our divine purpose. Leftwing dislikes israel but only because they kill poor brown people, plus they want to establish white slavery. Our side will have a tough time here, lots of work to be done. </p>
<p>It's nothing too bad. I've heard of chaos magic but never really looked into it in depth. Hazel eyes can be very pretty. I guess so lol, I guess I do them as side hobbies. I don't take it too seriously but some guy offered me money for a drawing today so eh lol. No direct fascists, just some people that "casually browse" /pol/ or something. In southern cali it's pretty hard to find anyone far right. Ah okay, never been to chiacgo, I've been all across the west coast including Canada and alaska but haven't seen much of the rest of America. I have some family in texas, the south and new York and thats basically it. Always wanted to see Germany or europe in general. </p>
<p>My bad for being so curious, I like meeting European fascists! And pagan fascist doesn't hurt either</p>
