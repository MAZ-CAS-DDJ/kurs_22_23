	Hey Bro, I bought those masks (10) but I didn't realise the post would take so long. They should arrive in January. The email address I was using previously is now kaput (for obvious reasons) so if you could mail me an address again to caledonianstorm@tutanota.com that would be swell. It's looking almost definite I'll be visiting in either March, April or May for at least a week, so hopefully we can meet up for some cheeki breeki zepelini and kvass.
