	Greetings!
</p>

<p>
	It is the 1st of October, so today I will ask you some questions:
</p>

<p>
	1. What is the main teaching of the movie <em>Abre los Ojos</em>? There is one thing you can be sure about in this life, what is that?
</p>

<p>
	2. What do you think about the three factions in <em>Thief</em>, namely the Pagans, the Hammerites, and the Keepers? Which one would you join?
</p>

<p>
	3. What is your overall opinion on the book <em>El Dador</em>?
</p>

<p>
	The whole day is yours, so you don't have to rush. Take your time to think about the questions and your answers and write a letter at night.
</p>
