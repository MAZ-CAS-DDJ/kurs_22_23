	Hey there.
</p>

<p>
	It's still going to take me a while to make progress on this, but here's the first paragraph of the preface to give you a taste:
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:14.2pt;">
	<span lang="en-us" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;" xml:lang="en-us">In the way it was adapted by fascist ideology, racial thought should neither be understood as a specialized science neighboring the fields of general anthropology or ethnology, nor as a chapter of social hygiene which had to be emphasized for several, even expedient reasons in Italy. Fascist racial thought has instead to be understood in its precise political meaning, and in its role as a new general philosophy and spiritual attitude towards life. Is this attitude consistently adopted, it has to establish itself in several distinct fields in which many people had, until yesterday – or rather, in the time of rationalist and positivist thought that had been dominant until yesterday – no relations to these kinds of issues, nor had they been allowed to have them. Fascist racial thought certainly has it purely biological and anthropological aspects; but especially in the way in which we have to phrase the question of race in Italy, these aspects gain their proper value only when integrated into a more general concept and doctrine. With the fascist racial ideology – just like with the national socialist – a certain worldview is replaced by another, from which particular and precise methodological principles arise to govern a whole string of different fields. In its higher form, fascist racial ideology takes indeed the shape of a revolutionary idea. To it can be applied the value of a “mythos”, a center of crystallization for the creative forces and developments of an era.</span></p>

	It's not an easy text to translate and I'm rather busy with other shit, so it's going slow, and I have to re-read each paragraph a couple of times to capture the proper meaning. I'll <em>try</em> to get the thing finished in 2017 though.
</p>

	Gib feedback to this first mostly-finalized paragraph pls. I'm trying to be as literal as possible but sometimes I just have to change the sentence structure a bit so it doesn't sound awkward in English.
