<p>Ah, no worries. I think my uncle shares most of them, my godfather, and my fianc√©e is all I can think of. No worries about the late reply, real life comes first.</p>
<p>I've definitely had better days. My father just died. It was 3 years coming but still a shock. I'm enraged at my family. My mother wanted to divorce him, ended up leaving him, brainwashed all the other children against him. I saw her the past few days, not planning on doing that again for a while. The one comfort was that his death wasn't painful, and that he was still receiving the eucharist. Nothing was such a relief as when I'd heard that. He never told me while he was alive but he couldn't really speak so that's not a surprise. </p>
<p>Sorry for the wall of text. We do have local sspx and I've found a few similar to me when I can get down there. I need to stay after more, there are actually tons of young people. </p>

<p>That should help you check your area. Have you ever seen a Latin Mass? It's beautiful. Just a heads up, there's usually a dress code which includes covering your head and no pants on the women. Just at mass you don't have to follow in public life. Long skirts, shoulders covered, closed shoes, it might actually be on the website. Just don't want you to travel all the way out somewhere and not be let in!</p>
