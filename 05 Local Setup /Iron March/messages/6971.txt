<p>This is where I differ from the majority opinion here, I do not believe that homosexuality is inherently wrong, it's the supposed fabricated culture around it all that is wrong. The culture is what should be attacked, not the people. Large portions of the Nazi Party leadership were in fact homosexual. I don't think letting gays marry would undo the fabric of the nation (if it does, then the fabric wasn't good anyways). On abortion I think until the baby is able to live on its own outside the mother's body it should ultimately up to the mother, that said, I do not think abortion is the proper way to handle a child you are physically or financially unable to raise, but I do not favour it being outlawed. As a nation we shouldn't encourage abortion, but we shouldn't put any unnecessary barriers in front of a woman wanting to abort her baby. It'd be best for the child not to be born under circumstances where it would be improperly raised, and in order to prevent the further corruption of the youth, we should allow the mothers to decide whether or not they're ready to have a baby and raise it until it's 18.</p>
