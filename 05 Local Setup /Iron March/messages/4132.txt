<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I was going to reply to your Shinto conversion thread, Steel, firstly to add my two cents on the matter, which would largley have been a Nietzsche plug (regarding <em>Thus Spake Zarathustra</em> which I consider to be a fundamentally <em>religious</em> text) and to query your seeming compulsion for a formalised religious practice - as a matter of curiosity. And then, after the vitriol you recieved and your lament that the thread had devolved to shit and the only real critique was that Shinto wasn't 'western' I was going to reply to that and concur.</p>
<p>I'll check out that forum out before long, cheers.</p>
