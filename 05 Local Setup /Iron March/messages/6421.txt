<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">As for making headway in Britain, I think the best bet might be to bluntly point out what we’re currently talking about: that the British ‘Right’s’ empiricism is inherently wrapped up with the liberal tradition. An astute enough analysis – forcefully argued – and we could start to make headway amongst the more intellectually-minded rightists. Hopefully it’d spread from there, and open up more of them to the possibility and necessity of abstract thinking.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">I think I see what you mean re: de Benoist/Faye – two sides of the same coin. The one flourishes where the other fails, and vice-versa. De Benoist’s work has no non-rational pull; whereas Faye’s stuff is almost all non-rational pull. The trouble is they’re not really arguing for the same worldview. Two different but related worldviews. And then these worldviews – in whichever variation – need greater representation at lower and lower levels. That’s ultimately what I believe needs to come into existence: a European-wide counter-culture or movement. Our worldviews need to be represented at the highest levels of abstraction, and also the concrete existence of our day-to-day actions. (A bit like The Handbook of Traditional Living but fleshed out and expanded upon.) I’ve got plenty of ideas along these lines anyway.</span></span></span></p>
