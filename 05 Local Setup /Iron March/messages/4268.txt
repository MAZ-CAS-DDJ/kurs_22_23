<p>A bridging culture and anti-Americanism are good. America since around 1945 has just been a menace to the world and nationalists at large trying to replace everything with American hegemony.</p>
<p>When America falls though (as it no doubt will - you see it as well) people shouldn't forget to preserve what's most precious. Not material possessions or a franchise like Tim Hortons. Firstly they must preserve their race and blood, along with what goes along with that - language, culture, and traditions.</p>
