	Hey just some tips for you, because I want more people in our movement getting the Military experience they need. When you turn 17 or 18 and start talking to a recruiter, they're going to ask you medical questions. Like asthma, how many times you've smoked weed, scars, tattoos, broken bones, allergies, etc. Do you have any serious medical issues that could be potentially disqualifying at MEPS? Let me know so I can give you explanations or excuses for it. Its gonna help you in the long run.
