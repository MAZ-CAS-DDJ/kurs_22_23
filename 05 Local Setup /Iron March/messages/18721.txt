	I got a question for you tough. Some guy on here told me once "Being fascist is more than an ideology, it's a way of life". But I haven't found any clues as what that includes.. like I could be living it right now, or not (to some degree, prolly not 100%) but i dont know what that includes/means.

	Care to point me on the right direction to understand more what he meant/what this way of life entails? (Especially in this modern world) Maybe something to read or whatever.
