<p>I agree that things need to change dramatically but I am not sure whether a total, systematic breakdown is necessary. I look at America in a similar manner as Rome, I think we could very easily be molded into this kind of grand, imperial nation while maintaining characteristics of the old guard. Rome started out as a Republican government and then slowly turned into the Empire we all know. Certain institutions remained, some left, some were absorbed into others. But most people often hearken back to Rome when they think of the archetypal fascist government.</p>
