	I don't talk to them online, i just see comments on facebook, reddit, news site comment sections, youtube, liveleak ect and they make me rage. I never comment let alone to or at them. My online presence is deff small. Away matches to start some trouble sounds like a good time, its always the ugly scrawny ones who larp about doing the "fash bash" and when they finally daydream enough to get the adrenaline up to try something they tend to get crushed from what iv seen in videos and heard in stories, even though they always out number.
