<p>And if you had joind IM at any earlier time it would've been quite different, the community has evolved since its conception so much so that it's embarrassing and funny to look back to what we've been and what we are now, but truly we've come into our own so to speak just at the verge of this year. From a srs conversation, no racism, antisemitism or trolling allowed, drugs are bad, NS =/= Fascism, "i'm concerned about some users using swastikas" autism to a fun allowed, gas the kikes race war now, Jackboot Shamanism central, NS = Fasism, Fascism = NS, and swastika as the default avatar basedness.</p>
