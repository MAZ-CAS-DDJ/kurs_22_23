	They haven't invited me since it is a Bulgarian movement. I tend to agree with you here, but it would be nice to cooperate with them and have some fun. We too need action.

<p>
	HAHAHA YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS. Slavros is the master here, nobody that I know of has a better understanding of Fascism than him, nobody knows the Fascist writings better than him; moreover, he not just talks shit (without reading the essentials like me) but actually does things - keep in mind that we can thank him for being able to speak with each other at all.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe he was against this idea because of practical reasons, but it also can be that I just used the wrong words. After all, I say that everybody should serve the same God, but according to their own best understanding. Jedem das Seine, you know. Does this autonomy means that each civilization works as a separate government? I don't know, but I am interested in your ideas in your next message. The question is whether if the top of the pyramid exists in this world or not - and according to the symbol of the point (even the mathematical one) it isn't, so it's likely that Slavros is right when he says that the manifestation of the Divine Authority, the Avatar will never bear the full power of the Divine Authority.
</p>

<p>
	The absolute final form of Fascism is God.
