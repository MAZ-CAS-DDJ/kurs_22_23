	Breivik just the two threads. But the Pennsylvanian is likely going to start hanging up some of the propaganda I've made soon. Also, I think it would be good for us all to meet each other in person before we go hang anything up. Seeing as we have two new people, I think everyone would be more comfortable if we knew who we were working with. Does this sound like something you guys would want?
