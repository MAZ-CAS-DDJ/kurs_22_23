<p>I'm pretty much the same <strike>guy</strike> celery stalk you all knew when I left, not too much has changed except that I'm going back to school soon (though I think I never really discussed my private life much on here anyways).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've enjoyed my break from politics. Honestly though I felt like I shafted some people (including you) by suddenly storming out the door with hardly a second thought like I did, so here I am, and sorry about that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Truthfully I'm still just as skeptical about a lot of things regarding this site as I was when I left, but I'm also not pissed like I was at the time. I'm not here to be a dick or anything.</p>
