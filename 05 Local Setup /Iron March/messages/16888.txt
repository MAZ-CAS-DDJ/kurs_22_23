	BTW, the FascitKurd lie about one IMPORTANT thing! Salah al bitar was an arab sunni!
</p>

	Fascistkurd tell:
</p>

<p>
	" I just view Baathism as Arab fascism, except it's less hardcore and much more bourgeois than real fascism. The two founders of Baathism, for example, were both intellectualists who liked to masturbate over "muh arab culcha" without ever standing up and doing any real or actual work with their own hands like a good fascist is supposed to do. And also, one of <strong>them was a Christian and the other a Shi'ite</strong>, " Yes, Michel Aflak is a christian of course, a greek orthodox one, bur Salah al Bitar was 100% arab sunni.

	I think he hate the arabs, the muslim, and esspecially the sunnis ones (and of course Saddam Hussein)
</p>

<p>
	BTW, I couldn't accpt an independdant "kurdistan" because the kurdistan is an irakian region. USA and ZOG system support a free Kurdistan only for the destruction of the arab nations.

	I hope you understand what I mean.
