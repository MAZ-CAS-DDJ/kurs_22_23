<p>To put the record straight, all of my protestant christian posts were troll posts and attempts to get people off the Jew-apologist and meekness crap once and for all and I think Mierce's are too since he was raised as a Jehovah's Witness and I remember his first posts were anti-religious, I could be wrong and he's entirely sincere though. Some of my earliest posts were attempts to bridge an exploited gap between heathens and christians. In my country we're not very religious and deep down never <strong>really</strong> have been, certainly not Christian and definitely not pagan for a long ass time - attempts to revive it are retarded, Hitler attested to that too, it is good to reflect on, nothing more, same as the British Empire - a new one needs to be built, not an obsession or revival of the old one.</p>
<p>I'm glad you like my posts, they usually just come out spur of the moment from thoughts built up over time. You know you're doing something right when you can't please everybody on the forum but are steering it more towards your views anyway. I rely mainly on base instincts and ask questions later. I honestly don't know why every red blooded male alive would even waste their time with libertarianism over fascism; there's enough freedom and fun and direction and it's done a way which is much greater than libertarianism with its excessive freedom which is bound to have the minorities impose their filth on the majority at some point. NS Germany was the best NS model to emulate, it had automobile racing and encouraged the manufacturing of raw beastly power from companies like Audi, Mercedes-Benz and BMW; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_%28computer%29" rel="external nofollow">first programmable computer</a>, and <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip" rel="external nofollow">innovation in general which was envied</a>. Who wouldn't be proud to be part of something which achieved so much in such a short space of time, imagine if it hadn't failed. Italy was unique in its own way also, it's too bad they weren't that good at war. Aside from Germany I don't know a single country with a fascist history which is overwhelmingly ashamed of its past; even some politicians here give some credit to Mosley for being a man who never wavered - it's a shame William Joyce gets so much shit, but I believe he'll be proven right. Commies are jealous they had no noteworthy figures representing their history.</p>
<p>I love being a fascist, it's great when you can be racist, fascist and still liked by blacks at your work despite not even caring about their acceptance - it's all about the way you present yourself, decency is key. Everyone likes rogues; pretty funny how you can land a Band 6 job in the NHS even when your boss knows you hang around with hooligans. They're always surprised when you come out with something historical or practical which they don't expect you to know. Sure kills the "braindead fascist" argument in its tracks and when you get some lib bitch grilling you you just tease her and tell her to stop being a bigot and ignorant of other beliefs.</p>
