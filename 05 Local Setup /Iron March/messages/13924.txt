	You can just leave it out, animals will eat it depending on what it is. That's what I do.

	I used to read books in Uni too, but I'd walk to a nearby park to do it instead of on the Uni grounds. I prefer reading in nature. People these days usually avoid reading where they can help it because they never grew up reading as a kid or getting a love for books, too much instant gratification from TV and games.
