<p>Hi, I'm zeiger, the maintainer of the fascist archive. You're welcome to post some materials to the archive if you wish. The link to the archive is at the top of the page.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute some of your dutch books to the archive, I will create a dutch section for you. The password for uploading files is ironmarchy.</p>
