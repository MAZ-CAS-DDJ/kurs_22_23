	 About the USD... our currency is heavy devaluated thanks to a economic policy based on clientelism, with the big social-democratic party of govberment PSUV, printing money to bribe the poor masses of the country, to mantain power. The lot of papper currency in the streets has devaluated theVenezuelan Bolivar.

	 The USD gained power, because this country does not have a solid economic production, and thus rely on imported products. The imported products are buyed in dollars... but there is also a heavy gobvt control, on the dollars that the companies and the population can have, this created a parallel blackmarket of dollars because made them too EXPENSIVE!
</p>

<p>
	 Also, the liberal-democratic opossition, has used this black market, too create problems to the gobverment, this by the spreading exagerated dollar prices, that the people recognize. The money value is just pshycological, the money worth what people said its worth! and opossition has earned this psycological victory.

	With a few houndred dollars, Venezuelan National-Revolutionarism, could grow faster andheavily,but this is just a mean to an end,we dont have boundaries to found money...
