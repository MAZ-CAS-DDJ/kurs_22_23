			Thanks lady, yes the guy is anti-Islam but the vid is interesting. I'm not on Skype/Facebook yet (I'm a 47 year old dinosaur lol) but let me know if you want to exchange email addresses (I understand if not for security/trust etc). Have you ever visited England? I have cousins in California.

	I feel like his videos are forced. The arguments are easily about stuff lost in translation. As a native Arabic speaker I think that way too many people don't understand the Quran because of the complex language that needs to be studied and understand. I have never been to England but my father's friend lives in England and some of my bf's family live in California. My email is shames.radi@gmail.com
