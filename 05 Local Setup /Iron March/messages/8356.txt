I still have 2 invites left if you would like one (<a href="http://keybase.io" rel="external nofollow">http://keybase.io</a> it's basically GnuPG encryption where your public key is a username that you can attach to your social media accounts, github, websites, whatever to validate it being you).</p></div></div></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Sure, I wouldn't mind having an invite, do you need an email address to send it to?</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Yep, make sure it's the email you want your public profile attached to since this profile should follow you through the Internet for years to come.</p>
</div></div></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Even any public profiles I use were made using disposable email addresses or email addresses I specifically made for the purpose. Thanks for the consideration though.</p>

<p>It's main purpose is connecting your profiles in one public name connected to a specific encryption key, so yea I can see why you wouldn't need it. It could still be useful down the road so if you change your mind message me as I get 2 extra invites every month.</p>
