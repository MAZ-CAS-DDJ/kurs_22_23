<p>I'm glad to see an increasing casual and logical reaction to subjects around here on things like drug use and "criminality". I think the overly harsh views and lack of education on drugs is one of the reasons we lose out to well meaning people who look to libertarianism. I've always though allowance for growing weed but disallowing of dealing it was a fair compromise, in the same way people can brew their own beer but not sell it without a license.</p>

<p>My main advice is to go back to using XP, that had the BEST tools for erasing all data when needed, I suppose it's just my personal preference though, I haven't looked at the newer operating systems.</p>
