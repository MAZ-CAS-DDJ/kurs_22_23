<p>I suppose I still do believe in God. I believe in the spirit, soul, and a deeper cause/impetus to the universe. Science does not seem to satisfy all of my speculations...</p>
<p>My Judaism has changed somewhat. I believe in cooperation between Christians and Jews. I no longer believe Christians are polytheistic or idolatrous, even if they are based on Torah or mishnah. Rather, I understand that B'reshit comes from Sumerian-Akkadian (pagan) creation myth. My views of cultural and racial identity and heritage have broadened somewhat.</p>
