<p>Stirner was an anarchist but not in the way Bakunin or Proudhon were (althougb he associated with those circles). His anarchism wasn't rooted in opposition to state oppression it was rooted in the desire for individual actualization and persona freedom from reactionary, outdated societal norms and restrictions. He was Nietzschean before Nietzsche, basically, and understood that man needs to essentially overcome himself through a sort of individualized, personal revolution.</p>
<p>Sorel was one of the early and greatest writers on syndicalism. He came to appreciate many traits of various antithetical movements because he was able to look past dogmatic restrictions. For instances he praised monarchism and tradition but was equally a devout, albeit heterodox, Marxist. He rejected and accepted points from all trends of his day. His most important achievement was his theory of myth, which basically stated that underlying all great movememts is some sort of myth which leads the followers to action. For socialists, this was the myth of the General Strike. Which he saw played out during the Paris Commune and the Russian Revolution. He also advocated revolutionary violence as a reactoon to social democratic gradualism and negotiation.</p>
