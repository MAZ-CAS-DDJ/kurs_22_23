<p>Do you regonize the channels such as GermanoLinke, Volksgenosse18, Parteigenasse, nationalgenasse etc etc</p>
<p>Well all of them are owned by the same left-wing Strasserite/National-Bolshevik. One which I have been in touch with, and yes I had a youtube account which I deleted a while back. I used to be in touch with SocialistFront19. I get most of my stuff from those youtube pages.</p>

<p>Ahh okay, yes I know of them. Cool. I know socialistfront19 as well, he seems like a smart guy.</p>
