<p>Well im not depressed about those years, but back then i have plenty of free time and now i just dont have enough...</p>
<p>From home to work, from work to home, family, dogs, organization and only small fraction of time for me, to smoke a pipe(tabaco not weed) or go drop some arrow. There aren't any positive change for now . Maybe if i lay up some cash until summer i may go to Wolin

Only obligation you have is to go to school and after that you are free to do whatever you want..</p>
<p>As for national officer you might start to gather supporters cuz for now its empty tittle. Watch some nationalist podcast in youtube for example. Sort out good stuff and create your own, made some videos, write article or two on some NBU Australia blog, about moderate things like emigration, social inequity, crimes   e.t.c Find people with close ideas and views try to do something together not necessarily offensive most like neutral for this stage..</p>
