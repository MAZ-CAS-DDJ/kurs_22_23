	Watch Varg's paganism series if you haven't yet and you get time. It's not so much about rituals and all that but it might help. I would never recommend anything touched by modern paganism at all. There's nothing that's really comprehensive about it honestly. There are bits and pieces from sagas, grimoires, Varg's works etc. You don't have to push yourself too hard initially to get that sort of stuff, focus more on the worldview than anything if you're interested in it. The rest comes later. Try to remember that the gods are not magical sky daddies or any of that sillyness that modern people always imagine it. They are forces of nature / the instigators of nature / certain traits or concepts personified.
