<p>Hello Svitanok,</p>
<p>I read 'aryanism.net', the website you had linked on a thread here, and there is much for me to think about. I need time to reflect, because some of it I think I might agree with, particularly regarding 'racism'. I don't agree with other aspects, but that's ok, I am beginning to think that it's starting from a good hearted initiative. It's interesting that some of the sources on the website i've read before but didn't see the connotations in quite the same way as the website's ideologue. We are frequently programmed by the 'Jews' in that manner, to see false dichotomies and contrarities. I'm almost 45 and i've been a 'Racist' for a long time, when i've had the tools of Aryanism and Christianity at hand to guide me, so to evolve a better position than the one I have or at least to modify it to reflect the truth will involve some humility, integrity, and courage. I happen to have a copy of the 'Protocols' which is frequently quoted on that website, and I plan on re-reading it, it's been decades and I need to dust it off. As i've said before, I firmly believe and intuit that it is not a 'forgery'. Thanks again, 'michaelarchangel'.</p>
