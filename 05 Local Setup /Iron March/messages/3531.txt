And people are like "But south is beterz!!111", south Korea is filled with degeneracy.

<p>I swear, it's the ideals of "Democracy" and American Multicutrualism that infects the eastern nations. the only reason the south is as "rich" is due to the United States shoving cheap materialism and american money + american values down the korean peoples throat.</p>
