	Yeah i mean I don't care about America at all I just want to save Europe that's where the homeland is, plus America is part of the problem. I don't really like American ways of doing things or our "culture" if you can even call it that. I suppose your right , I would like to go to Europe and help do something , I can't do much where I am I live in a majority non-white city there isn't going to be any great movements where I am.

	Back in highschool I used to believe Hitler literally when he said the slavs were bad. Now being older and more learned on certain subjects I'm mostly just hoping to actually return Europe to the way it was. I was hoping to have a family one day too but at the rate things are going living in an ideal society looks like its not going to happen. Honestly I don't know what the future holds but I hope we can change it.

	I feel like Hermann has a lot of questions in his life some similar to mine, like what he's going to do with his life and such things. I mean he's not doing well in school , I try to encourage him to do better but he doesn't really listen. I think it s probably all the drugs  which he seems to enjoy. He doesn't show signs of wanting to stop using and I think he's just dealing with life differently.

	Your actually one of the few people that I've had a serious conversation with on here I really enjoyed this, speaking of trust can I give you my email because I'm not on here all the time, my email has my real name on it so I've never given it to anyone here , also it has a pic of me an old one but Only Hermann and Vino have seen my face.
