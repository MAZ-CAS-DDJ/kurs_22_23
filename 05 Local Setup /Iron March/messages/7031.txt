<p>Nice shipwreck, reminds me of this famous shipwreck on Zakynthos, Greece. I was there during holidays once. <a href="http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140202162047/animaljam/images/7/7e/558325-1920x1200-shipwreck-beach-zakynthos-greece-wallpaper-1920x1200.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140202162047/animaljam/images/7/7e/558325-1920x1200-shipwreck-beach-zakynthos-greece-wallpaper-1920x1200.jpg</a> So you live near the ocean, that's cool I guess. I don't know anything about PNW, it just seems so far away. Post more pics if you want. What kind of accent do you people have? I associate Americans with this NY accent becuase that's what I'm most familiar with from the movies. You probably sound totally different <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> In Croatia I always liked the Zagreb dialect the most, it sounds a lot like Slovenian. </p>

<p>I'm half way far in my studies, I plan to go all the way and then try to become professor or something like that, don't know how realistic it is but you have to have goals. I just had a hard exam today, and last weak I had a flu, so I wasn't out much in the last two weeks. I could finally go to drink some beers with my crew, I'm feeling better immediately. I had horrible 2-3 weeks.</p>

<p>So you know Thompson, watch Croatian national football team.. You're almost like a real Croat. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> I always cheered for Croatia on this tournaments, Slovenia doesn't make it through qualifications most of the time. Croats always had cool patriotic songs about their football team, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-bwHpP5nP4" rel="external nofollow">this one</a> is nice, great video too.</p>
