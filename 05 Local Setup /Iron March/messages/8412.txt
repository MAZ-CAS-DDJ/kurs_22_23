<p>Yeah, I'll give you the same recommendations I gave Noidberg, who also seems enthusiastic about studying esotericism. As a starting point, read <a href="http://laraj.ca/files/Frawley%20-%20Real%20astrology.pdf" rel="external nofollow">Real Astrology</a> by john frawley, because it's entertaining and informative. It also ends with a good bibliography with notes to get you started on astrological knowledge. Since astrological symbolism is fundamental to all other branches of legitimate esotericism (alchemy, magic, traditional medecine, whatever), it's good to have some basic grounding, but Frawley goes beyond that and really drives home the difference between the traditional world view and the modern world view. Once you're done, you can read <a href="http://laraj.ca/files/ChristianAstrology-I.doc" rel="external nofollow">Christian Astrology</a> to get a detailed knowledge of what frawley only alludes to.</p>

<p>Once you're ready to branch out, I can only recommend Agrippa's three books of occult philosophy. It's a summary and synthesis of over 200 ancient and medieval books on every subject related to esotericism. <a href="http://laraj.ca/files/1%20v3.pdf" rel="external nofollow">Here</a> is my cleaned up version of the first book out of three. I recommend you buy the Donald tyson annotated version once you get the dough and the inclination.</p>
