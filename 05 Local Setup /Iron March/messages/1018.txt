With the huge impact he's had politically, culturally, it just in real life in general, I didn't want to miss his F..king insight.<p>Keyboard comandos will generally fight pretty hard to retain the spell they have over their imagined flock, who they truly believe respect them. So it's really no surprise.</p>

<p>Other than making cynical whiney posts.</p>
