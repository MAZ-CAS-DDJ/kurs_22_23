<p>The problem with the verb wehren is that practically always it's reflexive. Most expressions with it include the word "Sich", which is like the english compounds that go ___self. So normally you'd say something like schutze/beschutze/verteidige deine Heimat instead. With wehren you can say things like "Europa wehrt sich" (Europe defends itself) or the imperative "Wehrt euch!" (defend yourselves). Wehren is kind of an awkward word to use due to the reflexive quality.</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>
