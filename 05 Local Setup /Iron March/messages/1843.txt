<p>Hey, I am just curious as to what exactly the forum rules are in regards to copyright and such. To be specific, I picked up a pretty fascinating book of social history of various fascists movements that includes a lot of contemporary academic approaches to and interpretations of the various fascist movements. I've noticed the forum has a lot of biographical info, links to source materials and IM members original thoughts but not much of the kind of thing I'm talking about. I wouldn't mind typing up a few of the essays for people to read here. I can't find any of them on the interweb and the book itself is out of print and quite pricey (it being out of print I wonder if there is any kind of copyright/ip violation in the first place). Here is the ISBN if you are curious: 8200053318</p>
