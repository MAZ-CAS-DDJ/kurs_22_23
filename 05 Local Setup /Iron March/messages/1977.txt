<p>BTW, do you have Filipinos in the CNP?  If you know of any Filipinos around who know about your ideologies, suggest you tell them about Ironmarch as well. Our Nationalists (true nationalists, not the liberal-nationalists who say "people power 1 is nationalism") in my country are very few, and hard to contact.</p>
<p>And if i call myself a Kimilsungist, people here would kill me, and call me a communist. Not to mention i have very little time in making a political group.</p>
