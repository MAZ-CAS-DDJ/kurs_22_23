<p>That is pretty much where my interests lie, but the problem is that many primary texts are long and most people, myself included, wouldn't have time to translate them without some financial compensation. Message boards, of course, are good for disseminating information and this is particularly helpful in the case of fascist/right-wing thought, which often gets ignored or suppressed by the mainstream. But nevertheless, if people can't read the primary texts because they don't know the language, then a lot remains inaccessible to them. Thus it is inevitable that most of the people you get on an Anglophone fascist forum will be Nazis/WNs, because Mein Kampf is widely available and, along with a few other scattered texts, that's all most people know about fascism.</p>
<p>On the level of practical politics, CasaPound does almost everything I would do. When I researched their program and tactics, I was surprised that their model was so similar to my own. They are also loyal to the authentic fascist vision, but then again Italians have access to lots of literature on the subject that Anglophones don't. But they have a strong presence in cities like Rome, so it yes, it does work.</p>
<p>Did you sign up at Salo Forum? I know it might not seem like a serious site at first glance, but it has the most potential of any other board. It already has a strong core of intelligent posters with views similar to ours, and they only need more people there to motivate them to engage in more discussion. I also know the board's moderators wouldn't let it degenerate into Stormfront stupidity. If you tell me the username you plan on using, I can tell them to approve your account ASAP.</p>
<p>Also, I've found this website, which has some good articles, though it is not updated that frequently:</p>
