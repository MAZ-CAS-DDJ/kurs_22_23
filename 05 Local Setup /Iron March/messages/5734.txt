<p>How can you make changes to the system from the inside if you're frightened of making your opinions known? How will you enact these changes if that is the case?</p>

<p>I know many people who have stood as BNP candidates and still have very good jobs, yes, they don't make their politics an issue at work, but they're still politically active and all an employer needs to do is a Google search to find out about their politics. So in many cases any concern over employment - especially if you're involved in the softer-edge of nationalism - is more a product of fear than anything else. <br /> </p>
<p>If you are genuinely in a scenario where you can't be active at all, you have two options: 1) You don't join or stand as a candidate for any political parties, that means there is no paper-trail back to you, yet still attend meetings and leaflet. 2) Just donate. This is more of an option for people who earn serious money and can afford to give large sums. </p>

<p>Just to give you a bit of background on myself, I'm currently at a prestigious university doing a proper degree - not one of these mickey-mouse degrees - with decent grades and relevant experience in a sector that has very competitive salaries; yet I'm still involved in what could be described as the hard-edge of Nationalism. I play the smart game - no photos, I always write under pseudonym and keep the chat about what I do to a minimum. Thus far, I've had no trouble. None of my professors or peers know my politics, they think I'm some traditional conservative who likes Peter Hitchens and Roger Scruton. So, I'm just telling you that it is possible.</p>

<p>One thing: nobody legitimate throws anything through anyone's window. Nobody puts anything through anyone's letterbox, nobody goes training in the woods, wearing army fatigues and air-rifles; if you come across anyone like that than they're an agent provocateur and to be avoided at all costs. Those are the people to really watch out for, not your local NF activist who might drink a bit and have a bit of a weight problem.</p>
