<p>1. welcome - always nice to see another Briton on the forum. DO check out getting avtive with National Action (as long as you're not middle-age, or older...) Regardless of ideological specifics, it really is the only UK based organisation which is going anywhere.</p>
<p>2. Read the thread:</p>
<p><a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/3261-fascism-restoring-tradition/" rel="">http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/topic/3261-fascism-restoring-tradition/</a></p>
<p>That should clarify where the IM faithful are coming from.</p>
<p>3. DO try and stick around. It really is a great forum once you 'get it.' However, if you really want to stay, then you could do worse than signing up at Lumine <a rel="external nofollow">Boreali</a></p>

<p>I'm a mod there (don't mention I sent you; I don't want Iron March thinking I'm poaching their members!) We're a mix of Traditionalists/integralists/fascists/national socialists. </p>
