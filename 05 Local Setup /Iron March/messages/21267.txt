	Yes, instability and chaos is good for us in that it creates opportunity for us where previously there was none. Still, we're a bit unorganized and this will negative for us going into the future. There needs to be more massive organization. I am also worried that the establishment is going to throw us into a world war or if a thermonuclear exchange globally is possible given recent events. Â Interesting on the exams, how do I apply to them?
