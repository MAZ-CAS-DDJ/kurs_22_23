<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>For me, nothing really new; i still do odd jobs, taking care of my little family, organize ceremonies, and the activist work.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Very nice.  It's awesome that you are doing activist work for your culture and nation.  There are many activists these days, but too few are for the right cause.</p>

<p>In time, he was in the ARB (Breton Revolutionary Army) and was responsible for relations with the IRA and ETA, and welsh autonomist.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That sounds very impressive!  What can you tell me about the relationships between these groups?  And what more can you tell me of the ARB?  I believe this is the first I have heard of them.</p>

<p>Studying a language without alphabet but with sinograms teach us a lot of things, a different kind of mentality and communication.</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p>Ouch!  I forgot Chinese doesn't use <em>any</em> alphabet.  I must question the logic of such a system.  Do you know why the Chinese have stuck with pictograms, as opposed to developing a more efficient system of writing?</p>

<p>In time, as the era of my father, the family lived together under one roof: uncles and nephews, aunts and nieces, cousins​​, grandparents and grand son.</p>
<p>They lived for eight pieces. It was an organic community, and everybody knew themselves in the city because of the relationships of kinship.</p>
<p>Now, an isolated family is no longer anything at all, sociologically it does not mean anything,  and divorce does not astonish me.</p>
<p>How can we live in being alone, without any external help?</p>
<p>It may be difficult to design for an Anglo-Saxon, but in the Latin countries, solidarity between people does not exist.</p>
<p>I think we should go back to concepts more organic, more rooted, like the man always lived.</p>
<p>And not favor the concept of modern, atomized nuclear family which is the basis for commercial and consumerist system.</p>
<p>For housing or work, for example, each generation must start over at 0 now.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Are the only choses group living or isolated families?  In America, nuclear families have had separate houses for ages, but they remained close by so they remained a subunit of a larger whole. </p>

<p>revolutionary ideologies are unavoidable.</p>
<p>We all must study marxist-leninist-maoists theories for the practice and the analysis.</p>
<p>I do not like their ideology, but their practice is the most successful.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Understandable.  But what practices do you admire in particular?  I am a fan of Lenin's vanguard party, but I do not think any good can come of a Maoist people's war or anything like that.</p>

<p>tests only selected those who have the ability to answer tests, that's all, nothing more.</p>
<p>in history there are leaders who were enormously way to school.</p>
<p>What should be the criteria for these tests? knowledge =  belonging to a social class, or intelligence = criterion which measures nothing?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Part of the criterions for an effective is predictability ie how well does this test predict the outcomes of the individuals it tests.  So theoretically a test could be constructed that predicted an individual's ability to be a "good citizen."  Now this begs the question of what measurable traits can we use as markers of good citizenship.  This is a tough question, I concede that much, but I do not believe it is impossible.  For one, lack of a criminal record is a good, measurable trait.  Intelligence is another one.  Not a "who was the fifth president of Iceland" trivia intelligence, but a complete this equation, interpret this verse, find an abstract solution to this complex problem.  And, of course, the test would need to take more social considerations than merely criminality.  Citizens should be engaged individuals who lead those around them.</p>
<p>It is essential that the ruling class remain fluid and open to anyone regardless of his/her social background.  Otherwise, we would have traded a class system for a caste system.  </p>

<p>I don't speak about the homosexual sexuality, but about the culture and the network, homosexuality is a lobby, perhaps the most powerfull after the jewish lobby.</p>
<p>Almost half people in media, politic and especially culture are homosexuals. Homosexuality promotes an ultra bourgeois society.</p>
<p>Himmler or marxist-leninists  correctly identified the problem.</p>
<p>- At work or in politics, gay help each other to the detriment of heteros.</p>
<p>- Economically, two salaries per couple and no family, they are big consumerist, and thus influence the economy.</p>
<p>- They are cowards and perverts.</p>
<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Ok.  I can agree that the pride parades and the general queer pride culture is degenerate and something we must overcome.  Otherwise, I can see no reason to vilify homosexuals.  Attacking them because they have two incomes and no dependents sounds like petty classism to me, and the average homosexual is no more cowardly or perverted than you or I.  It's just a loud, minority movement inside the gay community that has cast homosexuals in such poor light.</p>

<p>A return to roots is inconceivable outside a socialist system.</p>
<p>- Because of the material concerns predominant among individuals, and also wealth or security.</p>
<p>- Because of  lobbyies, homosexuals, Jews, anti-racist, feminist, pacifist, drugged, Freemasons and all these things.</p>
<p>- Because of the open borders and immigration, inevitable consequence of a free market.</p>

<p>Seems we've got an old-fashioned chicken and egg dilemma right here.  I would agree that the political sphere can not be molded in this modern, neo-liberal capitalism, but I think a culture of tradition is taking root now.  This burgeoning traditionalism and economic populism would be a good way-station on the path national socialist society. </p>

<p>An alternative to acculturation, multiculturalism or chauvinism (only the national culture).</p>
<p>This means that we consider that cultures are equal, as we study them, but that 1 ° we do not mix them 2 ° we focus first in our culture and knowledge dissemination 3° there is no subculture like mcdo, iphone and hip-hop.</p>
<p>Ethnic homogeneity is suitable so it does not drift into multiculturalism.</p>

<p>Thank you for that.  Seems like a perfectly acceptable society.</p>

<p>Except in the USSR period, paganism has continued in the Baltic countries, there is still almost a third of pagans.</p>
<p>After it's like Christians, it is not because they say they are more pagans that they do pagan rituals and know all the mythology, but it is interesting to know this fact. And I do not even speak to you of Lapland, there is always shamanism.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That is encouraging, but still pales in comparison to the hold liberal Christianity has on the West and amoral hedonism.</p>
