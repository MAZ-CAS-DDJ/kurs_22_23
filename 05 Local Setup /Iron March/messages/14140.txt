	Well Xav, I have been thinking about it and maybe this time I will just ask Steam to remove all of the games from my account, so I don't have a relapse again. I swore of video games a while back but then I played Mount &amp; Blade even though it was fun, it reminded me why I gave up gaming in the first place, it is just a waste of my time. What do you think?
