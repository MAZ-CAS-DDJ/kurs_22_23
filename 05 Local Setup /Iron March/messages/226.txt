I understand it can get annoying. The commie hasn't been as offensive as barton or especially FC, at least so far- he's still pretty new. I'd put ethno on your list as well- my god, I haven't seen this much fighting between the original members at all! It's pointless drama really, but it's quite interesting.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Oh gods, Ethno. I would have interned him myself if the damn Control Panel would tell me how; so I had to settle for raising his warn level up a point. And disrespecting Mierce like that was so outrageous I damn near deleted him out of spite. And you are utterly correct that the originals don't fight; I think we all kinda settled on the old forum. Most of us/them are not even original. Most of the true old guard kinda faded out with the exception of a handful; and the International Fascist Forum is hardly even remembered. *snorts at self* I'm talking like a nostalgic 80 year old!</p>
