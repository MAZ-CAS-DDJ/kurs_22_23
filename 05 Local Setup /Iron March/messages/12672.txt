<p>... Jesus blows up a snake? I need to read whichever book that's in. Mythology as a whole is pretty wild. Even my liberal parents are wondering what a Trump presidency would be like, so if the Donald is appealing to Hillary supporters, that could steal some of her thunder in the inevitable showdown. Ayy! Are there really no ski resorts near you? Back in NM, we had a bunch of places in-state, and that's also the desert.</p>
<p>Yikes! And that's a lot of wives too. Can say the same of British education- we had to put the British Empire on trial in history class, and are constantly guilt-tripped about our minor role in the slave trade.</p>
<p>Whereabouts in Germany is your family from? Are you all giant Teutons? I'm of Alpine farmer stock on my dad's side, so we're built for the mountains. Little brother's already developing The Browbone (which isn't heritable in the female line, thank all that is good in this world). Do you have any siblings?</p>
