	Been very busy with things lately, so I haven't done any acquisitions recently.

	Well, the contemporary art world is in a very difficult situation, but it seems like things are improving. In England, for example, Prince Charles personally supports traditional architects because he agrees with the principles of traditional architecture and wants to preserve at least the rural areas from the ugliness of modern architecture.

	Overall, art is in a sorry state though, even modern-ish and degenerate figurative art is frowned upon by the art critics. If it vaguely looks like something real, it's dismissed as not artistic enough. A friend recently told me, when we were having a discussion about art, that she knows someone who studied art for a while and the profs there usually use "figurative" as a criticism, if you can see any kind of form in it, it is not artistic enough. Modern academic art has to be so abstract you need 10 pages of text to explain what the artist wanted to paint.

	Nowadays, the best art in my opinion actually comes from illustrators of fantasy books and things like that. Traditional art is considered "trivial", but there's some not bad stuff among it.
