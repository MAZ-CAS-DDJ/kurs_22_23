<p>Seeing the Blackshirt Loyalist fb "closed group" page, of which we both have joined, makes me ask, what do you think about creating a fb "closed group" page for American Blackshirts or the "American NBU" or some such title?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thinking of this as a possible tool where individuals may feel more comfortable expressing their opinions and with a view to gathering support for the NBU.  It is, after all, a private forum without what some may view as the strident tone, for example, Iron March.</p>

<p>I have had exchanges with 3 persons in the US - friends or acquaintances - whom I know possess fascist sentiments, by en large, but they prefer to keep to safe labels such as the Tea Party.  As I am certain from your experience and being on the west coast, the clouding of the cause with Antisemitism is a concern for many in this country, regardless of whether or not that sentiment should be: it is, arguably, not how you receive the message but how you (and others) perceive it.  A "closed group" might be the way to open the crack more.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>
