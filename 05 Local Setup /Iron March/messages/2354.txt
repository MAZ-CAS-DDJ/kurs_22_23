<p>Yeah, it's a tough crowd here. I think you know that now. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> Not sure whether or not you lurked here for long before posting, but I've learned the hard way that's usually for the best on online forums - work out the lie of the land, etc.</p>
<p>Anyway, like I said, I applaud you for putting forward a system, and hope you don't let the bastards grind you down! There's really nowhere else quite like Iron March on the 'Net, but you do need a thick skin...</p>
<p>My label "technofascist" is not really signifying much: my philosophy is very much under construction, but I've a strong belief that science and technology, rather than democracy, is the way humanity can improve itself and its quality of life. This is not only through things like eugenics, but the use of, say, something like a space program to act as a uniting national force [as an alternative to the usual one of war!].</p>
<p>Good luck on getting yourself our of the wastelands. Probably best not to mention Warhammer again!</p>

<p>I just wanted to say thank you.</p>
<p>Your post was totally what I had hoped to find here.</p>
<p>A welcome and some help rather then an attack.</p>
<p>Also I am curious about what a technofascist is.</p>
<p>Now I have a BASIC understanding of true fascism and would like to know what the techno portion of.</p>
