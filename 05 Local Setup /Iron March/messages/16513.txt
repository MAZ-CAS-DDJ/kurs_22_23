	Â I'm all European maybe I have some Native American from the colonial days , probably not though I had DNA tests done , I'm all Aryan I matched people in Afghanistan and Northern India for the regional haplogroup , the R1A1 group so I'm descended from the original Indo-Europeans that came to Europe from the steppes. For the local gene groups I matched everyone in Germany , Scotland , England , Norway the most.
