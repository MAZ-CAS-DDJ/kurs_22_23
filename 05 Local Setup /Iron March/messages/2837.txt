<p>So then, FasCap, as you may recall, your ban was lifted under <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/1196-formal-petition/page__view__findpost__p__30396" rel="">specific conditions</a>. The time has come to collect.</p>
<p>We're in the process of hiring a webdesigner firm that will create our new and vastly imporved Fascist Archive, you are being called upon to pay 40% of the price for the final product, so by our current estimation your contribution will be at roughly 1000$.</p>
<p>If you decline this chance to backup your promises to this forum and its community you will be permabanned.</p>
<p>I expect an answer from you by the end of the week.</p>
