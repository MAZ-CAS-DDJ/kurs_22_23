	We all used to do a podcast together, and it was a process that we all went through over time. For me I found Fascists to have the best arguments. Really the only true arguments. Philosophies inherently have a materialist view of the world. Captalism and communism are the same thing. They focus on means of production and workers to the exclusion of genetics and nature etc. We stand alone for nature. Against the forces of disunion which would destroy us forever. We are the blood, violence, and spirt that can revitalize the whole planet. I believe that because of our blood we have an infinite potential and have only to reach out for it, which means ultimately giving up a material life for a revolutionary one.
