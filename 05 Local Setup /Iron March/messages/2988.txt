<p>Thanks for the recommendations. It is true what you've been saying since you've been here. Capitalism is the ideal tool for a true conservative/fascist state to be successful. Many on here are taking economics for more than it is, it is what it is, economics and a tool. As far as I can see so far, nothing is better than capitalism and productive private enterprise. I don't see why people automatically associate so-called free trade with open borders, multiracialism and liberalism.</p>
<p>I have done contract work in various countries over the years yet I've always took an understanding of economics for granted. I read some Keynes and the proposals and suggestions just seemed stupid and non-efficient.</p>
<p>I think one problem is that a lot of people associate capitalism with stock market swindlers and people like Bernie Maddof, rather than productive inovators and good products.</p>
<p>Keep up the good posts.</p>
