<p>Thank you for your long reply! Bulgaria sounds like a beautiful place but itis a shame to hear about the political situation. You say things are close to civil war? Is this true? Are there many Ns or Fascists there? What do you think of Russians?</p>
<p>I am actually first generation Australian. I was born in Germany and came to Australia when i was 4. However my parents are American. All my family are Americans with German and English blood.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing back from you, comrade.</p>
