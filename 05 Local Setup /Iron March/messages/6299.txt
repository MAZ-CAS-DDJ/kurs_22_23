<p>Oh hey there!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Good to see you on here (finally)!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was going to tell you all about my exploits on here on Wednesday, however, (and plz keep this to yourself)</p>
<p>I overdid it at the gym on Tuesday night, came home and was on here until ~0530 - then slept strait through my alarm until ~1030.</p>
<p>Thinking there's not much point going now (and still being tired/sore), I just called up with the first excuse I could think of whilst half asleep and offered to come in on Monday to make up the day. Then kept on sleeping till ~1400.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyway - I was having too much fun trolling my intro thread (to the point of it becoming a hot (!) topic) with some rather risky and contradictory history. Unsurprisingly - there seem to be a few acutely informed people that promptly shot me down having realised I was either full of shit or the first "Ustaša" in history to praise a Communist dictator.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jokes on them though - I know both sides far too well (paternal grandmother had a hard time shutting up about her good ol' days as a ex-Yugo Communist party member) and could keep the charade going for a while - just to see people's reactions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After all - what's the point of constantly being proper and accurate if you're on an anonymous forum? Time for some jolly fascist fun!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh and as I mentioned before - the name Svarožić was (still is technically) my hacker name.</p>
<p>The name of our hacker alliance?</p>
<p>SoC ... Slayers of Conformity!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No way on god's green earth am I ever being a conformist on the internet! <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
