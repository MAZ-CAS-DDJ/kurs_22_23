<p>I have already noticed. And my flat turns into a mini Baghdad during Ajax games, and ridiculous shouting of "JOOOODEEEEN" hah.  It's very hard living in a flat with people you can't trust for anything. But beleive me,  both of our countries are going through the same processes, that's why in my view it is very important to network among people with potential with similar views. It is good not just for achieving political goals but as well as for building an infrastructure around us for achieving personal and common goals.</p>

<p>Some familiar places in the video you sent me. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, a little lesson on Dutch history for you would be more than just appreciated, I'd happily visit the memorial.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Send a salute to your comrades from me, have a nice day and good luck with your plans.</p>
<p>Also my schedule is very laid back till beginning of February, so any time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank You.</p>
