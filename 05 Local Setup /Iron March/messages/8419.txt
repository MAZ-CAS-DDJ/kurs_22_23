<p>Before I start uploading things, I'm a little concerned with spelling and grammar issues on the archive. To correct this, I'd need to take down some of the uploaded entries and re-upload them with a proper, more standardized format. We ought to be striving for a professional look here. How do I go about doing this?</p>
