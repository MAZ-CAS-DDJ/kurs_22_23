<p>Nothing more to summarize at this point, they haven't released any information yet, and due to the bomb threat they maybe won't go through with the conference at all. But when/if they write a detailed report as originally intended, I will translate it. It's possible that it will be published in Finnish at patriootti.com anyway, as there are supposedly some Finns (from SVL most likely) taking part in the event.Â </p>
