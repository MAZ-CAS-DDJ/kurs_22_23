<p>Damn, brother.  That's heartbreaking...</p>

<p>As if it couldn't get worse, the liberal cattle here are already planning on "moving to Canada if Trump wins".  Democracy.  Where people are only supportive of it so long as 51% of the population are supporting their dimple-faced candidate who sounded good enough to get elected.  Once a candidate they personally don't like gets elected by the will of the majority, then argh, racism, time to leave! (they never do because a liberal's word is meaningless.  but be wary.)</p>

<p>I give America a fair 10-20 years before a major catastrophe that swings the pendulum far to the right, and 30-40 til an outright collapse, something that must happen if this country is to become truly great again.  That's also not counting natural disasters and so forth.  I'll take the training and experience that I get from my time in the Marines assuming I'm not killed or maimed wherever I'm sent, and give it to whatever fascist movement arises from the ashes.  If something that massive happens down here, I think it would help Canadian nationalists directly.  We are culturally similar, which is why it was easy for jews and socjus and so on to 'get at' Canada through American media.  The subverted, Jewish-owned, consumerist American media has got to go.  Sickens me how low America has fallen.  Which is why I'm almost embarrassed to call myself an American nationalist now.  If it weren't for that, I don't think Trudeau would ever have been elected.</p>

<p>The other problem is college students.  Yeah, I see what you mean about them, and I don't blame you.  I question what I'm doing here almost every day...  only because NROTC requires me to. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>College students are seriously the dumbest fucking idiots in the world.  Raise the voting age to 25 at least and watch as liberalism falls into the seasons of the abyss.  And I'm not even 25 yet!</p>

<p>The part about the combat veterans/fanatics being White is a very truthful observation.  And it's sad that the warrior spirit is indeed wasted on lowly insurgents while we gain nothing from the conflict at home (other than more non-Whites).  My MOI is an intimidating guy with 4 rows on his uniform.  Deep, sapphire blue eyes.  He's pretty friendly, but from the way he looks at you, I know he's a killer.  It's interesting to be surrounded by men like that, then step foot back into the civilian college setting with lefties and domesticated, soft, very <strong>unintimidating</strong> people.</p>

<p>Whats Canadian sniper training like?  Sounds like hardcore nordic arctic warfare if I've heard of it.</p>
