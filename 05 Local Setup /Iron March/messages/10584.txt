<p>Yeah I have some experience, towards the end of my political involvement I got seriously clued in as a part of a small anonymous sec, so there are certain things I can do. Feel free to email me about anything. I have extensive experience with tor etc...</p>

<p>Ah, fucking sweet I've done a lot of hunting (small game) and use methods that are not only humane but totally legitimate on common land using hunting slingshots. They're fantastic.
