<p>Yea, I'm aware of Romanian territorial claims against Ukraine <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> Ukrainians who demand territory from Poland, Belarus, Russia, Romania, even Hungary and Slovakia, exist as well. Border fiddling is vain. Actually, I'd go as far as to call it dangerous. It leaves room for international Jewry (or other deceivers) to take advantage of any ensuing disputes and increase their stranglehold over the nations involved.</p>
