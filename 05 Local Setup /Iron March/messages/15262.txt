			At no point am I being charged with anything, I have not committed an offence, they can't even come up with a non-binding pre-charge. They are expanding the investigation by combing my computer for the next two and a half months for anything they can find.

			Police in England and Wales are not tied to procedure like US cops as long as it gets them results - they will either suceed or fail miserably. Just to give an overview - My arrest was false, the search was SUPER illegal (they were looking for alex and justified the raid and my arrest based on his case, his name and offence is on the search sheet of my flat), there was no itemised list of what they took, denial of trade (they stole all my camera and equipment even though it had nothing on it). This was done on the basis that my fingerprints were on an "stop aids" sticker placed outside a LGBT centre. On the day of my arrest they find CCTV footage that exhonerates me of any crime. I am bailed for two months, come back and they are now looking for material likely to incite racial hatred. So that is three separate junctures, it is laughable.

			They will be doing their best to find something, if they fail I can sue them for ridiculous money.

	That's good. I got a case against the San Francisco Sheriffs for this fight club ring in the kitchen in the jail. They paid inmates to fight for Hamburgers, I refused and told them I would steal the burgers from the kitchen instead, not fight for food I dont even like. They put me in a "safety cell"(suicide thing, naked or with a green toga thing to wrap yourself in, cold as fuck, a grated hole in the ground to shit in and they gotta flush which they only walk around to check evry so often) and beat my ass for it. I got out and called my mom,she called them as she doesnt fuck around and got the highest up in the jail,so they had me call her and tell her to take the complaint back and where threating me, but my mom always recorded my jail calls and all ones she with them. You could hear them threatening me in the background. There is a big lawsuit and ill get major payoff in due time guaranteedÂ
