<p>Seen it. Also seen all of Rice's interviews with Bob Larson as well. It's good stuff. I haven't watched this one in forever so I might just to brush up on it, don't remember much of it. There is an interview with Tom Metzger and Schreck though that I remember as weel and thinking Schreck came off horribly.</p>
