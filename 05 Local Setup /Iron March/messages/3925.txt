<p>Political situation are same as other countries in eastern Europe with only difference that those problems are  laid in centuries old ethnic and religion tensions that waiting for someone to light the fire. Actually the "open society" and other Soros organizations are prepare us second "Kosovo" in Rhodope mountains. As a part of "Islamic arc" on Balkans that connect Turkey with Albania and Bosnia. That all happen with blessings of US ambassador here. Just wait several years and you will see same shits with only difference that our army was disassembled.</p>
<p>Yes have many nationalist some of them are smart and thinking boys other.. well they are pretty dumb <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> but you cant choose your comrades.. After 2009th there is no political power  trustworthy enough to unite us. And this was really discouraging, but soon we will see where the things will go. The ting are not hopeless though. There are some attempt to alliance in our major movements but its hard to build something on rotthen foundations..</p>
<p>As for the Russians. Well they are in period of recovery after Yeltzin drunkard era, and politicaly are way better than western Europe and their EUSSR. But my personal opinion is different i dont hold much hope on union with them. They are imperialist fuckers and you must think twice before even start planing some cooperations with them. Both we and Volga Bulgarians have long history with them, history that was not always pleasant. Even that pro Russian politic on government level its way promising than  pro EU one.</p>
<p>Your parrents do right live US for Australia. After all USA is a sinking ship. If dont happen a miracle there are no internal factors that will led to some political change that will favour true Americans. But we will se in time..</p>
