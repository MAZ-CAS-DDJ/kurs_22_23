<p>What a coincidence, I live in Bijlmer as well, station Ganzenhoef to be precise. Reminds me of American movies, something surreal. When i was coming here i had even not close of an idea how many niggers you can have in one place. That's a funny law you guys came up with the vests. OH that video, yeh i guess it's pretty popular hahha.</p>

<p>Is it what you're trying to say with "not the most intellectual week" it's just a bunch of skinheads? haha And I'll think about it sounds interesting, and i haven't traveled for while aswell. </p>

<p>I think I will the time most probably so it's more down to when is more comfortable for you. We can do whatever really. I'd prefer just a walk and a nice chat. </p>

<p>Im jsut wondering what do you think was the moment that made you think NS is the right thing. Because I have really noticed that Holland doesn't have a big far right movement does it?</p>
