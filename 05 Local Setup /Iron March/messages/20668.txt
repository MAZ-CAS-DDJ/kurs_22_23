	The holocaust is a billion dollar industry and greatly exaggerated. The gas chamber claims are flimsy as fuck and now they say it all was in territory the soviets occupied after the war. Coincidentally Jews had a lot of power in the Soviet Union. Of course there were concentration camps as jews were racial enemies. And Jews would be shot on the Eastern front as they were commonly commissars and partisans. It was how they helped maintain control in occupied territory. Not only that but bombing supply lines and such meant some jews starved in camps and many did die of typhus. Zyklon B was a delousing agent. There is a whole lot of stuff you can find debunking the holocaust.
