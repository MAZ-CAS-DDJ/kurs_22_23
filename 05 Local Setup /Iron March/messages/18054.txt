	Hello again friend,
</p>

<p>
	I am seeking an interested party to help me develop a few things. I believe they will take a lot of man hours and will certainly not appear overnight. After the planning stages I would like to set in place deadlines (as a general guide to time, nothing as strict as it sounds, obviously we theoretically have all the time we want), and be able to push more polished, full versions to the broader community once we have something worthy.
</p>

<p>
	1. A National Socialist curriculum of a fairly ambitious nature: from Kindergarten to Tertiary levels. Encompassing an efficient, well rounded pathway for intellectual and character development (personal skills and physical training)
</p>

<p>
	2. Manuals for Order of Operations: 
</p>

<p>
	* Operational Security, both IRL and online (I know resources abound but I would like to coalesce and streamline a superior version<br />
	*Group development and guidelines for operations IRL
</p>

<p>
	*Anything else my mind may have skipped for me moment.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Let me know if you are interested, and we will keep this between ourselves for the time being. My instinct tells me to keep this isolated to my own 'cell' but I am seeking collaboration so that the process can be sped up and so share knowledge and common development.
</p>

<p>
	My goals for this are to:
</p>

<p>
	1. Counter the apathy of individuals who in all reality, are just seeking leadership/ direction.
</p>

<p>
	2. Build the character of all committed comrades so that in their personal lives they have a grip on financial/ social skills and can therefore pursue families, day to day lives as well as our meta-political lives
</p>

<p>
	3. Leave a framework to be built on for successive generations to improve on the previous ones
</p>

<p>
	4. Create fanatics, Ubermensch!
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, even if not for the present, let me know. This is an open invitation.

	<em>I teach you the overman. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?… All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood, and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is ape to man? A laughing stock or painful embarrassment. And man shall be that to overman: a laughingstock or painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape... The overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth... </em>

	<em>Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman—a rope over an abyss … what is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.</em>
