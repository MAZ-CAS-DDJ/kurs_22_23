<p>Hey mate. Tbh all is a bit messy at the moment, hence not posting.  <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_laugh.png" alt=":lol:" /> Looking for work, personal life, all that crap's been piling up. Cheers for the heads-up though and I'm not against meeting up either, we seem on the same page and I'm sure we'd get along. Probably in a few weeks' time'd be better though- if you're down in April or May I reckon things'll be a lot less chaotic by then. Anyway- 0419 149 439 for me, and my name's Nik. </p>

<p>Hope the mines've been treating you well. Later mate.</p>
