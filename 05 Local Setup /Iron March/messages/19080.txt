	Hey.

	I can't believe I've never noticed the post about SIEGE before, seeing that it was made in 2015. I haven't been able to be active as much as I'd like to lately, for personal reasons, so that's likely why.

	I was wondering if there was a physical (softcover) copy of SIEGE. Recently I've had the idea to start a 501(c)(3) (non-profit organization) that does community outreach, local charity type stuff. Part of it was to focus on books, giving literature to local organizations, donating books to jails for the inmates, libraries, and things of that nature. I came across this book, have yet to give it a read. I did look around for myself and I do see a hardcover, which is good for myself and maybe some others if I manage to get it in with other things. But I'm wondering if you know of any softcovers, that way I can give it to jails or send it directly to inmates. I know there are also some others that only take softcover.

	Let me know if you have any info. Also interested in other books, preferrably some that may appeal to more moderates, for this same reason. While I do outreach I can slowly slip in some nationalist works here and there to reach people in the area.
