	I don't want to make you a Catholic, I am not a Christian myself. What I want is you to be forced to take a position instead of saying "well the nature just is" and do the Scientism talk. Read that book I mentioned, it's really a good one. I am in the middle of it right now. Protestantism sucks, but judging Christianity or Monotheism by that is like judging Paganism by Wicca. What you described is called Agnosticism, isn't it?
