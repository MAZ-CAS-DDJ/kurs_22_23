<p>I also touched on determinism and theological determinism, I guess the point is if the is an unmoved mover ( god deities whatever all in one) and we do indeed have a pre ordained fate and free will ( there is much contention on this issue especially between Buddhists and Hindus) the point of following our divine path will lead us back to the divine</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So in essence if the divine created us as separate conscious streams that all return to the divine and if reincarnation exists the real question is</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What is the point of consciousness ? Why if each consciousness ceases to exists after it's life has run its course and returns to the spiritual world of god ceasing to know that a self or selves have ever existed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So add that to determinism which essentially is a giant canvas of a divine power assuming that we are part of this divine power, doing things it sets out to do meaning everything that will or has existed and happened. Comparable to running a computer simulation each small part does something but is at the same time a part of the larger machine and after the part does it's work it ceases to function independently.</p>
