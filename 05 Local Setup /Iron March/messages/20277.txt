	Sorry for being an asshole but I am new to this. I started to look for friendley people that had the same ideas that I could connect with. Now I cant do anything. Im not a kidm im 16, I have a car, and for fucks sakes I have a job. Someone along the way told me to come to this website to find others. Well its not working out so well. Im lost....Confused. It wont let me type a new introduction. Im sorry. Could you shed any light or knowledge on how I could get myself out if this mess? Thank you. Sorry for being a pain.
