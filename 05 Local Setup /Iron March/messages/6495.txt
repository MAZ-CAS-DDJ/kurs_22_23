<p>1. How is the architecture of modern buildings corrupt, and what building style do you feel is ideal?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. These questions are a bit off topic, but i feel still relevant:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- How does your economic plan differ from that of fascist corporatism? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Do you support the idea of work-vouchers/Labor based currencies? Why or why not?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- How would food be distributed if all farms are state owned. Would it just be brought to a market and then bought by people, similar to the modern system, or would it be given to each person directly. Would everyone be given the same amount of food? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sorry if i'm bothering you, i'm just sort of curious about these things. </p>
