	I went over there with my dad for a holiday. Flew into Manila then onto Boracay. From my experience it was a filthy place. I would've loved to have spent time on a range. Yea I had a couple of Aussies message me when I joined. Seems like there's more than I thought. Its a pleasant surprise. Sounds like you've got it all sorted. Good for you. I'm treading water with my life!
