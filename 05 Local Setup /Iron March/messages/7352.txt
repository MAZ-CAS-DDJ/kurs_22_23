<p>I like that a lot, I haven't heard anything like it in some while.<br /><br />I have been gone in the woods for a week! We took some youth up there for a Bible Camp. It was a really beautiful place, we took them hiking in the mountains and riding horses. I like spending time with the young kids, it makes me hopeful. What have you been doing?</p>
