<p>You have my full attention, look forward to what you have to say. It is my aim to create a secure line somewhere, I was taught a bit about web security and other things and quite a few people here know what they are doing. When I can get Torren back on his feet we are going to have a TORchat on our own dedicated server - it will be completely impossible to break, plus I don't think we are being watched.</p>
