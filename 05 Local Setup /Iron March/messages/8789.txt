<p>I'm pretty good with kids. They seem to like me, at least. Suddenly (no idea why) the ten year old girl from next door has been coming to our house. She's barely literate, I dunno if it's her parents fault or her school. But I've been reading her the kiddie books I used to have when I was young, because my mother never let me throw anything out, ever. There is an entire room of our house full of my old toys. But, I digress. I've also basically adopted this Bulgarian kid. Well, he's a teenager, not really a kid. But, I've been teaching him the ways of fascisms. He's probably my best student.</p>

<p>I have such an urge to post pictures on my ex's stream, and her profiles, of her with Nazi flags, and sieg heiling- and watch all the faggoty little beta-male "fans" who donate money to her just to hear her say their name and go "thank you so much)))" so they can pretend a woman is interested in them for five minutes of their life shriek in horror. I wouldn't do it, of course. I don't want to upset her or hurt what apparently makes her happy. It's all just disgustingly dishonest. It'd be as if your fiance sent you a message one day saying "Hey, I got a new house, you can come visit me in the hollywood hills any time you like. Oh btw, I'm a movie star now. Cya."</p>

<p>...And with that I promise I'm done complaining. Rant over. Won't mention again. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
