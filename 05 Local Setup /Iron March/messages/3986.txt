<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Man, I was about to private message you earlier but then declined to send it for some pathetic reason.</p>
<p>Not only is Nietzsche dear to my soul, but I'm in South Australia too. I like what you've written on the boards, I've floated over your user name a few times.</p>
<p>As for your latest "Me, Nationalist?" topic, I disagree with the first reply. Personally I consider myself a 'good European' and in the final analysis the fate of Europe will decide the rest. The anti-colonialist invective and the Indigenous rights rhetoric, together with 'the proposition nation' and 'we're a nation of immigrants' mantra makes Fascist or overtly nationalist Australianism almost completely unmarketable. Deracination and contempt for our heritage are basically national sports here.<em> Ironically, even fortunately, this exact sentiment supports ethnonationalism in Europe! </em>I often point that out to the podlings whenever given the chance. It's amazing to me how many Australians have never considered themselves 'indigenous' to anywhere. "Who are the indigenous peoples of Europe?" - this has confused <em>crowds</em>. :\</p>
<p>That said, there is a growing new nationalism emerging here without coercion. And many young 'normal' Aussies sport southern cross tattoos (even on their necks) - once thought only to be signs of the 'feral' underclass. I find it a bit tasteless tbh, but then again, the culture is crude.</p>
<p>But as for yourself, if you don't feel married to it, <em>don't fake it</em>. I'm a nationalist in a Nietzschean sense - my nation is <em>my kind</em> - all those who consider the only measure of a State is to be found in what kind of Man it cultivates and recognizes are my people. That said, in debates on issues and so on I always take a broad Nationalist stance (In Nietzschean sense - not what is 'good' but what is great - collective self interest infused with honor) - not what is good for the political class, or what sounds good to shallow ears. The baubles and trinkets, even the flag and the Kangaroo'd emblems mean nothing to me - the spirit of 'nationalism' should not be confused with its material culture.</p>
<p>Bah, too much to rant on here, I'm unworthy. .</p>
<p>There's an interesting anti immigration/pro nationalist angle when living in democracies and which is the best angle for jarring the debate in the 'former colonies'  (especially) that I'm surprised I rarely hear from 'respectable' tongues. And that is that under a one person one vote system who we allow into our nation should be of <em>primary concern</em> to us all. Indeed by their character and identity they either augment or dilute our own political power. Universal suffrage should offend us, not make us feel 'good'! We should discriminate ruthlessly but without egotism, not only at newcomers but among one another - the standards are so low and popular morality so infantile that we are actively watering fields for Nietzsche's Last Man. This democracy and liberty as 'goods in themselves' is a shallow sickness.</p>
<p>A lot of these guys (here at Iron March) seem caught up in their own particularisms and lose sight of the wider lens. It's frustrating because I share many of the same critiques as the left regarding 'petty Nationalism' in the narrow sense and yet between great gusts of refreshingly 'forbidden' sentiment here the crash of petty nationalisms rings out. Still there's some interesting stuff here and cross pollination is vital.</p>
<p>The culture war is crucial. Left-liberal mores should be openly mocked, but irreverently so, not maliciously (unless you're in compatible company). Expose the cretinous ressentiment of these humourless evangelicals. Remember when the left were the underdogs and the conservatives came across as stiff necked out-of-touch caricatures? Well, the tables have turned. Laugh as your deflate them. Mock them jovially, pop the balloons but make sure you use a sharp pin.</p>
<p>Gah, my pessimism is extreme and my apathy is long past me.</p>
<p>Hope i didn't scare you, haha.</p>
<p>I'm glad you tapped me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Well met.</p>
