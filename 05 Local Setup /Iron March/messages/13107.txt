	Yes blacks will go everywhere. But they will stay out of small boring white communities the most. :) pity we cant start our own township and make it fully white no masons or gov housing..

	I like Orania in South Africa. Yes its a joke how many use dogs for children. Its bizarre. People are too selfish. I want another baby so bad. My maternal instincts are going crazy. I dont think ill ever be able to stop having babies while I am able to.
