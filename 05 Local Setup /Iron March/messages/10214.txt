<p>America was already intervening by that time. Kuwaiti oil tankers were going under US and UK flag and protected by US and UK warships against the Iranian raids. At that time Iraq and Iran was at war and Iran tried to wreck the income of Iraq. If you look at the map the invasion of Kuwait was a really important geopolitical act considering Iraq has barely any access to the Sea and all trade they had have to be done across Kuwait not to mention their sea is near the Iranian territory so not safe at all. </p>

<p>I wonder how the Iraqis feel about Saddam. Even the statue crashing pic that the media used is staged and fake. The Americans planned it and they hired the people to be around. It's even on wiki under "psy ops" so not even a hidden thing. I still think Gaddafi, Saddam and Assad were important people in stabilizing the middle east and North Africa. Now we have millions of "refugees" that will be forced on Europe and so on. If there wasn't Western meddling in that region we would have way less kebab around. American interventionism is basically for business interest, Iraq had oil, Afghanistan has metals needed for batteries etc. Not to mention the western man's crusaderism for "democracy". I hate democracy first of all it is a stupid idea it's like the passengers flying a plane instead of a pilot. But it would be less annoying if it wasn't a lie. People elect "representatives" who never ask people just vote according to current fads and party lines. </p>

<p>In Hungary they usually say "even if I agree with a jobbik policy I will not support it" because they don't think practically they only care about the BS fluff of politics at least on a communication level towards the people and this is annoying for me. I don't fancy Jobbik too much... let's just say it has it's own problems...</p>

<p>Personally I don't believe in the Race war, maybe in the US the identities are so clear it can be done but in Hungary... We are pretty much related to all the other people around us ie Croats, germans etc. and for to be a race you need to be human so gypsies doesn't count. haha I would say they are a different species. Their bad part have the paki values, forced marriage etc, they hate the whites and they keep so much trash on their yards. No wonder they were chased away from India, you know where they worship rats as gods. </p>

<p>I think Africans could do their continent well if first, they would stop whining about colonialism. They are more than welcome to be kicked out of the early middle ages. (same goes to the native americans and aboriginals... what land they had? they never got out of the stone age for god's sake. medieval france could have invaded and killed them off or hell even the ancient greeks, greeks had metal weapons and organization etc.)</p>

<p>African countries are rich with natural resources but they never reached that part of the social evolution where they have nations. So they are struggling between having tribes, people, religions etc. They lack a big unifying feature. For example that is why Gaddafi was good for Lybia. Sure they didn't had gay parades (appex of civilization according to libtards) but there was stability and peace between the tribes and islam sub sects (sunni, shia).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So yeah. Africans should fash for their own good and democracy sucks.</p>
