<p>I didn't really answer your question. In Stirner I saw an author who had a good insight i to how the individual betters themselves through rejection of morals and laws which, upon examination, have no objective value. I have a wealth of respect for "system creators" or people who shed the ignorance associated with the disease of a time we live in through internal struggle, revolt, and ascension.  In Sorel, I found the first real critique of Marxism that I agreed with. Despite being a Marxist, Sorel rejected the supposed scientific infallibility of it and was an idealist, in opposite ti Marxism 's materialism. Also, the concept of myth leading people towards action left a big influence on me. This notion, when viewed historically, seems fairly sound. Also, I fully support violence.</p>
