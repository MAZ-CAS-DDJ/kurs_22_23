	I saw your response to my introduction and found it interesting, I will explain what I think the genetic makeup of Romanians consists of.  I believe the origin of Romanians are Dacian, but the question is: how Dacian?  We probably will never know the real extent of how the Dacians mixed but, I think we can start with the Celtic tribes invasion of Dacia during 4th century BC, we can guess that there was mixing there and Romanians probably have a little bit of Celtic blood.  Far more influential we can guess was the Roman invasion, which probably resulted in a lot of mixing, and explains why Romanian language is similiar to Italian in many aspects.  Many other migrating tribes went through the area like the Visigoths and even some Slavs, we can also assume they mixed with some of population as well.  Most notably its safe to assume Romanian blood consists primarily of Dacian, and Roman with mixes from the other peoples I mentioned above.  If you have another theory I would love to hear what you have to say.
