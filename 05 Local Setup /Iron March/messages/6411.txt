<p>Interesting, I've devoured a lot of de Benoist's, Sunic's and Faye's works and I must say I consider their 'camp' to be very promising. Whilst the metapolitical strategy is just that, rather than a movement, I find Faye's enthusiasm for building a comprehensive ideology to be compelling. In fact, Faye 'follows' my old blog under his nom de guerre of 'Corvus'. </p>

<p>Archeofuturism, and Faye's notion of 'Vitalist Constructivism', deserve much more attention. The idea of a dialectical overcoming of the conflict between Tradition and Futurism is too good to overlook. </p>
