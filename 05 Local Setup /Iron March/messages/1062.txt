<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>Unfortunately (well, fortunately for me) I've decided to go to Southeast Asia next month, after exams are over... specifically Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei.  No commie countries though (fuck Laos &amp; Vietnam!). I'll be away for a couple of months so I don't think I'll be able to do that article for you, which I apologise for. When I get back I'll check to see if the next issue of Reaktion has been done- if not, I'll let you know and write it up for you. However, it's probably best to cross me off the list for now. Sorry about this, realise it must be a bit of a pain in the arse for you.</p>
<p>However, if you do want an article about national syndicalism I'd suggest maybe asking the member NSA if he'd be up for writing one. If you read any of his posts he seems EXTREMELY well-informed on the topic, much more so than I am to be honest. He also seems capable of writing clearly and coherently, which is always a plus.</p>
<p>Apologies again. Looking forward to the next issue regardless, even if my own brilliance isn't splashed across its pages.</p>
