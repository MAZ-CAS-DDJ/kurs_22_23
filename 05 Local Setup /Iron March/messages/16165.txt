	What do you think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berberism" rel="external nofollow">Berberism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azawad" rel="external nofollow">Azawad</a>? Maybe we should have an 'Algeria' topic in the <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/forum/36-fascism-by-region-country/" rel="">Fascism by region &amp; country forum</a>. I hope that you will be able to make a strong movement in Algeria with the knowledge you have collected from the different parts of the world.
