	Since you said you were willing to learn I figured I'd make myself available if you have any questions while you read the starting material here. Personally I think you should start with A Squire's Trial. It was written by members of this forum and if you'd rather listen to it you can do so in about an hour and a half. Let me know what you think of it, and if you have any other questions let me know. <br />
