<p>Sorry I took so long to respond. I am trying to do several things and participate on this forum at the same time.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="180" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>I share your concerns about this forum. I see the Jews as having an interest counter to those of European Nationalists albeit I just don't support extermination as a solution as many of the more extreme Hitlerites do.</div></blockquote>
<p>I don’t support the policy of extermination simply because I don’t believe it is possible to execute successfully. Just imagine, if we tried it there would be Jews hiding everywhere and many people would probably help them hide/flee from us. It would literally end up like what happened in those fake Holocaust tales.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="180" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>This forum does not share our opinions on race being important to the nation and is way too authoritarian for me. Could you imagine if some of these red white and blue waving fascists came to power here? They think that everyone that wants to break up America should be hung. The one guy even said in his essay that people who say "niggers aren't american" need to be locked up. We racialists would end up like the Anne Frank story hiding in an attic. </div></blockquote>
<p>That’s a pretty ridiculous attitude to take if you ask me. This country is bound to break up if any of the races which came here are to survive. The fact is that at this point we cannot deport all of the non-European types out of here, so I think we need to give them different parts of the country for themselves. It’s the only solution really, even if we could deport everyone we wanted to, we would lose a lot of the population and it might cripple the economy if done too quickly. I once theorized that it could be done successfully if we did it slowly and gradually enough, but I think that it is best to break up the U.S. at this point into different racial homelands.</p>

<p>Just to note, Else Christensen had to go hiding because the National Socialists suspected her of being part of the Danish resistance, not because she was a Heathen.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="180" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Anyway, I think we should continue to use this forum to converse even if we/you don't post (I might post a bit yet). It is a lot easier for me than e-mail.</div></blockquote>
<p>Personally I think email is easier, but if you want to stick around here I guess that’s okay. But I hate this forum because most of the audience is not even open to the views I want to present. I would like to be on a site on which I know I am speaking to people who will actually take me seriously and think about what I have to say. On this site, I swear it’s as if everybody is either a soldier or a gangster (i.e. a grunt who just wants everyone to just march in line). This place is also sort of like VNN, it’s a vulgar, online version of a male locker room full of “tough guys” who like to beat each other up.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="180" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Did you see that Russian "National Syndicalist - futurist" guy in the "Debunking the Palestinian Lie" thread. God damn, alls that guy needs is a yarmucle and shylocks (if he doesn't have them both already). I felt like I was reading straight from Fox News.</div></blockquote>
<p>That one I believe also supported the Holocaust theory on that Hitler and the Final Solution thread, he sounds like a total Philo-Semite.</p>
<p>I was reading your introduction page…</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="180" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Hello everyone, I am a Strasserist from the USA. I think, due to some of my ideology, I will have problems fitting in here. I always welcome a good honest debate though and I look forward to many of those. For example, I am a racialist and a supporter of "blood over borders" nationalism which I know some are opposed to and also I am opposed to authoritarianism and militarism. </div></blockquote>
<p>It’s interesting, "blood over borders" nationalism. I think that was exactly what I was trying to teach you back on Socialist Phalanx when you rejected race for a minute there.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="180" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>My biggest inspirations are:<p>…Julius Evola </p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>What do you like about Julius Evola? There are only a few things I like about Evola, but I kind of hate his overall philosophy. In essence, he argues that we should all live in stratified, patriarchal caste societies which he justifies using some occult bullshit ideas. He also denounces a lot of spiritual beliefs I have as being “lunar.” Most of what he calls lunar spirituality is good stuff (although that’s not to say that what he calls solar is bad).</p>
<p>To elaborate, Evola’s teachings obviously have some positive aspects from a conservative racialist-nationalist perspective, especially in his criticisms of the enemies. You’re already aware that his teachings on race had some influence on my thinking (although I might say that he is simultaneously somewhat misleading when it comes to race as well). However, I find his doctrine as a whole unacceptable, especially his idea of Tradition. What he calls “Tradition” is actually a mixture of practices and beliefs which are not always actually part of what I consider to be proper traditional Aryan practices, even though a few of them are. Evola takes things too far; the ancient European way of life did include a hierarchical society ruled by a monarch, but this elite was Folkish (i.e. to love the people as a whole) and socialistic, even though it practiced a simplistic tribal form of socialism. It was not some rigid caste system with an aristocracy obsessing over strange spiritual ideas which no one really believed (An example of what I’m thinking of is Evola’s idea that we need to be “initiated” to become immortal and the whole “solar”/“lunar” distinction, which is something I believe he is really wrong about).</p>
<p>Man, I can go on all day about Evola.</p>

<p>Interesting, I remember when I first informed you about the Captain, I first felt as though you sort of didn’t think much of him. Now you list him as a major inspiration.</p>
<p>Did you happen to read the essays I sent to you yet? Any comments or questions?</p>
<p>Also, on a side note, I happen to have found Romanian lyrics for those Legionary songs I sent to you in the past and I think I can translate them. In the past I didn’t have the lyrics and I couldn’t translate the songs because I couldn’t quite hear what they were saying exactly. But now I am able to see what the songs say and I can give you the lyrics in English when I have some spare time to translate.</p>
<p>Oh, and I saw that you believe the Khazar theory. That theory is trash. Read this article here by Revilo Oliver disproving it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.revilo-oliver.com/rpo/Another_Jewish_Problem.html" rel="external nofollow">http://www.revilo-oliver.com/rpo/Another_Jewish_Problem.html</a></p>
<p>Note that Oliver is a bit crazy, so don't take all of his anti-Semitic remarks seriously as he sometimes manipulates facts when it comes to the Jews. But I think he is right when it comes to the Khazar theory.</p>
