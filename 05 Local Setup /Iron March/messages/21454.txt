	I write this with a heavy heart as bad times have come upon me. Theres no use for a account that doesn't do anything here. I was doing that long enough before, and I apologize for that. I should've diverted some time here but I lost track of everything. Right now isn't for me to contribute though, the police came by my place because of my involvement with "questionable" individuals. If you can't delete this account then I guess it has to sit here in cold storage. I'll wait ten days after sending this message, after the ten days are up I'll try to log into this account. If I can't and the account doesn't exist anymore, than I thank you. If it still exists, then I guess I'll come back to Iron March at a better time.
