<p>This is a big issue to me because I'm still in school. Something like this could fuck up everything ahead of me.</p>
<p>I'm aware it isn't much for real, as you had said it isn't prison or anything. </p>
<p>I'd rather keep low for now. I have plans to join the military and if this is on my records then that's done for, most likely.</p>
<p>As you might know, I'm also a mischling which is bad news, because I could probably be disowned or something. </p>
<p>I also have to talk to a rabbi about the holocaust in a few days which is pissing me off, I am being forced to talk to a rabbi and it is garbage.</p>
