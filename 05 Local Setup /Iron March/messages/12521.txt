<p>Well, the bible even the old testament is the most anti semitics thing ever. The entire chapter of Jeremiah is God's condemnation and casting off of the Jewish people. If the jews had been good they would not have betrayed God time and time again. </p>
<p>I'm of the opinion that God "chose" the worst people in the world to send His son to, to show the depth of his forgiveness to those who are willing to be loyal to Him, that He gave even the worst traitors in history a chance to follow Truth and change their fate. But the Jews were proud, and fell like Lucifer. Jesus said to the jews, Ye are of your father the Devil.</p>
<p>With folks like David, I don't think he was honored, I think it is to show that even the vilest wife stealing murderer can have good made from their lives *if* they are willing to give their entire being over to God and admit and confess their sins. </p>
<p>There's a possibility and a good one that the jews of the ancient times and the jews of today are two totally different peoples. Google khazar converts to read abt it. (Actually don't Google anything, start using duckduckgo) I haven't looked into this much but it would explain the Synagogue of Satan verse in Revelations. </p>
