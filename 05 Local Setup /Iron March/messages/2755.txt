<p>Fascism you can dance to. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>Less facetiously, my sig quote from Moseley more or less explains the concept.:</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">"Science must be the basis of the technical State of Fascism. In the modern world the function of the state is largely to keep the ring clear for the technician... Fascism, not only by money but by honour, will repose its faith in the scientist."</span></p>
<p>It's a belief that science and scientific progress is a - if not <em>the</em> - core element of Fascism. That applies both in obvious area such as eugenics, but in terms of providing a goal around which the nation can unite and work toward with passion - for instance, a mission to Mars. It's a lot less risky than the usual Fascist one of war, where if you lose, you tend to be fucked! When you don't have the sheer number of your enemies, you have to be better than them, and science and technology are the most obvious way to accomplish it.</p>
<p>Thanks for asking.</p>
