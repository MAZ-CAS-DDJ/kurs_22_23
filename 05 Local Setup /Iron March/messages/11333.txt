<p>Well it may be difficult given you're based in England and they are a rather reclusive US group.</p>
<p>There IS a UK affiliated group, called the Drakon Covenant, they follow the ONA and Vampirism, like ToB do.</p>
<p>Their email is drakonc@protonmail.com (I think)</p>
<p>If you decide to email them, use the word Nekhala, its a sort of password.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>
