<p>That sucks! I've never had to deal with behaviour like that, and honestly, drug abuse frightens me beyond belief, so if you're lying to me... Well, I'm essentially in a situation where either (or both) of you could be lying to me, and I didn't ask for this. I came on here for comrades and discussion, not drama and disappointment. School's enough of that, especially with important exams right around the corner. How's uni?</p>
