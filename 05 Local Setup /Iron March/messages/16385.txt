	Yeah I'm still waiting on Zeiger to actually give legitimate input, he's taking too much time on that, so far he just said this:

			a preliminary comment would be that it would be great to do a noise reduction filter on the audio<br />
			and also, put some quiet retrowave music in the background for more of the video<br />
			in terms of the cutting, i'll have to take notes while watching it

	My personal input is that it feels more like you just made a few gag moments, not the direction I was expecting tbh. I was hoping for something more comprehensive and with more continuity, hence the idea of maybe making a series of videos that can be comprehensively edited throughout with the works, big showy and flashy stuff, and the overall complete video with just minimal effects and a nice soundtrack playing throughout the whole video.
