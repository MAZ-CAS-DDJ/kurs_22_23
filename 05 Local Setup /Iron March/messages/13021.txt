	Hey there
</p>

<p>
	How are you?
</p>

<p>
	Was reading this old thread and love your opion of my racial classification. Ie if I am pure white or not. My known Ancestry is Irish English and German. All from relatives who came over long before white Australia was abolished. 
</p>

<p>
	Is there a way to upload a photo?
</p>

<p>
	I have done DNA testing which says I am 100% white. But I do think I look unusual for a white. I definitely feel very white and staunchy Identity as white.

<p>
	Thank you 
</p>

	Keirra :)
