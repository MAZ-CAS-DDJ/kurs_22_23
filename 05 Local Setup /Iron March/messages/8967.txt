<p>Yeah, my name's Chris mate. I could have spoken to you yesterday but I tend to get caught up in my own thoughts at these events, and forget to network as effectively as I should. Medium height and build, short dark blond hair and beard, wearing a black Lonsdale hooded jacket, dark blue jeans, and a pair of Doc Martens. Anyway, I'll hopefully catch you at another event.</p>

<p>As to what your research has uncovered, that does look a bit worrying doesn't it... What do you reckon to taking our concern straight to the people at the EFF? Granted, whether we can trust <em>them </em>is a whole other issue, but at least to see what (if anything) they have to say about it. Could be something we've overlooked.</p>

<p>Thanks for TextSecure. I looked into it briefly, and it definitely looks like it'd be useful for us - whether it's arranging demos or private events like yesterday's. As for the email, I will take you up on that offer, but what's a good email client to email you from? I use Hushmail and Safe-mail, but I know they're not 100% secure. And Proton-mail is full up for the time being. Any alternatives?</p>
