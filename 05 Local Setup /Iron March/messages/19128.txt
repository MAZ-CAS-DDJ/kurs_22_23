	I'm actually enlisted in the Marine Corps myself. I ship out in the summer. I honestly think now is the best time to join before it gets <em>really</em> shitty. Its still the whitest branch, and trains men thoroughly unlike the other branches. I doubt we're gonna see another ground war within the next 5-10 years, but I could be wrong. Only 3% of the fleet is currently deployed.
