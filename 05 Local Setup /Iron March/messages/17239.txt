	Nah. I am sure that there were thousands of pro-Yugoslavian Croats, and that there are still thousands who are against the whole Croatian-Serbian opposition.

			Region will stay weak until it unites. It's funny how NATO took strikes only at Serbs, not at Croats or Muslims.

	Yes, and it won't unite until the people who live there won't bury their dead and solve this problem without outer powers, but together with each other. Of course NATO attacked you since Serbia was the unifying force in that region. Croats believed the same lie almost every post-Socialist nation believed at that time, namely that the West only wants to help us. About the Muslims... after the Yugoslav wars the NATO have destroyed Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, at the moment they are spreading chaos in Syria, Ukraine and Turkey. They don't give a shit about religion for they don't have ideals, only interests. Ffs, the average Serbs sees them as pro-Muslim while the average Muslim sees them as Crusaders.
