	Hello I just wanted to point out a couple things that an experience activist expressed concern over with me about the org.  He pointed out that there is an American Vanguard Corporation that will eventually get after you for trademark infringement.  Also he thought you were not a legally registered organization, which would eventually lead to them getting all of the organization's records (all emails etc) via subpeona, since you are taking money.  <br /><br />
	I'm glad your org is listening to IM and I hope to join it in the future when I'm completely confident in project.  <br /><br />
	Hail Victory!
