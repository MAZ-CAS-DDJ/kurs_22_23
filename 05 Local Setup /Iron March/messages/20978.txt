	Same. There's literally nothing else the Corps is good for. I joined the Marines because the Army didn't have any Ranger contracts. Its cool that there's more people joining up here. It will help our cause in the long run forsure. There's even a possibility that we'll see each other in the fleet one day. We should definitely keep in contact after boot.
