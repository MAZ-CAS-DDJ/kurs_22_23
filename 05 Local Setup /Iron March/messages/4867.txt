<p>No, alex is fair most of the time. He doesn't explain himself, but he acts when people are clearly out of line. You get yourself into a lot of shit because you assume things a lot of the time. It makes you seem very passive aggressive most of the time. People have a hard time following you. when you share a story or make a point you need to explain yourself more to overcome the language issue.</p>
