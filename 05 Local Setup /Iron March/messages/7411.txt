<p>Check out the house set I posted in musical thread. I noticed a lot of our younger guys (from NS/hooligan scene) are into electronic music. Definitely a positive trend, I was practically the only one from my generation who was interested in this scene. The coolest parties with the coolest sounds, fortunately here and in former eastern europe there aren't that many degenerates on techno/house parties. You should go to techno festivals in Poland, some of my friends were there this year and they loved it.</p>

<p>If you think about it, all those fascists who're so bitter about modern world that they don't know how to have fun anymore are total idiots. With all the degeneration this world still offers hundreds of activities for fascist-minded people to enjoy in our own way, it's much better than it used to be in the 60s, 70s and 80s.</p>

<p>Do you know the Russian NS band Kolovrat? Here's an interview with their guy Denis when he was here in Slovenia, we had plenty of great NS concerts back in 2010 when the scene was still very good</p>
