<p>Going pretty well for the most part. I was in your state here a few days ago. Went up to Syracuse, then over to the Bronx in NYC, then i believe we went to a town called "Fishkill" and from there went to another town called "Marlboro". Was an interesting trip. My Dad drives a truck for a living and had a few loads to deliver up there, and he asked me to go along. </p>
<p>Anyways, how are things going for you? Haven't spoken in a while. </p>
