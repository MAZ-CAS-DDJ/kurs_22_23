	Hey man, welcome to the forum. Nice to see more Christians around. I ship out to MCRD in August. Just had a couple questions since you're an 0311. My Ssgt said I cant contract a job until July or something like that. I'm trying to get a slot for 03 myself, best option would be 0311. Is it normal to take so long to get a UH signed? I enlisted December.
