<p>Ah Comrade, I'd be glad to verify my position.</p>
<p>I'm more of a Monarchist than anything else (I like to think of myself as a Monarchist in the old Hindenburg, Aristocratic German style), I have an Extreme Militant Opposition to Communism and Democracy, and I generally favor an economic system closer to Capitalism (Not Fascap Capitalism) than Socialism or Corporatism,</p>
<p>That being said, I take elements of Fascism, Monarchy, General Authoritarianism, and Conservative thought and blend them together to create a mixture.</p>
<p>You could say im 45% Monarchist 30% Italian Fascist 20% Traditional Conservative 5% Various others</p>
<p>On specific issues I can more clearly define my platform, I find a general outline to be too broad.</p>
<p>I've probably haven't fully answered your question however, I do hope you understand a little better.</p>
<p>Cheers Comrade</p>

<p>Well, what exactly is your opinion of national socialism? I notice you have some of the Reich's artful propaganda in your display picture (great picture, by the way) &amp; I certainly mean legitimate national socialism - not "hurr hurr muh aryuhn mastuhr rayse" bullshit, of course. </p>
<p>Overall - I've managed to get along with Italian fascists better than anyone here aside from other national socialists. History repeats itself, eh??</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Sieg Heil, kameraden.</p>
