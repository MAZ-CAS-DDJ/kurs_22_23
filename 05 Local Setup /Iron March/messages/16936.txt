	Very interesting. The further back you go, the hazier it becomes. The point you made about pushing back toward the closest previous age makes a lot of sense too. In fact, that might be my main problem, since I'm trying to go straight back to the source itself, without gradually going up the ladder of Truth step by step. And actually, isn't this also similar to what Evola mentioned about "conquering Christianity through itself" or whatever it was (something along those lines)? Because, without that step by step process (and actually, perhaps even with it), contemplating this topic can really drive you crazy, especially as you try to edge closer and closer to that mythical and mystical point of origin. And to make things worse, the forces of modernism, and the current state of Involution we're in, are constantly trying to hammer you down as you try to push your way toward thoughts that really do seem to be not only unspeakable, but in fact just unthinkable. Again, this keeps reminding me of Wittgenstein, who talks about the exact same thing in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. You should definitely read that one at least. Tractatus 6.54 says: "He who understands me finally recognizes [my statements] as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it." And he says the same thing in the book's preface too: "The aim of the book is to set a limit to thought, or rather — not to thought, but to the expression of thoughts: for in order to be able to set a limit to thought, we should have to find both sides of the limit thinkable (i.e. we should have to be able to think what cannot be thought)." Again, it's a crazy topic. You really feel like you're trapped when you think about these things (or at least I do). It's like you're trapped and you're desperately trying to break free in a frenzy. Maybe it's your soul trying to break free from the shackles imposed on it by your body (including by your brain, of course). Again, it's insane.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover… whether it's a Medieval person looking back on Antiquity, or a modern person looking back on the Middle Ages, I'm starting to think that the important issue here depends on where we are currently "stuck" inside the process of Involution, and so that's what things will depend on when it comes to our revolutions against the present. We must always be fighting for Truth, and that means we must not only hearken back to the less degenerated age before us, but we must also know exactly how far we are from that ultimate source of Truth in the first place, and also where we are going to end up in the future. So we'd be aware of all past, present, and future at the same time. I think we touched on this in the introduction thread too. The thing is: where are we, exactly, right now? In this century, are we indeed approaching the "lowest low" in all of history? And if so, could we possibly be on the cusp of reaching a new Golden Age once this current Iron/Dark Age ends? I mean, I honestly can't find any point in the entire history of the whole world (no matter where you look) as spiritually low as this one. Or maybe I'm being too optimistic? After all, one could even consider this type of thinking to be a lazy handwave, like "Oh, we're just living in the Kali Yuga right now, and it's all going to collapse soon, and then a new Golden Age will begin with the coming of Kalki, and it'll be awesome again, so no worries." I mean, a Medieval person could have also believed similar things about how the apocalypse is coming and Jesus is returning and it'll all be awesome. But as we now know, instead of that happening, what has simply happened is that Involution has merrily continued on its destructive path. Hell, what if we are still in the Bronze/Merchant Age? It is the age of capitalism after all. Could that mean that there's a whole further age of darkness (something like global communism) waiting for us once we reach the Iron Age? Is that where the world is going, especially considering the current state of the West and the American Empire? I'm honestly not too sure.
</p>

<p>
	I guess this also brings us back to the topic of Esoteric Hitlerism too, and how he fits into the picture. I'm convinced that Hitler was more than human, and that he really was a spiritual vessel of some sort, but I'm not sure what part of the puzzle he will occupy as things move forward. His quote when he said "I'm not he, but I prepare the way for him" has always spooked me out though. What do you think about that quote, by the way?

			What are your thoughts on the Sufi recording?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I recognized the Arabic chant at the beginning right away, since it's one of the most famous Quran verses, and our teachers used to have us memorize it back in elementary school. Although, this is the first time I've heard it being sung this way. (Fun fact, if you've listened to this recording a lot, you should know that a notable part of the Arabic chant actually talks about you Christians. The chant asks God to keep the Muslim on the path of Islam, and then it talks about how Christians are all lost "in darkness." I've heard that this part actually pisses off Middle Eastern Christians quite a bit, though they can't mention that openly.) But anyway, overall, the recording was pretty good, and I especially liked the structural composition, since it emphasized that it is all one holistic piece. The content was spot-on too, especially the metaphorical parts like the one where she compares the mystical journey of finding God to a stained glass window, where you add all the small pieces together until you see the one complete Truth. Interestingly enough, some of the things she talked about also reminded me of Therese de Lisieux's writings. Are you familiar with her works? She was a French nun, and her conception of Christianity was one of the best lessons I've understood about life in general: that it's all about suffering and self-sacrifice, and doing it willingly out of love (in her case, for Jesus) everyday.
</p>

<p>
	And by the way, I also noticed that the Sufi woman in that recording is actually a Jew. Doesn't that bother you? I have to admit, I realized it halfway while I was listening to the recording, when I just clicked the about page out of curiosity, and I realized she's a Jew. Strange world. (I guess this is more of that strangeness we talked about? Lol.)

<p>
	Man, I should really start reading those Eckhart sermons already, though they're still way down my reading list. But quotes like the one you put there make me start questioning my list, lol. But yeah, I agree. And I'd say that the lack of God in a Dark Order is one of the main reasons why it'd be weaker than something based on the true Cosmic Order. After all, would a communist build a sculpture that no one sees with absolute perfection? Maybe if the state watches them 24/7, but I don't think so. Any idealism is better than materialism, but an idealistic belief that doesn't have any sense of honor or divinity would be much weaker than one would that does.
</p>

<p>
	And also, this tangent can actually take us into another interesting conversation: the notion that the modern state has essentially replaced God. The pinnacle of this type of state would be a Marxist state (or perhaps it would be the modern capitalist states of today) where there is no space for God at all. Which means… that if we take this logic opposite way around, then we'd come to the conclusion that the pinnacle of Godliness would be the non-existence of a state. Not a very fascist conclusion, is it? Or perhaps this is another duality that needs to be reconciled into a trinity. State + no state = Organic State? What would this look like in practice?
</p>

<p>
	Laozi mentions something similar in the Tao Te Ching, where he says: "A leader is best when people barely know that he exists, not so good when people obey and acclaim him, worst when they despise him." (That saying could also be interpreted as a description of Involution too, in a sense.) I'm not too sure about this whole topic though, since we are walking a bit too close to the whole anarchist "abolish the state" mindset, which is the stupidest thing ever. But again, we also have to remember the contradiction between God and the state. "More state" almost always seems to equal "less God."

</blockquote>

<p>
	Alright, I think I see the problem now. The point you made about metaphysics is what really wrapped it up. Basically, remember the thing Wittgenstein said about people not understanding him in the future? That's the problem we have now with Epicurus, except it's a trillion times worse because he was from a completely different world in a completely different era, and he spoke a completely different language from even modern Greek, and to make things worse he talked about complex metaphysical issues. That's a recipe that will lead straight-up lead to tons of misunderstandings. It actually makes me kinda mad now that Epicurus is loved so much by those atheist fedora types. Poor guy. Imagine trying to reach the mystical and telling people about it, and then 2000 years later being "celebrated" as the ancient Greek apostle of fedoraism. (At least one thing that the likes of Hitler and Codreanu can be proud of is that no neckbeard would ever quote them. Lel.) This is yet another reason why the best way to reach God is through initiation centers that don't cater to the masses.

	Tractatus 6.44: "The <em>mystical</em> is not <em>how</em> the world exists, but <em>that</em> it exists." Awesome stuff. Whether we're talking about a Catholic theologian from the Middle Ages like Aquinas, a Jewish philosopher from the 20th century like Wittgenstein, or an ancient Chinese scholar like Laozi, it's amazing how they all basically say the same thing.

<p>
	Isn't that always going to be the case though? I'm pretty sure most of the masses within the NSDAP (especially as it got more popular) were following chauvinism as well, and it was only the likes of Himmler and Rosenberg who were trying to achieve higher Truth. And of course, Hitler was Truth personified, so I'm guessing that the natural structure of a fascist group would always consist of a few Traditionalists at the top with lots of chauvinists at the bottom, right?
</p>

<p>
	By the way, it's funny that I've heard so many people calling Orban a "fascist." And then you have Jobbik who are actual nationalists, and people call them fascists too. But then the Traditionalists, the real tradical fascists, aren't even satisfied with Jobbik.

	Thanks for the links. I just read the first paragraph of the Hamvas article and I can already tell that this is going to be high-quality stuff.

		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Do you mean practically? In that case, if it's done for the sake of greater centralization, I support it, especially in the case of Kurdish. A unified Kurdish dialect is badly needed, because many Kurds across the different parts of Kurdistan can't understand each other at all. Kurdish has three main dialects (each with lots of sub-dialects), and the differences between the main dialects are like the differences between Norwegian, Dutch, and Swedish.
</p>

<p>
	But then if we're talking spiritually, then language reform is really quite dangerous, since it could butcher the language if it's not handled correctly. I suppose, here's how I see it: don't do language reforms unless a) you really very badly need to do so, and b) you know what you're doing.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Totally against it. I'd rather eat fire than allow something like that to happen.
</p>

<p>
	First of all, there's no such thing as "Syria" in the first place. Who is a "Syrian"? It doesn't mean anything, because just like there is no such thing as "Americans," there is also no such thing as "Syrians." So for us Kurds (a real nation) to belong to some federation under a name that doesn't mean anything, and under a people who are history's biggest example of miscegenation and mongrelization… I mean, that's insane. And furthermore, even if Syria was a thing and the Syrians were a real people, the fact is that they're still Arabs. They're Semites. Meanwhile, Kurds are an Iranian people. There is simply no way for us to allow ourselves to be in any sort of permanent unity with Semites, let alone an actual federal structure (which could always risk becoming a national state anyway, so we would never trust their federal promises). Besides, that map is geopolitically impossible anyway. In fact, it's an even bigger pipe dream than even the craziest map that the most chauvinistic Kurdish nationalist could come up with.
</p>

<p>
	As far as the countries in our neighborhood are concerned, we'll have to be in a state of perpetual war with all four of them. There's simply no other choice, or else we won't exist. The Persians have to have Eastern Kurdistan because it's vital to their security interests, and so do the Turks have to have Northern Kurdistan, and they won't give them up without a fight, and afterwards they'll try everything to get them back. So we have to wage war against them. And indeed, one of the biggest problems in Kurdistan is the fact that Southern Kurdistan is allied with Turkey, whereas Northern Kurdistan is allied with Iran. So Kurdistan is split in half, because our geopolitical situation demands us to split in half if we want to get into alliances with our enemies. So no, alliances like these would only harm Kurdistan.
</p>

<p>
	The closest thing to an alliance, maybe, would be something we could do with Greece and the Slavs against the Turks (<a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QoOtr587C64/maxresdefault.jpg" rel="external nofollow">all hail the Greco-Kurdish Empire</a>), whereas on the other side we could have some sort of alliance with the Azeris and Balochis against the Persians. Not much else we could do. Again, I understand your point about chauvinism, but in our case, there's no other choice. The Middle East really needs a big Kurdish war to shake up the place. The countries around us have been insulting and belittling our nation's honor for the past 100 years, and we need to settle scores with them. Now, I'm not sure if you've seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2VeXbqBQBY&amp;t=2m40s" rel="external nofollow">this video</a> yet, but watch it from 2:40 to 3:06, especially when Hitler says: "Otherwise our German folk would be burdened with this blemish for all time." Of course, Hitler was saying that because Germany was forced under foreign occupation for 15 years; now imagine how he would have felt if Germany was forced under foreign occupation for a 100 years. That's exactly how every single Kurd has felt for the entirety of the past century.

<p>
	That's the big hope. A lot of them are already nationalistic, but we need to enhance that nationalism in accordance with Truth, and we also need to eliminate feminism and the other decadent ideologies that these communistic tendencies have spawned. Going back to what we were talking about earlier, I guess we will have to take them up the ladder of Truth, step by step by step. But we can't do it with compromise either: we will have to stand at the final edges of Truth, with no compromise on anything, and then draw them in closer and closer from there.
