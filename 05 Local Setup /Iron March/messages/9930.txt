<p>Hey, I want to apologize; I've been super busy with work and will be until the 30th. I've had very little freetime and what freetime I do have is spent sleeping. I will try my best to reply in full later today (6/26), but until then I have a question that I thought of while reading your reply:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why does one need to morally justify "might makes right"? The question seems to be, largely, irrelevant because you're trying to morally justify a moral principle. In other words, your questions can be rephrased as "why is it right that "might makes right"?" which seems a tad paradoxical don't you think? If anything, this seems like it might fall into the realm of metaethics, but I'm not even sure what metaethicist would attempt to morally justify a moral axiom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In other words, the question seems akin to the question of why is utilitarianism morally justified? The answer will, inevitably, be a tautological statement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
