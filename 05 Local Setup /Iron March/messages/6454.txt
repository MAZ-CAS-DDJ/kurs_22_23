<p>I live in the southern part of the US, but I'm actually a yankee who lived out west for most of my life.</p>

<p> As for my ideology, I really don't claim one. If we can form an identitarian ideology for white Americans, then I would claim that. In a general sense, I would say I'm a Fascist. Though I would like to think my political views are derived from higher spiritual truths, as far as I understand them.</p>
