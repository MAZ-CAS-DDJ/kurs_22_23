<p>I was born in the UK mate. Decendant of the Cetniks that came over in the 40's. I keep in close contact with my people over on the other side though. Im not involved in anything real at the moment though, however I do intend to go over to Serbia for trip and try to get involved over there.</p>
<p>Other than an EDL presence here, there isnt much going on in the way of nationalism around where I live.</p>
<p>Im not that Serb btw. I wasn't on the ITPF.</p>
