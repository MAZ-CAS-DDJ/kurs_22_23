<p>Hey, Jacob.</p>
<p>Well I'm cooking up several things right now. I'm trying to put together a little venture called the Occidental House; which is going, I hope, to serve as an American version of the Flemish House that WiB has spoke of. Slow going so far, as Fasces is the only one close enough who can help. My two other prospectives fell through. I'm also thinking of a journal, though it is a complete departure from <em>Union!</em> as I'm going for more of a National Socialist slant.</p>
<p>On the personal front, things have been going fine. My religious projects are steaming ahead and the holidays are coming up, which is always a good thing. My mother has been going through stuff, but I hope she'll come out fine. As for you yourself, you of course have my sympathies; to use the stale phrase one cannot help but use. But I do congratulate you on your conversion to Orthodoxy. Might I ask what variant? The faith has always been a fascination of mine.</p>
<p>Yours kindly,</p>
<p>Dux</p>
