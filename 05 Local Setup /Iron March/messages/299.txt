<p>Ok, well if you were not previously aware we have a<a href="http://theip.forumotion.com/" rel="external nofollow"> forum</a> here which is where discuss things with my members and share materials for writers. right now I think I have a large enough group of people working on stuff, but I am more than willing to put my end in if anything there provokes any interest. feedback is something I appriciate, particularly the recent ATTACK journals and blog. You also travel in different circles so any information or sources would be appriciated as well.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
