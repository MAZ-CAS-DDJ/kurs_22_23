<p>I'm assuming you're Muslim, and I wanted to ask a question regarding your post in the segregation thread. You said Muslims couldn't have taverns, but isn't a tavern just like an inn/motel? How is this unlawful in Islam and why was it not allowed? Thanks in advance, and sorry for any typos, I'm on a phone and it won't even let me see everything I'm typing here. </p>
