<p>I'm sorry to hear that. I had the same happen when I was 8 years old, it's really bad for the children. Seems very common these days. Your dad sounds like a bit of a cuck faggot, in regards to his views. Mine's the same sadly. I've tried to talk him out of it but there's no talking to them, they've lived their life and can't change their views without invalidating everything they've ever done. It's interesting to see their reasoning behind everything though, on a psychological level. If you're familiar with Dr William Pierce, boomers are almost always exactly like his definition of a lemming. It's amusing and depressing at the same time.</p>

<p>If you're getting into weightlifting that's fantastic. If you wanna gain good muscle or weight in general (if you're a hungry skeleton) you need to make sure to eat well too. Diet counts for 75% or more when it comes to that. I've always been pretty geeky, although participated and enjoyed sports a lot too. Just gotta keep on the path of self improvement in all areas and you'll be an aryan übermensch before you know it.</p>

<p>Germanic is my focus for paganism, much like Hermann. I was raised by my German side of the family, especially my grandparents who were literally nazis and served in the third reich. Other side of the family is English and I disowned most of them. Always felt more German in culture and attitude anyway. When it comes to European paganism, all the underlying views are the exact same, they're just expressed with different names and tales. Comes from the same source. You've just got to follow what's in your blood. Norse and Germanic paganism are nearly identical anyway, they share the same gods, the same culture and the same blood.</p>
