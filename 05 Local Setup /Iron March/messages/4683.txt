<p>Neo-paganism in a nutshell. A "white" community - a place where women have to carry guns to avoid being raped. That is WORSE than South Africa. Lane's character says the girl would "wrongly call it rape." Pretty ironic when you consider white nationalist pagans are always bitching about white women being raped by either niggers or the Red Army. I am confident that if Lane were to live long enough, he would have come to embrace pederasty as well because it's so in touch with the "pagan spirit."</p>
<p>As for your new PM, there is indeed more to it than that. You cannot have the New Testament without the old, this is a good aspect of the Orthodox church, pretty much everything else is shaky with regards to other theological aspects of the Orthodoxy. The Jews as we know them today are not Israelites or even descendents from the tribe of Judah, many of them are Edomites, many of them were descendents of Cain (Kenites). The groups we know them as today went on to split into Sephardim (Edomite descended w/ negroid and mongoloid admixture) and Ashkenazim (Edomite and Kenite descended with Khazar-mongoloid and European input).</p>

<p>Those two links have some good background on them, it helps put everything into perspective a lot more. It's a known fact that "Indo-Euopeans" can trace their ancestry to the Middle East first and then into Europe later.</p>
<p>Here I've discussed the "Jews" some more:</p>

<p>Besides the Israelites were described as Ruddy:</p>

<p>Infact <a href="http://www.htmlbible.com/sacrednamebiblecom/kjvstrongs/STRHEB1.htm#S119" rel="external nofollow">here is what Adam</a> means. It would be silly to give this name if it wasn't a descriptive name.</p>
<p>And Ancient Egyptians depicted them as so:</p>

<p>Modern Jews hardly fit thse descriptions and depictions, they are infact swarthy, kinky haired, rubber lipped, hook nosed, slimy, pathetic looking and they are the biggest mongrels (mamzers) out. Sure there may be SOME religious jews of Israelite stock, but most are not.</p>
