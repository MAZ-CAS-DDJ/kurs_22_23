I would like to ask you something about the Nationalist Movement in Bulgaria. You know the Party ATAKA, right? What kind of Party is it? A genuine fascist one, or conservative far-right like Lepen or something?</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The things are not going well at all.. Now we even change our history books with some new more PC and shits.. You will see it personaly after 10 years if you really pull the short stick...</p>
<p>Well how well do you know the politics here ? They all are same ex-socialist secret police informants thugs, money stealing, EU ass licking, people fucking mostly jews or masonic bastards and oligarchs and so..  Ataka is no different from them . In ideology they are some rusophilic, serb-like, schovinist, orthodox cristian, anti turk and anti muslim movement in some very silly "patriotic" way but that is only a facade they are just like any other party only difference is that they play a "nationalism" card cuz they dont have any chance to take other voters.. Dont take them seriously they have perfect opportunity and blew it.</p>
<p>But if you look other parties like "Bulgarian National Alliance" there is whole different story. They are fine NS movement. They have some problems with legalize own party but have some successes but the ruling elite dont want them in politics cuz if they enter in politics one day will bring all traitors to the wall and shoot them literally. Most of its members are young idealist who using their heads for thinking not only to endure hangover. They are fine nationalist. Ideologicaly they are genuine NS not only left or right, both are go hand to hand (without marxist or liberal shits e.t.c). In other matters they are conservatives but not like russian or serb cons who lived in past ages but try to protect our traditions in 21century. Other than that you know anti gay anti emigrant, anti colonial government (something that you will have soon..) every thing that any self respect nationalist org will do. With 2 words you will be proud to have such movement in GR. We and them have some nice co-works and they are just fine..</p>
