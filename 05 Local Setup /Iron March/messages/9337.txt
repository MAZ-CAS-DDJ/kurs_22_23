<p>What you felt is so normal. It's a core part of masculinity. To see it suppressed so heavily across the West is really disgusting to me. All these little boys love to play fight and talk about violence and death and dismemberment, and that's completely OK. It's natural, it's instinct. But our society considers it a sickness or an evil. The attack on the warrior spirit is an attack on the core part of a man, and it is directly responsible for the despondency and depression that is an overwhelming theme among the men of our age.</p>
<p>I wish I had discovered that I was not alone earlier! 3 times I got kissed by guys who were not white, and I would feel awful and cry, but I didn't know why. Makes perfect sense now. I hate to think how many more young white girls are standing in that spot.</p>
<p>School can be hell once you discover cosmic truth... Sounds nerdy but it was so true! I bet you hate it even more, considering the population <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>I had a dog and a little cat, but they both died. Another soon I hope! And I'm thrilled that you get a native family, how awful it would be to live with kebabs...</p>
