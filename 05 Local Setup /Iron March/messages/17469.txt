	Yeah I think Shia-Sunni unity is important. I dislike salafists and other extreme orthodox muslims usually because they tend to be cosmopolitans except in some rare rare cases. Sufism is really interesting to look into. I think nationalism can work in Islam cause there is a hadith that says love for the motherland is the same as love for the faith.
