<p>Yes, I have heard that Turkey has many different Nationalist ideologies also, but like you said, that is same everywhere.<br /><br />Well, I am also Pan-Uralist, so I would like to see Finland and Estonia with our historical areas who are now under Sweden, Norway and Russia, united as one. Then we should make solution with Komis and Idel-Ural Finns. I think that Idel-Ural should stay as one federation (Turkic/Finnic). In Turan case I prefer Confederation, because we have differences also. Naturally that would give Finns much more opportunities than EU.Â </p>
