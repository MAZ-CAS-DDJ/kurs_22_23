	As salaam alaikum,

	I am now a Muslim and declared my Shahada at my local mosque recently just before Ramadan started, and I have been warmly welcomed by the local Muslims. They treat me well as I am the first white man who has ever joined the local mosque for prayers.

	The Islamic Greenshirts had their Facebook page suspended (surprise, surprise as its owned by Zuckerberg Â *cough * cough!). They also had their Twitter page locked for 24 hours but managed to get it unlocked again, and now their email account has been suspended but they are trying to get it un-suspended.
