<p>I recently read the wikipedia article on French demographics, and I was very suspicious about the increase in birth rates. French birth rates had been in a decline until after World War 2 when the birth rate suddenly rose. According to the Wikipedia sources, increase in birth rates has never been explained. The writer of the article neglected to mention whether the increase is to be attributed to the immigrant population or the French population. Furthermore, many French people are mongrels, mixed with Berbers, Negros, and other swarthy races. The French government promotes the ideology of French miscgeniation as reported by wikipedia. What are thoughts on French demographics? How much is exaggerated?</p>
