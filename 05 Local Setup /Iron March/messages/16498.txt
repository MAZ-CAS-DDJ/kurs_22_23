	For the podcasts, you should listen to mysterium fasces. Me natt and other ironmarch guys are frequent guests. We were also frequent guests on "nationalist review online" and some of those episodes are great. We also did a series called "hanged fools", which you can see, along with mysterium fasces, on ropeculture.com
