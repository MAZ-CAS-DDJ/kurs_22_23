	Whoa Oakleaf you've just gone full teenager who just discovered Nietzsche. <br />
	Just go the hedonism route if you're starting to think like that.<br />
	Come on Oakleaf war is the greatest path to inner peace.<br />
	It worked for Junger and Evola. <br />
	The path to inner peace requires confrontation and struggle so have no idea why you object to fighting.<br />
	Hitler didn't call for a perfect society.<br />
	He called for one that conformed to natural order.<br />
	Humans are inherently sinful creatures so its understandable that they're fucked up. But they can still find salvation my man.<br />
	Again I think you're problem is that you've spent your entire life in America, hence the only people you've come into constant contact with are well Americans.<br />
	Oakleaf I'm being serious when I said you'll need to leave this hellhole and experience the wider world. <br />
	If you still think that there's no hope after that then you can continue ranting to me.
