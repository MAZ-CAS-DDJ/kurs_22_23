<p>When you say Iron youth, is it some sort of division to a bigger movement? I Notice it says ''Youth''</p>
<p>Anyways your posters od Deviantart look Fantastic! What i would have done whit that amount of creative and charismatic posters i would probly not give them out to peopel as flyers, rather i would hang them up at walls and billboards arounde my town/city/village. all of them, 10 of each kind. So many it would be hard to ignore. Then people start searching for ''The Iron youth'' online, then they know who you are, search for you, joins you, and in seconds, you are the Tsr of Greater Russia (ta da!)</p>
<p>Anyways, how do you make these qoutes under your comment? Joined yesterday.</p>
