<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">When you play Mass Effect 3, do not forget to download the Extended Cut DLC, the original endings were very, very bad. They expanded upon them with this DLC.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">Thank you for clearing up the True Blood Nazi part, for the Reich has quite the sentimental value for me. (I guess we all are like that to a certain extent.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">Regarding TV series, I'd recommend Rome and Spartacus, both are excellent series. Especially Rome(get your hands on the Blu Ray version if you can.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">When it comes to games, I'd recommend the following RPGs: The Witcher, The Witcher II - Assassins of Kings, Dragon Age: Origins, Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. Brilliant games, especially the Witcher I &amp; ii.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">The Witcher II is by far in my art category. Great dark fantasy setting, mature themes, political intrigues(the last chapter being solely about politics,) and grey morality. What I love most about it is the fact that it is not a politically correct game. It features slavery, regicide, racism, slaughters(which are graphically depicted at some points,) hell, you can even go to a brothel and choose your whore. It keeps true to the medieval times.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">Some quotes from it:</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">Prince Stennis: "In this world there are crimes that can be forgiven! And crimes that, by any means, cannot! Just as a mother killing her own child or a man slitting his own brother's throat cannot be forgiven. A crime against one anointed by the gods themselves can also not be condoned! He who raises hand against divine right is not worthy to walk this world!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">[...] I am the one you should look to for guidance. Let my deeds be the flame that lights up your darkness."</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen: "I am no warrior sire, I must admit. I prefer to joust verbally or with a pen, the emissary of peace that I am."</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">King Foltest: "Hogwash! You're the emissary of The White Flame Dancing on the Graves of His Foes, the emperor of Nilfgaard, who spared no blood conquering over a dozen sovereign realms."</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen: "Thus bringing them laws, culture and peace above all."</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">King Radovid V the Stern: "Politics is like a complicated puzzle. Every piece may prove useful. Or equally useless, even harmful. A breakthrough awaits us at Loc Muinne, by my hand no less. This will be no second Thanedd. Soon, everyone will learn what the Redanian king is capable of."</span></p>
