I’m just not one for defining my political position in terms of a strategy (i.e. ‘New Right.’) That’s all.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">And while metapolitics <em>is</em> a much needed strategic development for our side; it’s also obvious that it’s an as-of-yet incomplete one. Reasoned analysis may well play a role in somebody’s adopting and/or retaining a worldview; but it would seem that it’s non-rational factors that are more important for actively attracting them to begin with. So I’m not sure how much our movement can be broadened simply by introducing more people to our ideas – albeit well-articulated and well-argued for. There definitely needs to be a concomitant <em>non-rational pull</em> along side/in-front of ENR-style theorising.</span></span></span></p>
