<p>Hello White Man,</p>
<p>I'm wanting to put my money to work, but I don't make much. I've always viewed metals as a good investment especially because I used to scrap for a living. Gold is great but it is expensive and I've always been told if you don't have much money to work with then one ought to invest in silver. Is this a good idea? I've noticed silver has doubled in price over the last 5 years and is relatively cheap. Gold will go up always but it is extremely expensive where it would take a few years to get an ounce of Gold I could get an ounce of Silver in months. If I drop $500 in silver over the next couple of years then in 10 years I could bring in $5000. </p>
<p>I've also had a plan to invest mostly in silver and buy a few grams of gold here and there on the side to add a bit of a cushion of profit. </p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>
