<p>Well, there were two instances where both Don and Sancho are speaking in the same paragraph, where you are supposed to simply begin a new paragraph rather than having two double quotations together in the same space. An example of this is found on page 6.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was going to mention commas being placed outside quotation marks as an issue, but I've since learned that that is just something the Commonwealth does that America doesn't.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are also a few examples of odd word choice or a sentence that just could have been phrased better. An example of odd word choice is found on page 23. "Greatest people came into their own[...]"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This should be either "<strong>The</strong> greatest people[,]" or "<strong>Great</strong> people[.]"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An example of a sentence which could be "streamlined" is found on page 28. "[...]a lot of fascists make a point of how they defend their race..."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A way to make this sentence a bit more fluid would be to cut out the "how they defend their race" and make it "defending their race," and perhaps even putting "race" in single quotations, to further drive home the point made here about modern degenerated fascists believing in the inherent worth of all white people (if that's what was being implied).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, there ya go. Whether you think this is a big enough issue for me to dive into it and mess with some things is up to you.</p>
