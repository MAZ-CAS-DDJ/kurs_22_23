<p>I haven't read any of his books, so whatever opinion I have would be very superficial. I can say this: I find his writing style to be dry and difficult - I prefer a more conversational style myself. Though if you're going to read aggrippa, the 500 year time difference will make it a tough journey too, so yeah...</p>
