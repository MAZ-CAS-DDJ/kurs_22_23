<p>Well, while there is racism epithets usually aren't used in the presence of the other. If the one black guy in the platoon isn't there then Whites, Hispanics, Asians, etc. do tend to pull out the nigger card. Funny how all races can agree that niggers are useless. Not a lot of antisemitism, but many Americans have never even met a Jew much less have an opinion on them. Hispanics tend to be less race conscious so you can call them a beaner to their face, and they'll probably just insult you back. Now that I think about it, blacks and Jews are the only minorities to take offense to racism. Never heard an officer use words like that though, they rarely even curse.</p>
