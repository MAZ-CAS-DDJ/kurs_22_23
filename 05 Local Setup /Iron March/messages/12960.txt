	I worship and pay respects to all the deities by the way I live. I will actively worship specific ones from time to time when I am looking for something specific, such as Odin for wisdom or Thor for willpower, or Tyr for courage. There are several ways to go about it, some people will choose gods to dedicate themselves to, whereas others will believe they are chosen after certain events in their lives. The ones they worship can change many times until they find the one they think is right. It is important to pay respects to all gods though, as they all represent important forces.

	Rune reading is, or was real. The majority of what you'll find on it is total bullshit wiccan nonsense and the people spreading it should be bogged. If you want to read sources about it, you have to read ancient history from the roman days. There's not much else, and the actual methods that were used and how it works is not well recorded or understood. I've never actually tried it myself, but I might some day. Agrippa at least has some writings relating to old magic that is similar. Hermann would be the expert on that, and he has tried rune reading too. I wouldn't say it's the same as the horoscopes. It's more personal and specific rather than general.

	Good luck with all of your papers, just make sure you work on it every day and you'll be fine.
