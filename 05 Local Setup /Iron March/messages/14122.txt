	I do often praise <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> on there but there is a divide between those you think they being deliberately childish and those who understand their media baiting tactics, which means that millions off people see them. SF has its place, but its not to my taste just as <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> isn't to some people. As long as they're in the racialist camp, that's all that matters.
