<p>Yeah, I think Triarii may have denied some stuff your right. As for the others idk but like I said they haven't denied it either and definitely use the aesthetic and militarist themes.  I think in a respectful and honest (non-parody) kind of way imo.  Although, Legionarii may have denied some things but I am not sure. Tbh Von Thronstahl is my favorite.</p>
