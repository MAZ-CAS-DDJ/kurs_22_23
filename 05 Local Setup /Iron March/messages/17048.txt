	All the scripting was done by me. (like 3-4 years ago when i was learning javascript and webgl).

	The assets(3D, images, etc) are from various sites. I had to edit the animations myself (3dsmax) to be consistent.

	Thanks, but there is no need. I plan to keep this as more of a hobby because making money from something like this is somewhat hard in this part of Europe. Also, if i plan to make any games, they will be browser based and the market for these(and work opportunities) is very very small.
