<p>I'm a former atheist and then was a Babylonian pagan at that too, lol (my former username on this forum was Nebuchadnezzar II). Leftists and atheists hate me because I'm used to all of their arguments, know where they're coming from and know their points better than they do as well, the holes in their points and reasoning as well as knowing the bible and it's teachings, far more than they can ever grasp, ironically they always end up falling back on moral arguments when they lose the historical, theological and scientific ones, haha.</p>
