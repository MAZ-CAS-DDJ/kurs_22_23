	I came to Iron March to link-up with the wider movement, because while I have a small group of comrades, our activities can't possibly be of much use without a strong organization.

	I don't expect to be inducted right away, because of security reasons, but I hope that after an extended period of getting to know one-another we could work together, and that my group could make itself useful to the TWP. Many of us are former leftists who use those contacts to gather intelligence on dozens of Communist organizations, sabotage them, and poach their members and turn them into Nationalist informants. This is our most significant project at the moment, that is why I hope you will write back to me, as a project like that can't possibly be of much use in isolation from the wider Nationalist movement.

	Originally I wanted us to link-up with Atomwaffen, but lately I have been more impressed with the TWP than Atomwaffen, which is less professional in comparison.

<p>
	This is why I am pleasantly surprised to see you on Iron March.

	Hail Victory
