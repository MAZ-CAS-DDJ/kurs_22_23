<p>You know, to be honest with you, I don't know if I could adhere to any ideological doctrine completely. All doctrines are going to have their flaws, but from what I'm garnering from this website, Fascism seems a little strong, no? I like the idea about being a zelot for traditionalism, but I don't know about it's anti-democratic stance. How long have you been on this site, and what have you witnessed thus far? Also, is that your general opinion about this site, or do you like it?</p>
