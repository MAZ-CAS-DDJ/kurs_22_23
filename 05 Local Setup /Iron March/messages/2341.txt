<p>The majesty of the Reich far eclipses anything that can be retained; the values &amp; spirit are all that we can inherit. This, is entirely true. </p>
<p>I simply find that Strasserists/so-called 'progressives' destroy that spirit with revisionism of those values. Those values are absolute. </p>
<p>It is true, though, the beauty in the majesty of the Reich is unmatchable insomuch as nothing or no one can ever truly retain that beauty, that atmosphere &amp; the mass incantation of German spirituality we saw. </p>
<p>I weep for the loss of the Reich, sometimes. Very literally.</p>
