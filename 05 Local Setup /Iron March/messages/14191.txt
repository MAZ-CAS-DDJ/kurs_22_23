	Sounds awesome man, I just got myself 2 new rods. Not actually new, but given to me and they're in great condition. I was raised protestant, I grew up with my dads side of the family because my parents split when I was pretty much born. Small town Irish family, so Christianity played a huge role in my life up until about 4 1/2 years ago. I understand religious confusion. Norse Paganism is definitely interesting, even if not religiously but culturally. One of the most interesting periods in time, in my opinion.
