	About Slavros: his understanding of fascism is great, but he doesn't have the spiritual essence to go beyond that understanding. I'll explain it in better detail in the message, but simply put, Slavros is making two big mistakes here. First, he's trying to limit divinity (by limiting our conception of the ideal fascist world with practical concerns, as if practical concerns even matter when we're here thinking about the nature of God and Heaven). And second, he's making excuses for degeneracy (by saying that anything less than the Ideal is allowed to exist, he is inadvertently supporting further and further decline). The real conclusion is this: not only is God the absolute form of fascism, but also in reality only God (only the top of the pyramid) actually exists, and anything lower than God doesn't even exist, because it's just accidental fakery and it's bound in time.

	About the Avatar issue: we both know that the final level (conceptually) of an awakened soul is someone who not only can control himself or control other people, but who can also control animals and inanimate objects and even the spiritual realm as well (i.e. with magic). So the final avatar will indeed bear the full power of the Divine Authority. Also, the avatar isn't just the top of the pyramid but also the <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/26DHprpz3hM52/giphy.gif" rel="external nofollow">center of the wheel.</a> You could say neither of these two things can exist in the material world, but that's like saying that the Apocalypse will never happen and the Last One will never come. Well, as we all know: He will absolutely come, but by that time the material world has been consumed by the spiritual world to the point where God does become material to the fullest point. This is the final conclusion to fascism, and it is subsequently also the goal toward which we must strive while we poor mortals are here trapped in Time, regardless of the circumstances or practical issues, because anything less than this Ideal is just leftism and it would just be making the mistakes I mentioned above: it'd be trying to limit divinity while also trying to make excuses for degeneracy.

	In short: only God truly exists, and everything else is accidental --&gt; therefore, the final avatar will indeed be God fully manifest, including with magical powers and all --&gt; therefore, this is the final and purest conclusion to fascism --&gt; therefore, we must serve this One Ideal regardless of our time-bound circumstances or practical concerns. (We don't matter and we don't exist; only God matters and only God exists. If we even think otherwise, if we even believe otherwise, then we're not fascists.)

	TLDR: our thinking and our living must be APOCALYPTIC, my friend! That is Fascism.
