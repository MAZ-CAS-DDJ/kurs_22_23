<p>Make sure you do everything AHEAD of the deadlines the college/university has posted. Expect admissions to get delayed or to go wrong, and that you'll need to make phone calls/emails/appointments to make sure you get registered on time.<br /><br />As for the financial aid part... I can't be much help there unless you're using the GI Bill.</p>
