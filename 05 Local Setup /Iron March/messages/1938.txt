<p>I missed your posts. Despite our disagreements, I always get a smile when I read your posts.</p>
<p>There were rumors that you weren't coming back. I'm glad that wasn't the case.</p>
<p>Also, do you have Skype?</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>Nah I was just out on business is all. Glad to be back &amp; thanks for the warm words. Some other feller asked me about the Skype not that long ago and I asked my boy to explain it to me but for the life of me I couldn't understand what he was tryin to say. Fact is all this internet mumbo jump is Greek to me. I'll ask him again, see if I can get it squared away.</p>
<p>Thanks for writing. Fascism forward!</p>
