	I'll get a little bit personal with you - I think one of the problems with many Far-Right movements is the travesty of political publicity. I am a very reserved person, and I don't really see the need to advertise my information or knowledge since I am doing my own work for myself and my own group. Frankly, these "movements" on the internet are a fucking joke. All these kids want to grab onto a label and fight for something, so they think posting on forums is a contribution. Most people who are "Right-Wing" are fucking weak. A<strong> real</strong> right-wing man is an athlete, a soldier, a good father and husband, a hard worker, and a worshiper of God. I work everyday, go to the gym right after, and I fund and buy everything myself. I have a stockpile of Military equipment and I plan to train my White brothers into being responsible and strong-willed. We are in a war of information and propaganda in this century. We must educate our white children to be as smart and physically fit as possible. The future is in the hands of the mothers and fathers. We must conquer weakness at its roots.

	Unfortunately, mass change is very difficult in the modern world. This is why I believe in starting small. I am planning on acquiring land, conducting permaculture/farming on it (for semi self-sustainability), raising a big family, and teaching the true Catholic and European values to my children and wife. Everybody should be doing this, <strong>THAT </strong>is making a change - without even firing a shot from a weapon. We cannot rely on a Race War to change things or to fulfill our fantasies. That is what is wrong with movements like this, all these people rely on something that will probably never happen. A true worldview is found in oneself, and should be spread to better our people. Hopefully I will get to meet similar people in real life, so we can make our race better day by day.
