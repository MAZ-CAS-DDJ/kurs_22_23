<p>Ahh, glad to catch you then, since you haven't been on for months. I haunt the same places but this is the only forum I actively post on. I'm definitely not a thousands upon thousands of posts kind of guy, I'm somewhat aloof and kept busy in the real world myself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are a couple of skype chatrooms we have. Very casual and we do calls occasionally, but you obviously don't have to be in the call, you could just do audio if you wanted though.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Heh, yeah, I'm a ZOG-serving Navy sailor. I definitely needed a change from minimum wage slavery and the Navy has been an experience so far. I plan to pick up a trade when I get out, I doubt I would do 20 years of this, bad enough I have to serve the "Empire" for 4 years.</p>

<p>Anyway, pleased to meet you. My name on Skype is Blood and Iron (same avatar), in case you wanted to get on.</p>
