	Many books looks interesting on the outside, but the authors (often from the boomer-generation) doesn't bring faith/theology into context with the subject. All marxist see is own-interests. Like Germans, Japanese and Turks only were together because of own material interests. Almost all books regarding these topics are like that. Of cours something is based on common interests, but one doesn't have a close friend or a wife just to promote one self in this world. Therefor I believe, the cooperation/sharing of world view of National Socialism and the Islamic world truly makes sense.
