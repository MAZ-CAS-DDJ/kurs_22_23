	HAIL BROTHER,<br /><br />
	I meet up with an IRL Montreal group, we have pool parties every few weeks and plan activities like hiking, self defense sessions, etc. Are you an Orthodox Christian by the way? I recently joined the Orthodox Church and love it, as well as the Mysterium Fasces Podcast. Anyway I would have to check with them and vet you somewhat first but give me your info for discord or faceberg and we can chat.<br /><br />
	DEUS VULT!
