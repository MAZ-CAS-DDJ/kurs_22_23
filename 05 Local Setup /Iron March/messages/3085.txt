<p>LÃ¶we,</p>
<p>I should like to invite you, perhaps, to take part in a different community. I have spoken to the Kaiser for a bit, about you. About this forum. About our thoughts. We, in Vanaheim, are a community that normally is involved with...games. But, we are of Prussian Stem. We struggle to mantain such values. Such is our mission. I scan over the internet, for people that might be able to be compatible with us. Maybe you are not much of a gamer, this matters little, for the ideological aspect is there. I do not know, but, perhaps you might feel like dropping by our Mumble, talking to our Kaiser. In the long, long run, we might, neh, we will, help make a difference.</p>
<p>If that is not enough, do listen to

Either way, there is more than meets the...ear. We look for the Elite. Even if you say no, feel free to take this as a compliment.
