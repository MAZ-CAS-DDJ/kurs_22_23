	Haha, yeah, thanks! Just you watch, I'm going to crack this alchemy puzzle from beginning to end. And yup, all hail the Kingdom of God. Imperium really is just the inescapable conclusion to fascism. I never thought Ironmarch would end up teaching me that nationalism by itself is too leftist, but it's true—you were right about that. :D

	First time I've heard Perturbator. I see he has that vapor/retrowave aesthetic. The only vaporwave I'm familiar with so far is 2814. I listen to Rain Temple every now and then. Or, is that too mainstream? Dunno, I haven't dug that deeply into the genre yet.

	Cool! Looking forward to that picture (and dang, I just remembered I should go get a skull mask too). Oh, and by the way, I've gotten back to the US again now, since I'm still continuing my university degree. Also, South/Iraqi Kurdistan is safe anyway lol, and that's the region I'm from.
