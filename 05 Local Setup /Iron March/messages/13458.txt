	Thank you for the offer, and sorry I didn't message you back sooner.  I am interested in getting out from behind the keyboard and doing real work for the cause, but I do have some issues standing in my way currently.  I'm on probation for some drug offenses incurred 2 years ago, and my probation isn't over until next year.  I'm stone sober for two years and getting my life in order, but I'm still without a set of wheels stuck in southern palm beach county.  If you have some people in the Boca or Delray area I'd be glad to meet up, but I really doubt I'll be of any use until i have wheels and johnny law is off my back. Thanks again.
