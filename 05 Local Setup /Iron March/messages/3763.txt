<p>Eh, the only military service in both sides of my family, were limited to grandfathers of both sides. None of their children (or their children) were soldiers.</p>
<p>My granddad on father's side fought japanese in ww2 as a guerilla, later fought in Korea as well, stopped fighting after it and became a family man. On mother's side, my grandfather was in the logistics or on the supply part of the army (postwar, was born too young to face it, 1931). As far as i know, i never heard my parents or adults say "we fought yanks and/or spics", though i wish my ancestors did.</p>
