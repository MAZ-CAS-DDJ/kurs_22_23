<p>I use the term "neo-Fascist" because traditional Fascism as we know it usually requires a national identity. America is in a peculiar situation, in that we're an incredibly fractured, multicultural country, and we can't even define what it means to be an American these days. My idea of Fascism in America could, in some ways, be described as Anarcho-Fascism, in the sense that I think our civilization and system is irredeemably corrupt, and that our best strategy is to try and carve out our own safe zones within it. There won't be any March on DC like there was a March on Rome. I think the American fascist's identity is more in the inherent wildness and pioneer spirit of our land and heritage.</p>
<p>I don't think for a minute that we can vote in Fascism, or do protests to fuel a Fascist movement in the US. I think we need to live as a Fascist man would; strong, violent, martial, and honorable, and to foil degeneracy and liberalism at every turn possible,and forging iron bonds with likeminded men you can trust and rely on when things get rough. That, and to influence art and culture, which is what my job is.</p>
