	An intense start haha I'll do it, don't know if I will can do it for the 12, because I start University the 5th and maybe I'll be occupied these days, but I'll try it (the movie sure, because I'll watch it this night).

	My profile picture is a screenshot of a video (that is in Youtube) of Skydas, a nationalist group (similar to National Action) of Lithuania.

	Renacer Europeo is a so much interesting blog, a pity is just in Spanish. If you have time have a look in Internet of Hogar Social Madrid, the most important patriot group we have nowadays in Spain, is near neo-fascism not at all, but near. They did a manifestation the 21th of May (I went to it) that I think that it coincided with the manifestation of a hungarian patriot group in your country. At the same time I'm collabreting with some Spanish friends, with the tips of some founders of National Action, in creating a national socialist group in Spain.
