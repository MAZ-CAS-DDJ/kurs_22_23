<p>Sadly, I haven't. I had a good buddy who went to Ethiopia and he liked it a lot and said that the poverty in Ethiopia is very different than the poverty in places like India. For instance, in India you can see people so poor you assume they will not live to see the new year, and they are visibly destroyed. But while in Ethiopia there is poverty, of course, the people generally look healthy. </p>

<p>I just wanted to say, I apologize for hooligans in the Baltimore riots, as I told The Colonel, I'm going to not participate in the IM for a while, I'm going to study more and understand about Fascism and tried to create an African version of it.  I'll participate in the site when I become more assertive and actually make progress in my plans.</p>
