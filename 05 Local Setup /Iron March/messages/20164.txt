	Maybe I said it wrong, I mean each race has it's own worldview of the organic state, and it would be impossible for two (or more) races to exist in the same state theoretically. Consider Canada/America for example, Indians would be separated from the white "organic state" as they are the dominating force. (if not potentially genocided or turned into the untermensch class). Because of this the white organic state would interfere with the Indian organic state. The Indians would endlessly rebel against the whites, as would whites if the roles were reversed.

	This whole situation feels like the "strongest" of every race coming together in a temporary truce to cleanse the weak, only to turn on each-other after it's "finished"....

	I am going to keep reading, and maybe I will correct myself, but it started lingering in my mind and I wanted to get it out.
