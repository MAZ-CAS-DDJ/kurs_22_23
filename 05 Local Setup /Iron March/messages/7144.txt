<p>I got charges in Texas they put out a warrant for now, but I'll just avoid Texas and this state refuses to send me there, least now. I'm needing to come up with a good list of reasons I can leave America and not have to worry about being sent back for. I'll backpack Europe at this point, shit IDC I'm already homeless.<br /><br />They had me on deadly weapon and drug possesion charges but just let me out of jail 3 days later. I thought it was like 5 years in jail for a few days myself too.</p>
