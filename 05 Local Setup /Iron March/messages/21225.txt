	True. It's kinda difficult here though, as our vaguely formulated anti-hate law is part of criminal law. So basically offending any group for whatever reason is a criminal offence (ffs). Difficult waters to navigate. We'll probably try to get some pointers from NRM as well, as they have managed to wriggle around Swedish law somehow.

	It's still in a preliminary, information gathering phase of course. And I'm also in the process of setting up a business so I can't get fired for stupid reasons (so don't expect a Stickerocaust™ next week, just sayin').
