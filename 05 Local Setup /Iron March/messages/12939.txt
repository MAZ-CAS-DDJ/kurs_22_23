	That's actually perfect since it conveys your style and that should indeed be reflected in the cover. So it's perfect for this specific article, for the cover designer job there'd have to be stylistic variety however, we can't have them all be vaporwave/80s aesthetics themed. Some notes about this specific design however:
</p>

<ul><li>
		the big posters are supposed to be 1000 by 1500 pixels so this is too small.
	</li>
	<li>
		I'd make the NOOSE logo smaller and the bit where it overlaps the tear could be made to look like the tear covers up that part of the NOOSE log.
	</li>
	<li>
		Seems like your logo is a cut out from a different image, I can see the cut pixelation on it. I'd also make it not touche the white borders.
	</li>
</ul><p>
	I can actually make a Ps shape of your logo and then you can have it any size you want, like a vector.
