	1. Yes, I see but I don't know why. This Russia vs. Ukraine thing is a false bullshit. These guys was able to live together for hundreds of years and they share history. I don't say they are the same, because Hungarians are not the same as Szeklers, or Romanians are not the same as Moldovans, but it is laughable how easy is to create a war between old brothers. And what are they fighting for? Some regions which was a part of Russia and was given to Ukraine by some commies? They are killing their brothers and in the end none of their governments became less corrupt, but they will end up with a bankrupt Ukraine, a weaker Russia and a hatred against each other for the following generations which will make their situation even worse. This whole mess is another move of the NATO to finish off its old enemy, and I know that Russia is not a paradise, but I think we agree on that it's not a hyperliberal, feminist, faggot shithole like the West is.

	2. What's wrong with Empires? I mean, of course, modern empires are only strengthening their degeneracy, but for me it looks like that Russia was able to stop the Westernization (Modernization) and it is slowly going back to Orthodoxy and stuff. That could be a political PR of course, but even if it is, that means that the Russian population is more traditional than the Western one. We are helpless without an Empire, so one way or another we shall have one, and neither the Intermarium or the V4+, or even the European Union would be powerful enough to compete with the USA or China.

	3. I don't know what is the situation in Bulgaria, but I have never seen Russians here behaving like kingz of the world. Every brand is in English, the youth are using American slang, in the schools everybody watches the fucking 9fag etc. We are under Americanization, and believe me, I would be against Russification also, but I have never seen that.
