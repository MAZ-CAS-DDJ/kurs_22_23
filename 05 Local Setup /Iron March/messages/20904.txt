	Gd m8, I am in amidst my national service in a frontier island in the Aegean, and so im a bit disconnected in a literal and metaphorical sense. So things happen and i don't even realize that they happened and that sucks a bit, but also is good in a sense of finding your mind sound if you get me. How's things with you?
