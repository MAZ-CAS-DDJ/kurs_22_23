<p>Yes of course, but we will reclaim territories that we have held as "ours". We will reclaim territories where our people actually exist(Karabagh, East Turkestan, amongst many). Our forefathers had the idea of "nizam-ı Alem", bringing justice to the realms, however we have seen that neither our justice nor our presence is welcome, not even amongst our co-religionists.</p>
<p>150 years from now on, Arabia will be nothing more than a piece of worthless desert. I'd rather have an ethincally homogenous country.</p>

<p>Alright, do you at least support a Caliphate of some sort, for all Muslims, in the ME.</p>

<p>Well, I would if it could stop the resurgence of groups like ISIS, however in Islam, the role of the Caliph is more than just the role of a religious leader, like the Pope in Catholic Christianity.</p>
<p>The powers and purpose of a Caliph must be properly outlined by a multinational meeting of Muslim leaders, and a seat must be chosen for the Caliph from where he can exercise his rule.</p>
