	Silesia :) <br /><br />
	I have a friend who knows a lot of people from the football team Slask Wroclaw. <br /><br />
	I don't to 100% understand identity in your region. You identify with Poland but also have a regional identity? I once met a guy from Silesia who got angry because I called him Polish - he claimed to be Silesian and not Polish. :D <br /><br />
	Can you explain mate :) <br /><br />
