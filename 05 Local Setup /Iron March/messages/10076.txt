<p>I've been trying to contact you via text, facebook, hopefully here will work. I am so worried for you. Please be safe.</p>
<p>I got the calls but the first one asked for my credit card number and timed out before I finished. The second I was in the subway and couldn't get a reception. Again, I really hope you are ok.</p>
<p>Let me know. I love you.</p>
