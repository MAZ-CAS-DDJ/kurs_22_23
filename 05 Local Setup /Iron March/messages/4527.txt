<p>I don't consider myself a racist, though I do consider myself a race realist, in the sense that I oppose multiculturalism. Anders Breivik's manifesto outlines things pretty well. Also, Mussolini's "Doctrine of Fascism" explains things pretty perfectly too.</p>
<p>For me, my grandfather was a Jew. I'm in a relationship with a woman who's half-White/half-Asian. I have a Samoan brother in law. But I support White Nationalists when they're more about love of their own people than about hate of others. The WN's who spend all day thinking up Jewish conspiracy theories or whining about being victims are pathetic to me; they're no different than welfare-sucking ghetto trash who think the white man made them fat and unemployable. The WN's who instead work out, train themselves, raise good families, and frustrate the establishment, I get along with for the most part, even if I don't share the same "<em>muh white purity!!</em>" cause as them. Matthew Heimbach for example is a white nationalist I sympathize with. Even though I'm not a Southerner, I would defend him when the liberals try to slander him.</p>
