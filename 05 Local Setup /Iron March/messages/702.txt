This sounds mostly in agreement with what I believe, although I favour a somewhat stronger and more central (corporate) state-- I'm trying to find a balance between the benefits of centralism and decentralism, and distributism is helping me in that regard. I definitely think that suggesting people leave is a much better way to deal with dissidence than the simple method of execution that most dictatorships have tried.</p>
