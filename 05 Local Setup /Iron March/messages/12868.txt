	Speaking of graphics, what's your skill level with graphic design? I'm looking for someone to replace me in producing covers for NOOSE to lighten the load for myself. You can browse the front page of the website to see what style we're going for. Alternatively browse <a href="http://sputnikipogrom.com/" rel="external nofollow">http://sputnikipogrom.com/</a> to see what served as part of our inspiration for NOOSE to see what kind of cover styles we're ultimately striving for but, obviously, with our own spin on it.
