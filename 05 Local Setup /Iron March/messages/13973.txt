	Know how that feeling. Main problem is just tryna get in contact with people. So many people are skitso about adding unknown nationalists on Facebook, which is the way we need to do it for now, at least with the Brisbane chapter, so we can get a clear picture of who they are. And honestly man if you have that many people in Melbourne, go for it. Not only would it be great for Melbourne, it would help all the other chapters with getting members if we are able to say we have more people nationally, right now in Brisbane were restricted to about 5 people I think, our main focus just being looking for like minded cunts
