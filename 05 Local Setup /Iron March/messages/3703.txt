<p>Yep, you hit the nail right on the head with your observations about white nationalism. It is zionist to the bone. Imitating this degenerate talmudic yankee invented crap is a bad idea for any real nationalist, be he European, Asian or whatever else. Regarding religion, I think adding a crescent is far better than removing the cross. Nationalism needs to promote religion and spirituality to counter the destructive materialism of our modern world. Besides this, Christians (at least Catholics and Orthodox; most Protestants seem highly corrupted and judaized) and Muslims share the same god, similar values and ideals and above all the same enemy - the Jew. Christian-Islamic cooperation is definitely needed.</p>
<p>Marcos seems like a decent guy. I'm not surprised that the German National Socialists respected Filipinos, they were generally friendly to the Asians. The real National Socialists weren't white supremacists or similar minded retards. The real racists in WW2 were the Allies. This is why it sickens me when daviddukeoid stormfrontoid WNoid pieces of shit use Third Reich-imagery to promote their bullshit. Adolf Hitler was an admirable man of prime nobility, the Swastika is a sacred symbol of life and light - how can you defame them by connecting them to something as despicable as white zionism? The Third Reich wasn't perfect of course, far from it, but it was built on the right principles.</p>
<p>The background music of the Frente Nasyonal-video is pretty cool by the way. Is it traditional Filipino music? It reminds me a bit of Javanese gamelan, just more rhythmic and militaristic sounding.</p>
