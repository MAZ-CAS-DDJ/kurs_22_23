	Ok, I was just kidding. The idea of uniting is of course a welcome one. Yes, there are still resentments and chauvinism on both sides, because of geographical and historical reasons. Examples are many: "Wilno nashe", as you have mentioned or the acts of discrimination against Polish minority in Lithuania. However, there were also times when we kicked some ass together. Nowadays we should focus on fighting against the common enemies and not against one another, because that's what the jew want.
