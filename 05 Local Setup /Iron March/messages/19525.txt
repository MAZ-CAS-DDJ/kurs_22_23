	Oakleaf you're such a meanie man.<br />
	But I admit I have my doubts too.<br />
	I thought Atomwaffen was based like <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>.<br />
	But then Weissewolfe happened, Atomwaffen was banned for a while and then they returned like nothing happened.<br />
	Also seeing Ben not doing much after <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> got banned is also pretty concerning.<br />
	Only active groups I see now that aren't facing internal problems are the East Euro ones.<br />
	Maybe I should become a Slavaboo :(
