<p>Cheers for the videos, I had no idea the impact was so profound to the asian community that it actually made them pack their shit up, I was just in Perth overnight for a metal gig, American band named 'Sleep' and the city seems gone, every corner a squat asian, man I don't know how you stay sane working in there and healthy, to boot, they all look like bird flu carrying mongols, man I saw some harsh faces, when the time comes in Australia, the enemy won't look to far beyond the commies in that Horst Wessel movie from 30's Germany, when the time comes that revolutionary politics are needed, our enemy will be well and truly strong and filled in ranks with these red Chinese,  visited freo too, tore down a few red/Marxist posters, that place would be rife for some good old NA style ambush, being a uni town, saw some bums that turned out to be uni students, notre dame too? Catholic reds? I wouldn't be surprised if there were Jesuits hidden up in there ranks. </p>
<p>I joined Australia First a couple years back my activism only spread to putting flyers in letterbox's and stickers at pubs, a nationalist party from NSW, with shoddy aesthetics in an almost all white town made up of 70% old folks, can't say it had any impact. They'll head the same way early labor did without a coherent NS worldview, shrouded in Australiana and as stalwart mentioned to me, over east there name has been slandered that much that it's probably a bit of a pox on nationalism, can't fault saleams integral nationalism essay, I plan on printing that one out as an iron marcher suggested, and spreading it about albs. Cheers for the link, I think I will grab a copy off amazon, PDF or write it out, if I think it's worthy of so, would be nice seeing an Aussie section in the fascist archive, want to do the same for Campbell's book, if I can find it. I'd like to expound on the potential in mining to recruit nationalists, majority white and patriotic but very well off, to the point that it's hard to get them to understand there is something wrong..</p>
