	Thanks a lot m88, I am done with the first two, just listening the third one and interested in the others as well. I know Peste Noire, and Burzum of course. :) Are you familiar with <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xp2xkb_de-silence-et-d-ombre-nihilia-2010_music" rel="external nofollow">De Silence et d'Ombre</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh__tCjBPnM" rel="external nofollow">Arckanum</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZREq4RQbgu4" rel="external nofollow">Darkspace</a>?

	How well do you know Kardecism? The American continent is full with strange religious phenomena; have you heard about the cult of Santa Muerte for example? Also, what do you think about the old Integralist Movement of Brazil?
