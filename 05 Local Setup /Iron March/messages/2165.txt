<p><em>Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia</em> (AUC)</p>
<p>United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia</p>
<p>Now demobilized far-right paramilitary organization in Colombia with a tendency to kill communists, blacks, and Indians. I put it as my avatar because his bandana happens to bear the insignia of my old unit, the U.S. 82nd Airborne.</p>
