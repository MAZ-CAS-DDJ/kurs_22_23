	I don't read many books so no I read some stuff on the starwars.wiki some of the backstory the writers made was cool like the ancient Sith pretty much based on fascism and ancient egypt . I don't care much for the expanded universe except for some of the cool stuff they made about the history of starwars. It doesn't really matter Disney bought it but you can still like and not like what you want about Starwars. So I'm not autisticÂ
