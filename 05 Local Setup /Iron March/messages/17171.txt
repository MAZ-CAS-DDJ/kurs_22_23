	Fuck that, Protestantism is the vilest cancer. I think both Catholics and Orthodoxes are criticizing each other because they see the other as more closer to Protestantism than themselves. That's good, it makes us aware of our potential mistakes.

	Yes, I just read an article here about the ideology of Ernst Niekisch and it's much better than what I expected it to be. First I thought he is just an other Strasser or something. Nonetheless, most IM members are skeptic about Russia, and I have to tell you that today it is obvious for me that back then my views on Russia were overly idealistic. As far as I know they have the same shitty demographics (or worse?) and Putin is almost the same as Orbán; a simple Pragmatist. That's still better than the Satanist Westerners though.

			Kosovo was one of the oldest lands of Serbia, no wonder it is, together with Macedonia, called Old Serbia. Plus it is our literal holy land from which we have been in a way exterminated. It's not hard to imagine our soldiers on that land soon and our churches and monasteries free.

	I totally support that, but this goes against what you have said earlier, and I really can't see how are you going to take it back. You have the power, but Geopolitics is another question. Btw, I thought that today's Macedonians are more closer to Bulgarians. What is your stance on that? I know that Macedonia was ruled by both Serbia and Bulgaria after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, but I read somewhere that their language is almost the same as Bulgarian.
