	I know I'm not really in a place to discuss this, but Николајевић has been a concerning figure in the forum in the past few months. His worrying obsession and worship of school-shooters reminds me of another disgraced ex-Black Corps member, and many other older users of the forum seem quite concerned with his beliefs.

	I would assume that a member attempting to rationalise child rape and worshipping child rapists would be banned, so its quite troubling to see a Moderator attempting to rationalise child murder and worshipping child murderers. This also appears reminiscent of the recent Islamic edge lords, some of whom have been banned.

	These beliefs seem to have come about due to his interpretation of Siege. While Mason wrote of the small minority of fascists taking POWER over the lemming population, Николајевић seems to take this as a small minority of fascists MASSACRING the lemming population.

	His continual preaching of mass killing of lemmings seemingly ties in with the low quality cancer threads and newcomers (the cancer-meme threads were fortunately dealt with, thank goodness). However, I believe that this hardcore psychopathic and nihilistic attitude, which has spread through the easily-influenced newcomers, is scaring away legitimate and "real life" individuals from Ironmarch, which is very unfortunate. His criticisms of <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> and NRM also tie into this, as he seems to dislike any group which attempt to recruit new members from the civilian population.

	I'm not asking for him to be banned and I know my power is very limited, but I would like to hear your opinion on his beliefs. Apologies if I've misinterpreted his opinions but his beliefs have been worrying many other members, as well as myself.
