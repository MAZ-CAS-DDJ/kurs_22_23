<p>Breastfeed-breastfeed-breastfeed! It's the best for kids. If you have your own washer and dryer, do yourself a favor and cloth diaper. It's a top heavy investment, but you'll save thousands. If you need any help with set ups in the future my wife is the go to person. She's the expert. </p>

<p>Also, IGNORE the nurses when the time comes. They will push forumla they will lie to you about circumcision. They will do all sorts of jewy shit to mess you up. If your newborn is crying he's hungry or be held. Do both.</p>

<p>We had numerous lying/apathetic nurses. We had to work around their bullshit. Thankfully we had a few good ones though. A very helpful Portuguese woman who knew right from wrong. We made fun of Indian women for being weak and getting c-sections. </p>

<p>When I heard the news it made my day. I love seeing more people getting together that will do right for their kids and our people. Enjoy guys! </p>
