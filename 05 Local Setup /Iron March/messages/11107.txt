<p>Anytime. I meant every word. If you ever have a problem just send me a PM. By the way I wanted to let you know that I am <strong>NOT</strong> gay, it occurred to me that you might misinterpret my message. I just meant that when you need a friend, I'm here. Please let me know if you get this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PS I promise this will be the last PM for a good while.</p>
