	I dunno.<br />
	When I first came here I was into the tradCatholic shit.<br />
	Now I've found myself reading more about Buddhism and Shintoism. <br />
	With some Hitler Kalkism on the side.<br />
	Not sure if this is mere nationastates larping, but I think every race has some sort of racial consciousness or spirit.<br />
	Hitler was an Avatar of Wotan, the racial spirit of the Germans.<br />
	The Italians would have their own spirit as well, not sure if it would be Mars or Dionysus.<br />
	The Japanese too have a racial spirit in Amaterasu. <br />
	I've started researching on what characteristics Asian fascism would have and the most I've got so far is that it'll be concerned with Buddhism.
