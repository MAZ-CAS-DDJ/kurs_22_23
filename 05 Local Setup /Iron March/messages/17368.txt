	Sure, I probably mentioned sometime within the time of my being in the group I had only been redpilled for two months or somewhere around that and in short, I don't know what came over me but I freaked out that and just started blocking everyone in the group. I regretted it immediately, but I've manned up quite a but since then. Just want a second chance of sorts now.

	I just didn't want to appear racist to my peers, no one knew about my beliefs at that time and I pussied out, can't explain it beyond that.

	If you can't take a second chance, I understand 'course, but I'm stronger now and moved past newly redpilled stage into wanting action.
