<p>That depends on what kind of "National-Syndicalism" we're talking about. On this website we published an article that promotes <a href="http://national-revolutionary.blogspot.nl/2012/02/concept-of-national-syndicalism.html" rel="external nofollow">a nationalist and revolutionary-syndicalist view on National-Syndicalism</a>.  But this does not have much in common with the National-Syndicalism of Spain and Portugal which was based on a more corporatist model. When I have some time I will probably write some more on the subject of syndicalism and its connection with revolutionary fascism.</p>
