<p>Yes, you have to be 21. Luckily it is not hard to get around this if you have friends who are of age, but I don't drink much. I am agreed with you on that opinion! Not great for the kids xD Nothing wrong with it in moderation though!<br /><br />Yes! I have told you I live by the shore, there are oil docks where ships come in and these are great to dive off <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> And your summer sounds very good if you ask me! How long have you boxed?<br /><br />Well, I have started a little! Hvala, Zbogom, little words and phrases. Can <em>u </em>mean 'to' and 'in'? Also, I said I would send a video of the Pacific North-Western accent. Here is<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TuQ2WFv2dA" rel="external nofollow"> one</a> (skip to 1:40), and<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJeeyBTyEOM" rel="external nofollow"> another</a>. This is not my voice though, people here say I have an accent. But my voice is a similar. What is a Slovene accent?<br /><br />Hmm... well, I was raised around the area of a big degenerate city (It's Seattle, do you know it?). And my father, and his family, were very conservative. So I just got more and more extreme, I guess. Got pushed by the world around me, because of being constantly disgusted by it. We would watch videos about fascist nations in school and it was upposed to be scary, but I found it exciting. Then I got to the internet, and found out that other people think like this too. Then I read Codreanu, then I found nationalist/fascist tumblr users, then Ironmarch.Â  Well, that is the short version. How did you come to this ideology?</p>
