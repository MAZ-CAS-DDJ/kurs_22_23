<p>Any working-class neighborhood is a problem in Obongo's Murrica.  Basically, what I think it comes down to is the gentrified, somewhat wealthy, urban Democrats and their mobs vs. the vast rural and suburbs in the center of the country.  I think the voting map bears that out.  I don't sympathize with either party though.  If white people can live somewhere safe, the best bet is in the rural areas with no casinos and urban culture to attract the wrong element so to speak.</p>
