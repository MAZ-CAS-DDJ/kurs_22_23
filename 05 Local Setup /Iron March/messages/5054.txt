<p>Cheers. Its ok, I have been perpetually saying 'it will be next week' for months. Just to confirm, i will be able to see the changes? i have had to alter a few, very minor things here and there, so being able to work off your feedback as a reference would be great. I gave you a pdf which some programmes can comment on but I assume you founf a solution to not being able to directly edit the text. I appreiciate all your hard work.</p>
