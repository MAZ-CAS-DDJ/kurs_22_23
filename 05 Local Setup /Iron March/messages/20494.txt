	To elaborate on the question you stated fascism and islam are natural allies. Salafism wahhabism whatever you want to call it is very puritan in a sense and I can see your point but from my understanding they aren't racialist and are more than willing in launching jihad against the West. There was also the whole incident with AW. So do you think salafism is well suited for the islamic world and its doctrine makes it the natural ally of fascism and what are your thoughts on salafism in the West?
