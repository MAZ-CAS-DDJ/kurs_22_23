	Feel free to ask me questions whenever, I'm happy to answer as best as I can. You did ask me if I was a pagan, and I said that I am, but generally don't consider myself as one. I think it's hard to call yourself one when it really is a dead religion, as in it's not really practiced, and most people who call themselves pagan are not. I suppose Christianity is no different there though, as most people who consider themselves Christian do not follow their religion. I'm drawn closer to paganism than to Christianity but hold a great deal of respect to both of them. Modern Christianity is a plague however.
