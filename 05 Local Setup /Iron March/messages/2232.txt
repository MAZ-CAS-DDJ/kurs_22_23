<p>You didn't insult me, you grasped at straws to try and attack me. Fascism is about one party ruling(this is one of the core points of Fascism, our views above all), not about a little fapping fest of different views. It's not a belief, it's a fact that minorities being accepted breeds their culture into the mainstream, and it's historical for Europeans(like myself, I have no idea what you are), to fight off the decay of homosexuality(Inb4hurrRomanempire. That was only in the upper classes, and even then they were killed many times over it). They aren't inappropriate, they are quite appropriate in fact, at this time there must be no tolerance at all, no second chances, we are at a turning point of victory, it'll be either us(traditionalists) or them(liberals). Homosexuality, which has some points to being genetic, must be stamped out of existence, along with paedophilia, which you have both of those genes in you.</p>
