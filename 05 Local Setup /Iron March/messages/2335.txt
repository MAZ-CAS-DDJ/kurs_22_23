<p>Make sure to look up information on the Falange. I personally translated a few documents that are available here in the Falangism section. It's very absolutist regarding the authority of the State but also leaves room for a measure of freedom at the personal level. It's an ideology that has been discussed intensely among us North Americans. If you have Skype you can hit me up.</p>
