<p>The man I worked with in A3P left due to inactivity on their part. I have nothing against A3P personally, I personally like Kevin McDonald and the rest are just kind of... there. Go ahead and work with them, try to put an edge on them and get them active. We need to infiltrate these types of groups.</p>
