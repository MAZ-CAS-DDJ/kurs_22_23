	I forgot about that, VICE news did a very great report on the private Militias forming in Poland. Unbiased compared to their other videos haha. Where in Poland did you live? I never got the chance to grow up and in live in Poland but my mom is from Lodz and my dad from Gdansk. I'm going to be studying Russian in Russia next summer and will hopefully visit Warsaw too. Who else have you been talking to about this Paramilitary? The fact that you have already got some American and Polish members on board is amazing.
