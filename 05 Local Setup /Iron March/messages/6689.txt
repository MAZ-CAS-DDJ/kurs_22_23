<p>Hey, so I imagine you've heard of Fr. Raphael Johnson, and I'm wondering what you think of him.</p>
<p>Also, Im wondering where you arrived at the conclusion that Christ was aryan, is it the british israeli/christian identity concept?</p>

<p>Hello Panzertanz,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have listened to him on 'Orthodox Nationalist' and read some of his articles over the years, he's been a good spiritual help to me, and his shows on Orthodoxy and the Third Reich were very informative, even reassuring. I think he's regular World Orthodoxy, but I have a feeling he's sympathetic to the so-called 'Old Calendar' Orthodox, as am I.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On your second question, I base my idea of Christ's Aryan-ness on a number of things, including and especially Old Testament Messianic prophesies that speak of his 'fairness', etc.... Also, my personal concept of biology is that of De-Evolution and degeneration. The First Adam was created perfect and godlike, the White race is the most perfect and godlike, the root stock from which other peoples fell further and further from the ideal, and so forth. Well, Christ being the 'Second Adam' Who came to restore the Human Integrity of the First Adam, stands to reason Incarnate God would be absolutely perfect without question. Then we have the Image-made-without-hands, the 'Mandylion' which the West knows as the 'Ovieto Veil' and the 'Shroud of Turin', stolen from the Orthodox Roman Empire after the sack of Constantinople by the 4th Crusade in 1204 AD. The Man on that Image is White, dead and badly maimed and bloody, but Perfect.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'll say it again, unpopular as it may be, but Christ Is White, and to hate Him and deny Him and His Godhood is in truth to hate the White Race. Whites who are anti-christian are self-hating whites or jews, and whatever they do without Him ends in failure. I'm not 'Christian Identity' except in the sense that the migration of the Lost Tribes of Israel took them to around the area of the Volga River, and they became the Scythian tribes described by the Greeks, who called the Scythians the 'youngest people in the World'. Scripture has many prophesies concerning Israel that only make sense in the context of that happening, according to my research. The Indo-European speaking Aryans came from Israel, from Abraham, and ultimately from Shem, and the so-called 'semitic languages' are mis-named and it's well-known these languages are related to the Hametic language group. The non-Indo-european speaking caucasians of the world came from Japeth, and prophesy says 'they shall dwell in the tents of Shem, and Canaan shall be his slave' and be blessed by association with Shem's folk. From Ham come most of the world's nonwhites, with some admixture with Japeth's and Shem's descendants.</p>
