			I think the break up of the United States would probably be a good thing for Americans, not every state of course but states like California could focus on their own problems. I mean, no one back then had a solution to the depression that didn't involve something extremely radical, like the ideas of Huey Long and Father Coughlin.Â <br /><br />
			Silicon Valley must be a pain if you hate pop-culture, my dad says it was one of the most boring places he has ever been too.

	I don't think every state could stand on its own, we didn't build them as big as Canadian provinces. But some can. California, Texas, they're internally divided enough to be like several states. Others would have to be grouped into regions, like Washington and Oregon for Cascadia.<br /><br />
	I'm a bit north of Silicon Valley, we get their tech-industry backdraft but they're about 2 hours south of here. It's not a majorly pop culture-heavy place, not like SoCal. But it is kind of boring to me, definitely not the kind of environment I want to be in long-term. It doesn't feel like "home."
