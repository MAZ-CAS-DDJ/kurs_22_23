	Well shit I don't think anything's going to happen here anytime soon. The political situation is still cucked between Libs and Labor, with fuck all else. Its not like there is much tension here or anything, but then again I don't even follow Aussie politics since they are boring as fuck so what would I know. We are probably like 10-20 years behind the US and Europe.
