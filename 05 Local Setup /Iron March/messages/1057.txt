<p>I'm White. I'm pro-White. Not a White Nationalist though, and I'll explain.</p>
<p>Although I'm a racialist, it isn't a driving factor. Nationalism for me, in particular Americanism, trumps the issues of the wider White race. Although I'm naturally sympathetic towards the plight of the various White peoples (I include Slavs in 'White' which makes me oppose Hitlerism, I accept the reality of a sizable White Jewish community, which puts me at odds with Evola-ist conspiracy-oriented nationalism, and I accept White Hispanics as legitimate Euro-descendants, as good as those of North American origin, which puts me in direct and open conflict with Nordicism), the success of my nation is first and foremost. The existence of minorities in America is part of our tradition and therefore the non-threatening, deserving ones ought to be allowed in place, while those who have overstayed their welcome must go. Children must be educated to avoid miscegenation, not as a matter of purity or other such mythical nonsense, but as a matter of preserving their heritage, lineage, and culture. This would be important for Whites and non-Whites alike, as all our cultures are equally threatened.</p>
<p>My main enemy is not 'the Jews' or 'the capitalists' or 'the communists' but internationalists of all stripes. There are good Jews and bad Jews, there are good Whites and there are race traitors, there are decent capitalists and there are vultures, there are nationalist communists and there are globalist communists. Generalization is the enemy of understanding. The enemy of the nationalist isn't any particular generalized group, but the antinationalist (globalists, internationalists) forces operating across the world, amongst all races.</p>
