<p>I'm a big fan of Ramiro Ledesma's work. I translated some of his writings in the IM Falangism section. I've meant to do more but translating the writings of an obscure fascist intellectual with absolutely no basis to go on takes a long time, and I'm kept pretty busy. I don't recall exactly why Ledesma left the Party, but the information is out there. Lots of intellectuals left fascist parties as the parties move from idealism to practicality in the late 1930's.</p>

<p>And yes, that's a book. Pretty good find. I might get it myself.</p>
