<p>Someone asked me to intro. myself when I've already mentioned my ideology on my profile as Aryanist. Now tell me what more introduction does one need when the word encompasses everything that you said is like "preaching to the choir"... How many diff. kinds of Aryanist ideologies are out there!!!</p>
<p>If I wanted to provoke, would have started trashing the place with innane posts. But I'm a serious person. The reason I stumbled on this forum was because of this thread:</p>
<p><iframe src="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/2360-nietzschean-snobbery-paganism-and-leftism/page__st__20&amp;do=embed" frameborder="0" data-embedcontent=""></iframe></p>
<p>It made me wonder how paganism and communism could be made to fit in one breadth under Nietzschean snobbery, that last bastion of a philosopher who stood against everything and anything to with the degrading semitic infection, including anti-semitism. </p>
<p>I did a search on this forum for topics related to Feminization and found nothing, and so decided I'd post some write-ups by a friend, whose essay is a must read, offering the most comprehensive view of our f---ked up situation...gradually when time permitted. </p>
<p>I'm not a Troll. And I do enjoy learning from the resources on your site. </p>
<p>Don;t be too hasty.</p>
<p>Upto you. </p>
