<p>I took a break for similar reasons. Needed to "find myself" ideologocally and the rampant racists and reactionary types here were swinging me in a direction I didn't quite feel comfortable with. The way they can get away with the overt racial stuff is because most of the admins and mods are just as guilty and support it. I wish they would stick to the first charter where it explicitly says no Nazism, White Supremacy,  or racism.</p>
