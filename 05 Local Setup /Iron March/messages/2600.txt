<p>Socialism is property being shared by the community. A socialist state needs to impalements economic programs, eugenicic/social Darwinian policies, social programs to engineer the new man and expand the military. Industry thats private needs to bend over for the state. State capitalism is a step towards state socialism. 5 year plans need to be implemented over time.</p>

<p>The problem with modern socialism is it has been corrupted by Marxism, liberalism and humanism. Socialism can only truly thrive if humanism is eviscerated. Despite what the majority of socialists(and humans in general) say true compassion is not giving the weak valuable resources, true compassion is letting the weak die they can not drug the strong down to their level.</p>
<p>The NPD appear to be very moderate but I think that is because they are forced to be. I think they are a respectable party.</p>
<p>In grade 8 I first became political. I was a anti-statist and even flirted with communism. Later I dropped communism and became an anti-statist moderate socialist. I was anti-racist and anti-fascist but I was anti-homosexual and and anti-drugs. I went though a phase when I was a moderate non-Italian Italian Nationalist. I wanted to move to Italy and be an Italian. However I was staunchly anti-racist.</p>
<p>When I started grade 10 I became apolitical apart from being anti-NWO, anti-communist and anti-capitalist. I saw and still do see communism and capitalism as 2 sides of the same coin. Later that year I drifted towards moral nihilism. Later I slowly became a nationalist and became more and more NS by the day. Eventually I was inspired by a documentary called "Nazi's: The Occult Conspiracy" and became an outright National Socialist. I became a more left wing National SOCIALIST overtime.</p>
