<p>yeah come to think of it, its probably nothing. the vatican has covered up other things though. dont mind my madman ramblings haha</p>
<p>well, when I studied the ancient hebrews I found out that jehovah was originally just one of many Semitic gods. his cult developed into monotheism slowly over time as his followers took over other cults, and with them took the qualities of their gods and applied them to jehovah. so although the jews and monotheists believe jehovah was always the one god of the jews the truth is that they consolidated the power of their other gods into him.</p>
<p>but thats dealing with ancient hooknose histories, modern christians have a completely different perspective of monotheism i will admit. sorry if you disagree with me, i can cite my sources</p>
<p>i suppose you are right though, it doesnt make sense for different gods to exist that say youre a nonbeliever if you dont worship them. maybe theyre just jealous gods. i try to not conflict a whole lot with the christians here on IM, I can respect them and their religion and its better to work with other fascists than pointless divisions. bear says she wants to bring you back to being a catholic though, is this true?? some of my family is yes but thats back on the east coast, nobody where i live is. I used to be able to, I dont remember much anymore though. im trying to learn standard german now haha. swastikas and black suns are some of my favorite symbols. i love ancient germanic artwork, some of the things theyve dug up in the danish bogs are amazing. yes i follow newer traditions as well, I consider folk traditions to be a continuation of pagan beliefs in some mild form. theres a whole book called "pow-wow magic" from pennsylvania, it has nothing to do with indians though. its a collection of folk healing charms and remedies and some are almost identical to ancient germanic magic, like chants for healing a broken horses leg or using an arrowhead to draw out poison.</p>
<p>with water or other fluids I take it outside and pour it on a tree, with food i toss it outside towards birds or something, the hay is burned so that takes care of that, and any ashes afterwards i collect in a bowl and dump outside when its full. yeah, and its scary how unavoidable most of it is. food companies here soak chicken breasts in fat to make it look larger, I wish i was joking.</p>
<p>thank you, ive spent years studying my religion so I better know how to worship haha. never heard that term before, I like it. "work and pray"<br />right? I think physical labor and work are some of the best times to meditate and relax personally. and no of course not! always willing to help others.</p>
<p>so have you read any works on germanic paganism, or just started studying it?</p>
