<p>I want to see the Atlantic Wall and the Maginot Line one day. That would be some tourism!</p>
<p>Was it a coastal defense installation? I know they built them on the west coast to defend from the Japs. I would explore them all the time when I lived in Hawai'i, Oahu is littered with old fortifications and guns. I even found an old bunker in the depths of the jungle, I would venture deep into the valley I lived in, way past where people had houses. I'm surprised I never ran into any drug fields, they are usually hidden back there.</p>

<p>Tell me more about that, my Roman history knowledge is sadly deficient for an Italian. I have only read very general works on the topic. Was it broad or did you cover a specific period?</p>

<p>Tomorrow I have my first day of final exams. I just finished my Historical Investigation paper, tell me your thoughts! It may not be poetry but I think it is interesting.</p>
