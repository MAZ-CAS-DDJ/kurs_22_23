	Hey I noticed a few more people from Arkansas have joined the forum.  I'm in Little Rock but travel around some for work.  I honestly don't care much for the christian types of fascism but I would be very interested in learning more.  Never read Codreanu or anything  I've also been meaning to get in contact with the Traditionalist Workers Party and see if they have anything going down here at all.  Also just contacted a couple people on the Daily Stormer forum, but they're out of Hot Springs.
