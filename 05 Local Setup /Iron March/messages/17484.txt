	Hey again, Sherzad.
</p>

<p>
	I'm really happy to hear from you. No insult was taken, but yeah, I was really curious what happened to you. I thought I'd never hear from you again, and that would have really been a great loss, because it's really rare to find Kurds who actually understand fascism. You're essentially one in a million, man. Even if it's only your ancestry that still connects you to Kurdistan, the fact is that you're still a Kurd, and your nation still really needs you!

	Anyway, so I've actually begun some online/offline activities already, and we're initiating a small start in both Bakur and Bashur. I guess we can get something going (even if it's just online) if we take a look at these issues and obstacles that you're facing. Because again, your knowledge is definitely very rare among Kurds. If you start learning Kurdish, getting your life squared (basically applying fascism to your own life), then we can definitely move forward.

	For starters, what's your age and where do you currently live? I'm 22 and I live in the US right now.
