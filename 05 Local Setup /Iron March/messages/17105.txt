	Yes, I don't want ZOG to have this one weapon against us. I'd rather see them dead than free to be used against us again. We won't be fooled for the third time, that I can promise.<br /><br />
	Montenegro is very different. Montenegrin identity down there is mostly civic. "I live in Montenegro so I'm Montenegrin." Very small percentage actually believes in separate identity from Serbs, thats why there are less and less people who declare Montenegrin language as their native and almost non attend Montenegrin Orthodox Church. The referendum they had to separate from us was rigged and everyone knows that. People of Montenegro are prisoners of literal criminal ring so it's just matter of time before they lose any credibility there and union between our two states comes again. Hell, most montenegrins despise people who want to differ from Serbs.<br /><br />
	My chauvinism against Croats is justified by history and every sane Serbs should have that chauvinism so that we don't make mistakes that will cost us our biological existence.Â
