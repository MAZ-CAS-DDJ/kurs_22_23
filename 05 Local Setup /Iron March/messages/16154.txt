	Thank you, I understand exactly what you mean. While I do think that viewing Fascism in terms of restoring Truth/the Natural Order can beÂ a good thing (and I think it is defintely what we should aim for), I do agree that there have been too many non-sequiturs made here in this forum in explaining it as such, and now people just wanna go &gt;MUH TRUTH sometimes.

	I personally think that if there's any one piece of media that explains the Fascist worldview concisely, it's that one William Luther Pierce video where he says "Our purpose is the Creator's purpose; We are the Universe understanding itself." While it may sound like hippie new-age bs at a glance, when you think about it, he's absolutely right. We're born to push ourselves to our potential, understand the world around us, and add beauty of our own to it, from exploring space to building cathedrals to writing symphonies.
