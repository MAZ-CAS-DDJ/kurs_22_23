	So. Are you familiar with the concept of <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vuWfVPT.png" rel="external nofollow">Involution</a>? Maybe you already know this, but the Latin word 'religio' means 're-connection'. All of our problems are coming from the fact that we have separated ourselves from God, thus we need something to reestablish this connection. As Fascists, we know that all humans are different, but most of us didn't want to see the conclusion of this fact, namely that different people <em>need</em> different religions. Let me use a metaphor: you say <em>'ruhê'</em>, I say <em>'szellem'</em>. Now, we can clearly see that those are two different words, but both means <em>'spirit'</em>. None of us states that the word we are using is the only true name of the concept of spirit, but that's what our people are using. We also know that when we are talking about spirit, a theologian will have a different understanding of it than a child.

	Now, some says that there are only three religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. They are correct in a sense that these three are the only <em>institutionalized</em> religions. Pagan mysteries were exclusive, what means that every class and every profession had a different cult even if they were parts of the same Tradition. Abrahamic religions merged these cults, that's why every member of a Christian society has to go to the Church, and that's why a 100 year old theologian receives <em>the same</em> sermon as a 10 year old child. This uniformization was clearly the sign that we have entered the dark age of the masses.

	Even with this, religions are inevitably continue to change because humans themselves are changing. It is very important that the essence of the teaching must always stay the same, the only thing what we are allowed to change is the way it is being told. The modern man won't learn Koine Greek to read the original Bible. (There is a possibility for self-archaification, which means that you embrace your ancestor's way of thinking, thus becoming able to understand the ancient texts much more clearly than those who need the re-interpretations of the Clergy; but that's a very rare gift. Everybody is able to archaificate themselves in an extent (<a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/6421-retrowave-thread/" rel="">see Retrowave :D</a>), but that's usually not enough to revive Traditional cults.) If a religion can change organically, then it is possible to keep its teaching intact, but there is a slow erosion what will destroy every religion in the end.

<p>
	Here comes the question of reformation, what originally means what you mentioned; a return to the purest form of a religion. The problem is that those who intended to reform a religion were never humble enough to see that they don't understand it fully. When they destroy the organic extension of the religion which were built up by those changes through the centuries they end up with something they can't fully understand, and thus they are misinterpreting it. These people are unable to see the essence what unites, only the substance what divides, that's why every reformation led to mindless conflict. Think of it like this: if you want to understand the life of your grandfather you have to understand the life of your father - and you have to understand yourself first, not only your physical appearance, what is secondary, but your inner essence. That's why those who could really reform a religion will never do it, because they understand that the mass needs what the Church built up for their sake in the past.

<p>
	In a nutshell, there is nothing wrong with exploring the foundations of your religion, but
</p>

<p>
	1. you have to start with bettering yourself
</p>

<p>
	2. you can't expect and/or force others to follow you
</p>

<p>
	Neo-Paganism is a perfect example. Those "Wotanists" want to create an institutionalized religion (which has nothing to do with original Paganism) and they want to achieve goals which their ancestors never cared about. That's how the rich mysteries of their forefathers are becoming bizarre movements of social engineering. Most of them aren't even Theists.
</p>

<p>
	The same applies to those ISIS bastards, who are following heresies like Wahhabism, Salafism and Takfirism. I know that you have hostile feelings towards Islam, but let me cite Meister Eckhart, a Christian mystic:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Theologians may quarrel, but the mystics of the world speak the same language.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You have to know that in the end, Truth is free from all concepts - God has no religion. Do not follow your ancestors, but the principle they followed, and do it unhesitatingly and unweariedly, and then you will realize that the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/i4Kydb9.png" rel="external nofollow">goal is the same, it's only our ways what are different</a>.

<p>
	Listen to the first recording here: <a href="http://uniteinthelight.org/audio/" rel="external nofollow">http://uniteinthelight.org/audio/</a> That's an insight to Sufi Islam, the mysticism of that religion. If you can find it somewhere, read the "The Individual and the Becoming of the World" by Julius Evola too.

	Where is your writing on Yazdânism by the way? :P
