<p>Haha wow; if this is true, no offence name-changer you have made clear that you like to prank people, then that is clever. And to be frank, I don't think I've called your christianity charade out - unless I've accidentally stumbled upon it in one of my older posts - it did seem awfully strange though how in a short space of time not too long ago you turned to protestant theology, and then went full theonomy a bit later. But the question is, why would you want to trick forum users - some - who don't participate (in my knowledge) that actively, or at all? It's a good ruse, and as you say turns people away from the pointless and often detrimental belief systems of christianity - the whole guilt, he died for muh sins bull, muh compassion, muh- blabla, etc. </p>

<p>It's a fed tactic lel, agitating extremist tendencies within otherwise indifferent christians and moulding them into an entirely different form; I doubt even the more reactionary and conservative elements of the christian churches would accept their distorted belief system. </p>

<p>Also, who's CI?</p>
