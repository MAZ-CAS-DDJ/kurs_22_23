<p>yeah, and ive noticed in history and anthropology they NEVER mention the origins or culture of ancient europeans or just sorta glance over it, they focus on diversity now .most history professors probably dont even know what an indoeuropean is. white guilt just makes no sense to me, its sad to see how brainwashed most of our race is. i grew up with lots of brother grimm tales as well, i like european folktales in general. my favorite book in the bible as a kid was revelations <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> im just edgy like that I guess haha. ive grown to appreciate other parts of it, mostly the new testament. old testament is just too much jew stuff for me.</p>
<p>yeah, europeans have almost always been opposed to jewish nature. when we were pagans we had no concept of usury, when we were christian we banned it. im hoping the riots at the recent trump rally will explode a little more, they were kinda weak from what i heard. I thought a race war was gonna start, oh well. someone tried to kill trump though, which is interesting. speaking of lifting i need to work out more for the race war. do you do any kind of training?</p>

<p>ill check it out sometime! thanks for the links. and yeah unfortunately im the black sheep of the family. i have an uncle who used to be a neo nazi and a grandpa whos a WWII veteran but sorta had sympathies with the germans because of his ancestry, so I get along with them at least. both are still too content with their existence to really do or say anything though. it is sad to see so many whites with no concept of unity or brotherhood, even with their own nations and countrymen, let along all white men.</p>

<p>yeah unfortunately in america it usually is. hippies ruin everything, even wickermen! and not sure, im sure theyve at least browsed the forums but none of the regular users seem like FBI agents. yeah i suppose thats true. I need to get back into it if I want to say prayers over my hex charms</p>
<p>how tall are you? im 6 feet 3 inches</p>
