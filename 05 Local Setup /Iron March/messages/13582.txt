	Well sort of, it's definitely born of the kind of mentality that we had developed on here, Ben who is the head of propaganda for <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> is a co-admin on IM with me, he's just too busy with <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> nowadays to be on IM all that much or do any admin stuff. Pretty sure one of the other <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> founders used to be on IM for a bit before <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> came about, so again, it can be said that it's a product of this understanding we have on IM because it was made by people who come from IM, but its not like a "product of IM" in the sense that we made it.
