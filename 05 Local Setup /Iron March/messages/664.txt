<p>I am pretty good.  Started a second job over the weekend.  I'll be chasing my tail for the next eight weeks, but it'll put a serious dent in my student loans.  So I am very excited!  How about yourself?  How is life treating you?</p>

<p>It happened because of my father, he is the real language lover in my family, so i grew up surronded by books about languages.</p>
<p>I think that is celtic languages that fascinates me the most, goidelic or brythonic, and after out of IE language, the Mandarin.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You are a lucky chap!  Is he a professor, diplomat, or just a curious guy?</p>
<p>I am impressed that you have studied Mandarin.  I tend to stick with the Latin alphabet anytime I can. haha.  How interested are you in historical languages?</p>
<p>How big is the gulf between goidelic and brythonic languages?</p>

<p>A lot of anarchists are more "rebellious teenager", ultra-individualists, nihilists, anomists than true anarchists.</p>
<p>For me, it was worst, most anarchists i knew was anarcho-communists, so with the antifascism, antiracism, the support of race-mixing,  israel or arabs ... pfff.</p>
<p>For example they even opposed to the family concept.</p>
<p>Nothing to do with real anarchy from the 19th century.</p>
<p>I agree that we have to rethink about it, because the mono-nuclear family with one child, it is degenerate most than chimp society, but no family at all, nonsense.</p>
<p>I think that anarchy is a good passageway, (to put things back flat; and to have the critical thinking) but we can not stay long anarchist</p>
<p>"this is in black flags that are made most beautiful shirts".</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I don't know how far individualism has sunk into the core of French or Breizh values, but Americans are obsessed with it.  Our only philosophers of note (if even that can be said) Whitman and Thoreau are sickeningly self-absorbed.  Even as an anarchist they repulsed me.  </p>
<p>I would agree that the nuclear family with <em>one</em> child is degenerate only as it doesn't meant the replacement rate.  Otherwise, I have no problem with the nuclear family.  It should remain a sub-unit of the larger family or clan, but otherwise I don't have a problem with the nuclear family.  Could you explain your thoughts on this matter?</p>
<p>You are right, 19th century anarchism is an admirable ideology, and I think that not only anarchy but all revolutionary ideologies are a passageway for us.  The instability of the 19th and early 20th centuries was the greatest ally of fascism and even communism.  We must applaud any destabilizing force as it will pave the way for us to replace the liberal establishment.  </p>

<p>I am against such thing like the right to vote, but petitions, control rights, right of inspection, right to propose, at less at the local level and for citizens/workers; why not ?</p>
<p>If we select well, even a simple citizen would be from the elite.</p>
<p>I think  give citizenship only to fathers of families, with "pure" blood with both racial and eugenist standards, without any criminal antecedent, having performed their military service, having a job, after psychological and pyschotechnical testing  ...</p>
<p>Obviously, with this select, no homosexuals, drug addicts,  or young or old retarded.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That is a good point.  Petitions and such are acceptable, but (as we both know) this "rulership is a human right" is a load of malarky.  I understand your views on citizenship, but I think they are too much an attempt to recreate the admirable society of ancient IE people.  I would suggest that citizenship be granted to the top 10 or 20 percent of scorers on a standardized test.  Other avenues of citizenship would be open to those that performed community or military service.</p>
<p>I also disagree with your feelings against homosexuality.  I have no love for pride parades, but otherwise I see nothing worng with it.</p>

<p>I didn't say without currency, of course it is suitable, but a new form, a currency exchange, without any value in itself, so no thing like interest or usury that create values from nothing.</p>
<p>A return to the standard.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Ah ok.  I misread what you said.  I agree that interest is abhorrent, but I am not sure if anything more socialistic than the Scandinavian system could be sustained at least until folkish consciousness has reached the levels of old.   </p>

<p>That is why my system is subsidiarist, is the local level is not sufficien, we refer to the upper level with a planified market;</p>
<p>Belgians must sell coal and iron to indiana in exchange for corn and limestone for example. There is no problem. So you can build your airplanes ^^</p>
<p>Like the third reich international economy : exchange and not a free market. Nothing utopic.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Understandable.  That being said, the Third Reich's pan-European economic policy was hardly a model of cooperation.  As much as I admire the National Socialists in some regards they were German nationalist first and foremost.  The pan-European rhetoric was borne out of necessity.</p>

<p>And best with only pagans <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>Very true!  The true tragedy of modern paganism is that it is separated from the family due to the fact that it is no longer the dominant societal belief system.</p>
<p>It would be great to see society return to the old religion.  I am not a particularly spiritual person, but I would gladly join a community that advocates the veneration of ancestors.  We owe them everything in the literal sense of the word.</p>
