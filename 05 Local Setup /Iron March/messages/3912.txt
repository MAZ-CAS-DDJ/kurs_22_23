<p>Pff let me think where to start. Bulgaria its beutifull land i mean realy beutifull (how the commecial say it :Magic live here! ) it have everything, rivers, lakes, mountains, forests, beaches: you like skiing or hiking and camping or swiming THATS IS YOUR PLACE!! Same applies for culture tourism.  We have rich culture most of all dont destroyed by christianity. And above all we are nice toward friendly white foreigners if you respect us we will answer with same. If you are a impudent dumbass then you dont want to hold grudge with us..</p>
<p>As came for politics its same different story... The state it's on a verge of civil war. The country treasure was smuggle away in 90s and now we work for nothing, many has fled.. All pm's are jewish liberals, the gypos are virtually uncontrolable, and the things get worse with every EU directive command us to continue to feed them, love them, integrate (which mean no laws are applied for them, they live on social welfare and dont even think to work, only go stealing and robbing..) The country is rulled by thugs and even now curently goverment are all mafia members who infite americans to build military bases to protect them from the people.. its sad but now we are almost banana colony..   And there we came made actions, open peoples eyes, gather supporters. But things are at level that without blood to be spill things will never get better.</p>
<p>And there came medieval reenactments. Sometime you just need to go away for couple of days to give your mind a rest blow some steam off. Our organization have strict moral rules about drinking so the "blood and honor" methods of "rest and recovery" are at least unwanted.  So everybody have some hobby and mine is to get 2 times in month with some friends to talk about past to discuss how our forefathers solve their problems.. And with that came pretty nice collection of cold weapons too <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> so basicly this is .</p>
<p>As for me lately i have no time for fun most go from home to work and opposite, have preparations to coming elections and this is basically everything..</p>
<p>P.S</p>
<p>Australia is beutifull land too and have nice culture and history even though it was 200 years old. Your white settlers way is kind of redneck but the hardships made you self sustaining and tought bastards.. If you are a descendent of settlers <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
