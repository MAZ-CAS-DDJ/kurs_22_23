<p>I have to agree. People will dislike me for this but I don't consider other races "inferior" I just think a people should have it's own place where they make the rules according to their needs. The current democratic one size fits all (consumerism/liberalism) is simply not working. Also sometimes I feel that liberals have no sense of power politics. I mean sure the leaders must have but the ground troopers simply can't understand simply things like that political vacuum creates chaos because somebody must fill it. One example would be the Arab spring. I already knew what will possibly happen. The "freedom wanting people" will be overwhelmed by the Islamists or Tribal people. In Iraq etc the old arab socialist regimes simply kept these crazy people down. Now the political forces trying to find their new leaders etc. </p>

<p>I would say the next big thing might be the Kurds waging a bigger war in that area because the US etc are supplying them and they are allowed to have their own militias inside Iraq etc. The Kurds want their own independent state that would cut out a big chunk of Iraq and other countries in the area.</p>

<p>The rise of ISIS was a bit surprising for me. I never really looking into the groups that were fighting the US occupation. I still hope Assad can somehow kick their ass. Maybe the middle east could use a "baath" Renaissance to get these cartoonishly cruel militants down. Saddam wasn't that bad, especially compared to the terror and chaos after the fall of his regime. </p>
