<p>Yeah I suppose youre right, but the rural parts of America are heavily conservative. The problem is the urban people but lets be honest, who is the least likely to have a gun or have any practical training that doesnt involve computers? City people, and that includes nig nogs. As much as they like to pretend to be hardcore and know how to fight, most nigs are extremely cowardly when not in groups and they don't know shit about guns. 100 armed rednecks could slaughter 1000 negroes, even if the negroes had pistols. They wouldnt have rifles, they cant hold them sideways </p>

<p>Our main problem are the average urban white-folk, who will be hard to convince. To be honest though, I'm not sure its in the interest for the white race for most of them to survive. Sometimes a people needs hardship to shake off the dead weight. </p>

<p>Yeah Afrikaners are pretty cool. I haven't met too many unfortunately, they seem to know to avoid California like a plague. She acts pretty liberal most of the time but I've known her for years and over time I've started to see the little fascist underneath. And she hates Jews and Israel but shes Arab, thats a given </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah that's what I'm hoping, shes been a little more receptive to my flirting lately but shes still pretty nervous </p>
