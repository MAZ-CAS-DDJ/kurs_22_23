<p>Pretty sure there aren't any non-cucked whites north of LAX haha, wouldn't it be better to pursue activism in mostly white areas. OC had a fuckload of white power skinheads a couple decades ago, and is still pretty conservative, not sure why Chinatown and Little Tokyo would be good, since nearly all of the whites there are non local, is visibility the concern? Regardless, shoot me a message next time there's a demonstration or get-together in LA or Long Beach, I can prove Im not LE if that's a concern.</p>
