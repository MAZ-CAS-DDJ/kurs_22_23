<p>I'll think about it, but I haven't run into too many self-described ecofascists other than Pentti Linkola.  Especially ones that are active outside of writing or social media.  I just realized I misread your question and mentioned several authors from the past.  <br /><br />Over the last few years I have had mixed feelings about issues such as the Jews and race.  In the end, yes I think 'naming the Jew' is critical, but its not always appropriate.  However very few of us have rooted out the dysfunction in our own lives, our families, and our political organizations.  This should always take precedent, and many people use discussions on liberal degeneration, jews, etc to divert their focus, often to the point of pathology.  I would familiarize yourself with the ideas of Norman Finkelstein and others who are critical of the way jews operate without being a Savitri Devi.  I also think you fundamentally have to be able to advocate your own ethnic group, but not in the way a person from Stormfront would.  I think the preservation and management of 'human biodiversity' dovetails with an ecofascist outlook.  <br /><br />Here are random people I've come across who are <em>ecofascistic.</em><br /><br />Pentti Linkola - I'd guess you're familiar with him, his writings are available as a pdf online.  <br /><br />I think people involved with ATWA have an ecofascist outlook.  Note how in this playlist you've got Derrick Jensen and James Mason videos side-by-side.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWqFQSJooa_vQtcPEHj3olpFCNzTZfKmd" rel="external nofollow">link</a>  I really dont know the much about ATWA and I'd guess its a complete waste of time. <br /><br />Again, here we have fascists selling Derrick Jensen's Deep Green Resistance book right along side various NS books<a href="http://kadulle.com/tuote-osasto/kirjat/" rel="external nofollow"> link</a>.  As they are Finnish, of course they are influenced by Linkola.  I dont know much about them, never spoken with them.<br /><br />Sebastian Ernst Ronin's minor Canadian political party advocates a deep ecology, peak-oil theory, and ethnonationalist secession based perspective.  He is eccentric and I personally don't find his writings very readable, or worthwhile.  I was already well aware that those concepts dove-tailed together.  Anyway he is implicitly an ecofascist.<br /><br />Its also worth mentioning <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/deep_ecology/" rel="external nofollow">this subreddit. </a> The guy who mods it it is a weirdo (mayonesa/brett stevens, id guess is an informant/cointelpro) but a few good people hang around there and related sections.  The user accountt1234 is eccentric but generally advocates an ecofascist outlook and I happened to notice this user <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/arminiusii" rel="external nofollow">ArminiusII </a>criticizing industrial civilization the other day.  So maybe its worth reading from time to time.<br /><br />You might also find the Walther Darre biography interesting, its called 'Blood and Soil'  Here is the <a href="http://aryanism.net/downloads/books/anna-bramwell/blood-and-soil.pdf" rel="external nofollow">pdf,</a> an actual copy is long out of print and expensive.  A lot of it isnt worth reading but I think he (and Rolf Gardiner) basically nailed it.  I personally think agrarianism is the answer.<br /><br />Also<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Heinrich_Riehl" rel="external nofollow"> Wilhelm Riehl</a><br /><br />Green Army Fraction (currently inactive) is/was a power electronics musician who commonly espoused an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS063npfwg0" rel="external nofollow">ecofascist outlook.</a><br />That audio is an american neo-nazi WIlliam Pierce.  If you're wondering, that is exactly what most power electronics sounds like, extremist quotes over noise loops.<br /><br />On an esoteric tangent, you might read about<a href="http://khidr.org/talat.halman.htm" rel="external nofollow"> Al-Khidr, an islamic prophet</a>.  After you read that and maybe a few articles on there, I would <a href="http://textosdeinteresse.blogspot.com/2008/05/spiritual-fascism-of-rene-guenon-and.html" rel="external nofollow">open this article</a> and read the part about Guenon and Khidr.  I have no idea if that is true, but Khidr is someone I'd like to do a lot more research on.</p>
<p>And are you familiar with Derrick Jensen?  He has leftist tendencies but is effectively rejected by them.  If you get past all the social-justice bullshit he is actually advocating a 'deep green resistance', an insurrectionary movement against industrial civilization.  As fascism is ultimately about revolutionary <em>action</em>, he has ended up as a fellow traveler, as a couple links above show.  I think there is a thread about him and about Ted Kaczynski here on ironmarch<br /><br />Also, you might find these articles interesting--<br /><br /><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/102634164/Antimodernism-Arthur-Versluis" rel="external nofollow">http://www.scribd.com/doc/102634164/Antimodernism-Arthur-Versluis</a></p>

<p><a href="http://jetpress.org/v23/kirby.htm" rel="external nofollow">http://jetpress.org/v23/kirby.htm</a><br /><br />DH Lawrence and Robinson Jeffers might also be authors of interest.  <br /><br /><br />Well I know this was rambling but I hope it helps.  </p>

<p>I'm also interested in any reading you would recommend, now or in the future.<br /> </p>
