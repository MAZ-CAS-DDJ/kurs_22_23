	These are great news! You will be my master in alchemy in no time for that is one of the disciplines I always found interesting but never had the time to actually take a deeper look into it. Also, welcome to the <em><strong>SUPRANATIONAL LEVEL.</strong></em> Fascist Empire when? :D

	As for myself, I went to a Perturbator show in Budapest and also made a shirt &amp; bought a skull mask so finally I could post a picture to the 5 year anniversary thread (hope to see a photo of great mountains and a guy with skull mask some day there).

	Don't worry about your message, no need for rush. I just wanted to know if you are alright (well, besides the usual Kali Yuga stuff), it could be dangerous to live in Kurdistan nowadays, amirite?
