<p>Glad to see another member with his head screwed on the right way. Keynes was a big government court jester, not a serious economist. He told politicians what they wanted to hear instead of the hard nosed objective truth of real economics. Any Fascist in the 22 century who can't see that Capitalism is the most productive system man ever devised is either fooling himself or is likely a closet red. People who associate free markets, property and private enterprise with big banks and stock swindling don't understand what they're talking about. In a true free market few stock marketing scum swindlers could exist because most corporations are on life support from big government and the FED couldn't exist without a State charter. The free market is the only antidote to bank corruption and multinational mega corporations. Capitalism =/= multiculturalism and race betrayal, any reading through Hoppe or Rothbard proves that beyond question. Strong borders and a smart race policy are essential to any successful Capitalist economy. Soon enough folks are going to realize that it's Cultural Marxism that's behind immigration and Globalization, not true Capitalism. If Fascism is to succeed Capitalism must be adopted, no ands ifs or buts about it. Thanks for writing friend.</p>
