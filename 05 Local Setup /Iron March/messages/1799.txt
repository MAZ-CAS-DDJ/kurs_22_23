<p>hey there is a page on reddit called </p>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/" rel="external nofollow">http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/</a> </p>
<p>where users can request to take control of subreddits where the mods are inactive/unresponsive. Some antifa types will likely take control of the iron march subreddit via this system if you stay inactive much longer.  i thought of this because im in the process of grabbing r/jidf</p>
