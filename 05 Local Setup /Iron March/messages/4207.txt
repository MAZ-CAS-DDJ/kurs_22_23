<p>My only criticism is that you misunderstood Spengler's rejection of Darwinism. He simply thought that evolution is guided by destiny but not determined by causality. Goethian Evolution vs Darwinism. The former a moral fulfillment unless I was misinformed. The latter Spengler thought was mired by Anglo-Saxon capitalistic/viking thinking - essentially - every man for himself.</p>
