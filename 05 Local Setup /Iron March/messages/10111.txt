<p>I think the main difference between old and new times is that now life is much easier. That means this "ignore the reality" thing couldn't exist even in the early 1800s. Death was a guest everybody knew first hand so they were more stoic and even realistic knowing their limitations. Also there were no places for pointless people. There was no such thing as unemployment or activists and no media either. Personally I hate activists and journalists the most. Journalists are a pointless middle man between happenings and the readers they are self important liberal cunts and activists are pretty much faggots who live off from tax payer money. </p>

<p>Imagine them in the medieval or early industrial world. They would starve to death on the street at best.</p>

<p>I have to agree. The focus shifted away too much from values to consumerism and humanistic feel good BS. In some ways man are supposed to act like woman now with all this "caring". No wonder why mainstream politics are different shades of liberal. Like the UK PM saying Britain should adapt to the muslims. Yeah. "conservatives".</p>
