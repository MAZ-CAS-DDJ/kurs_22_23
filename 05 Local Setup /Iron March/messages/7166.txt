<p>Yes, that's right! Well, university is too expensive, and student loans here are a death trap. So once I earn more money, I will go into a 4-month training period to become a Nurse's Assistant. After that I can make more money to start taking classes to become a real nurse!<br /><br />Ohhh man right before I wrote you this, I was watching part of that game at my aunt's house. It was very entertaining! Yeah, I work a full-time job, looking for another, and I take care of my old dad. Hopefully I will be on here more. One of the fewer places one does not have to listen to... well, everything else one has to listen to!<br /><br />I sang the Thompson one, Put u Raj. Lots of dramatic arm gestures xD</p>
