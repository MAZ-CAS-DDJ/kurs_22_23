<p>I recently made a new topic about Hachtivist group anonymous:http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/topic/691-anonymous-tries-and-fails-to-hack-the-vatican/</p>
<p>Basicly wanted to give you a heads up about a new development about new insights as to how they operate and the implications on future IT security developments.</p>
