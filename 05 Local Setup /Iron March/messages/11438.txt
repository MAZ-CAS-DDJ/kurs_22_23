<p>Hmmm well I don't know what your Pilgrim is, if by that you mean to visit churches then I would recomend visiting temple of St. Sava (2nd largest orthodox building in the world) and church of St. Mark (sarcophagus of our tsar Du≈°an is there) both in Belgrade. You're Danish so you'r ekinda privliged, and could go on our holy land under occupation - Kosovo and Metohija. It's basically church land with very old medieval churches, many of them now in ruins since NATO intervention and Albanian chimpouts in 2004 pogrom.<br /><br />Since I'm from Belgrade I could only tell you about places here in detail, could personally guide you if I get free time from faculty.</p>
