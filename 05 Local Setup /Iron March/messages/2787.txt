<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I still think you're an asshole, but I currently don't see an alternative to Iron March anywhere else online.</p>
<p>Just switch back my user title from Serf to something dignifying.</p>
<p>Your comment on the One-drop rule is bullshit, by the way, I don't know where you got that one. Prince William married a commoner, Kate Middleton. Besides, it's not like my family had a choice, it was the USSR. My mother is of Donetsk Kozak blood on her father's side and 1/2 peasant 1/2 Kievan aristocratic blood on her mother's (thanks to 1917's repressions).</p>
<p>Anyways, this totally isn't relevant to you, nor do you / nor should you care.</p>
<p>Moving on; we may have absolute contempt for one another, and I still consider you a brainwashed Stalinist peasant, but I'm still a dedicated Fascist and a promoter of this forum.</p>
<p>In no way is this an apology of any sort, if you assume it comes off this way, but it's better to retain some sort of truce, otherwise the only other option is for me to start a forum of my own, potentially dividing the movement. This sort of decentralization wouldn't be beneficial for anyone. Strength through Unity, right?</p>
<p>It's up to you, whether you want more Fascists loyal to the IMF or not.</p>
<p>If the IM movement gets anywhere, it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a person of my blood be a member, am I right, or am I right? I think I've my case. Potential good publicity is potential good publicity.</p>
