<p>I am not making this about me, I am saying why the rest of us got involved and calling out your claim how you did nothing to provoke anyone, when you clearly had done so and Ben's post is not flaming, you said some ridiculous things that lacked an actual point and he demonstrated how it all lacks any sense to which you replied with some accusations. Don't know where you thought you were going with that initial post but it went all over the place and failed to make an actual point and instead of clarifying it after being pointed to the problem you started insulting Ben. You got what you got as a result.</p>
