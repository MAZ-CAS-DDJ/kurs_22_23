<p>Please delete the 3 topis that i created because what i wanted to post only gives that message . </p>
<p>How can i post my article withou appearing that ? </p>
<p>This is what i wanted to say : </p>
<p>According to "say" April 25, 1974 "brought to Portugal FREEDOM ... FREEDOM ... FREEDOM</p>
<p>That I was, am and will always be Salazar, I am forced to agree that now we really have FREEDOM. Consider this:</p>
<p>------ We are FREE to be assaulted, robbed, assaulted or murdered in our house on the street, in the car, a shop, a restaurant, school, the Police</p>
<p>Police, Cemetery, etc.., etc. ..</p>
<p>Of course in time Dr.SALAZAR we had (or wanted) this FREEDOM</p>
<p>------ We are FREE to insult our leaders calling them thieves, thieves, liars and any and all names that may come to mind.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "silence is consent"</p>
<p>Of course at the time of Dr. Salazar had not (nor wanted) this FREEDOM</p>
<p>There was this kind of rulers, because the way forward, then, was the arrest or escape abroad. Now is different, with freedom,</p>
<p>can go to Paris to Cape Verde, CEO of big government or private companies, municipalities, etc. - freedom of choice is great.</p>
<p>------ We are FREE to beat the teachers, the police, the parents of the students, etc. .. For something good is freedom</p>
<p>Of course at the time of Dr. Salazar had not (nor wanted) this FREEDOM.</p>
<p>------ We are FREE to speak ill of the Portuguese State, to admit illegal immigration, to live with international mafia gangs, etc. ..</p>
<p>Of course at the time of Dr. Salazar that we had FREEDOM and others do not dare, come over here, not even for holidays!</p>
<p>------ FREE We are having an army to defend us (?) And fight in Bosnia, Iraq, Palestine, etc.., But could not defend citizens</p>
<p>Portuguese Overseas Provinces, could abandon former comrades in arms and to identify them before the enemy, delivering 90% of a state with</p>
<p>800 years of history and 500 years of an area one and indivisible.</p>
<p>Of course in the time that Dr. Salazar had no FREEDOM</p>
<p>Military service was compulsory, had to defend territory and citizens. When necessary we entered the war not to attack but to defend ourselves</p>
<p>I know there were some deserters, few, but there were many volunteers. Dr. Salazar knew instill in our generation, the duty to SERVE OUR COUNTRY</p>
<p>Why America is not the Americans and the Indians? Australia of Australian Aboriginal and non? New Zealand of New</p>
<p>Zealanders and not of Indigenous Peoples, the British Falkland Islands and not Argentinas?? etc.., etc.., in that order of ideas was the Portuguese Overseas</p>
<p>Portugal</p>
<p>At the time it has been done a referendum to the people overseas have voted to continue Portuguese, Why? The answer is so simple, but</p>
<p>see:</p>
<p>PORTUGAL fought for fifteen (15) long years in Guinea, Angola and Mozambique (a land area 25 times the European Portugal)</p>
<p>fought and won this war. There was no public disorder in Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and Timor were fighting Macau.Portanto</p>
<p>only all the great and rich provinces and the enemy composed of armed and paid by foreign capital, with bases in neighboring territories.</p>
<p>Portugal won the war because he made a war of defense of national territory and of the Portuguese with the help, cooperation and willingness of all</p>
<p>citizens. If the people of these territories was against PORTUGAL, we did not do a year of war, the defeat was at the time. Consider the example of only</p>
<p>TIMOR, small territory who defeated the giant Indonesian-then yes, people wanted independence.</p>
<p>------ We are FREE under the interference of external policies, the Troika visit (we have the 3rd), we do not have our money, to destroy our</p>
<p>production system, our merchant marine, our fleet of fishing for cod to sell to foreign capital large Portuguese companies,</p>
<p>For example, Galp, EDP, Shipyards, the Tap (?), etc.., quit large companies Lusalites, Lisnaves, etc. .., our gold reserves, etc.</p>
<p>Anyway we are FREE to all sorts of nonsense that comes to mind.</p>
<p>Of course at the time of Dr. Salazar did not have (nor wanted) this FREEDOM.</p>
<p>At that time the Foreign came late to offer loans to Portugal who proudly refused</p>
<p>As thought and said ALL FOR NOTHING AGAINST THE HOMELAND HOMELAND</p>
<p>------ We have FREE Parliamentarians in Lisbon, Madeira, the Azores and in Brussels - paid their weight in gold and full of perks, with reforms</p>
<p>Lifetime after duns "anitos good life," which do no more than slagging each other and try to get the Power to there "" they say</p>
<p>some (of them) politicians "" is "a" gorge villenage ""</p>
<p>Of course at the time of Dr. Salazar did not have (nor wanted) this FREEDOM.</p>
<p>------ Finally we are FREE so much to be (mis) colonized.</p>
<p>Of course at the time of Dr. Salazar did not have (nor wanted) these FREEDOMS</p>
<p>------ The politicians are now accusing Dr. Salazar to have clung to power - is one that was there many years to come, no one took it from there. Maybe</p>
<p>for the same reason set out above, PEOPLE WERE WITH HIM.</p>
<p>These same politicians who accuse him are the same as walking from the April 25, 1974 in Power or the Power Wheel.</p>
<p>------ I could be here all night to give an example of FREEDOMS who brought us the April 25, but frankly, I prefer the FREEDOMS that a Government</p>
<p>authoritarian, patriotic and nationalistic gave us. For our freedom ends where the freedom of others begins, and only a STATE ENOUGH</p>
<p>STRONG NOT TO BE VIOLENT respects and respect the freedoms of each others.</p>
<p>Finally, just ask God that brings us another any DR. SALAZAR to clean the house, even so, you will need the help of good, decent and brave</p>
<p>PEOPLE OF PORTUGAL.</p>
