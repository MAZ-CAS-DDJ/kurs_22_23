<p>I'm not so much against evolution as I am atheists who believe evolution tells the whole story or accept it unquestionably or think it's separate from a godly creator. There is a vast body of evidence in support of the theory of evolution, good evidence which isn't in conflict with Christian teachings.</p>
<p>Archaeology and anthropology reveal that many different men and humanoid types were on earth tens of thousands of years before Adam; I'm certainly not a young earth creationist. The skeletal remains of these beings have been found all over the planet. Some resemble races now existing, some represent more primitive humanoid types. Bible "fundamentalists" and "Christian" humanists claim Adam was the first humanoid or man, and was consequentially the father of all peoples and races on earth, or ever existed on the earth. This is derived from their a universal interpretation of Scripture, and their denial of what history and science reveal on the matter. When God cursed and cast out Cain, God placed a "mark" on Cain, "lest any finding him should kill him." <sup>15 </sup>Then the Lord said unto him, Doubtless whosoever slayeth Cain, he shall be <sup>[</sup><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%204:14-15&amp;version=GNV#fen-GNV-95b" rel="external nofollow"><sup>b</sup></a><sup>]</sup>punished seven fold. And the Lord set a <sup>[</sup><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%204:14-15&amp;version=GNV#fen-GNV-95c" rel="external nofollow"><sup>c</sup></a><sup>]</sup>mark upon Cain, lest any man finding him, should kill him." <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%204:14,15&amp;version=GNV" rel="external nofollow">(Gen. 4:14,15)</a>. The statements clearly indicate other people already existing at the time of Adam, Eve and Cain. Yet those who always apply a literal interpretation of the Bible say that Adam and Eve were the first humans on earth. Now by this point liberal christians, young earth creationists and "fundamentalists" do the only thing they can do and distort Scripture. Scripture tells us that Adam and Eve had no other children when Cain killed Abel. So who were the people Cain was afraid would kill him? Where did all the people come from that made up the city Cain established? The Christian humanists cannot explain these Biblical facts.</p>
<p>In other words Adam wasn't the first humanoid.</p>
<p>A misconception is that over the term creationism. Creationism is not Christianity. Creationism is just based on Christian "fundamentalism" or "Judeo-Christian" theology, which many are now discovering to be a distorted Christianity (a mixture of the Bible and human precepts).</p>
<p>I actually find very little to disagree with on evolutionary theory, personally, but in all honesty I don't know for sure, but whenever I say this atheists are quick to jump on this one time I say it, yet it's okay when they say they "don't know" something, "but the vast amount of evidence greatly supports what we say". So I repeat, it's atheism I have the problem with, not a theory of evolution, which isn't rejected by the bible at all. I'm not opposed to other theories like De-volution, in other words regression, however.</p>
<p>Maybe this section in particular will help elaborate a little bit more on where I stand</p>

<p>As far as how god came about, this is my view</p>

<p>I can elaborate more if you're interested.</p>
<p>Far from being in opposition to each other, Christianity and science go hand in hand; which is what helped prompt me to become a Christian. As you know, I'm a former atheist with a scientific background; I'm the object of every atheist and liberal's hatred.</p>
