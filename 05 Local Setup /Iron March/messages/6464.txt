<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">Ha ha, I’m a member of National Action myself, to be honest. The ‘openly racist and anti-Semitic’ article you reference actually very nearly made me change my mind though. I initially joined because I believed I could help organise them to get out onto the streets and spread some simple yet effective nationalist propaganda in the real world (I still believe that.) They’re not bad lads, they just have this desire to be seen as irreverent and incapable of being cowed by cries of “racism.” That’s the correct stance to take, in my view; however they’re obviously going about this the wrong way. I’m going to have to have a word with the leadership. Make them see sense on this point.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">I am, as you know, a Traditionalist. So my original plan was to join Generation Identity UK. I didn’t bother in the end because they seemed to display a) a complete lack of pragmatism, and <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_cool.png" alt="B)" /> a desire to present nationalism in a bourgeois form. I saw more potential in National Action and joined them instead. Generation Identity seems to have gone dormant already anyway.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">You’re probably right that the pool of young people from which radicals emerge is slowly orienting itself towards the Right – to some extent that’s true. But before we can really reap the rewards from that, we have to increase the overall sophistication of our movements intellectual output. I feel we’re doing better than in the past, but it still could be far better. And I’d put down people’s fascination with the Right to the fact that everyone is naturally right-wing – the Right is simply about valuing the Good, the True and the Beautiful. Of valuing things in accordance with their objective worth. Egalitarianism on the other hand is a psychological coping mechanism that some people adopt which overrides their underlying nature. That’s why the far-Left are obsessed with the Right – some of their number literally spend a lifetime studying the Right. They’re attracted to it on an unconscious level. Whereas hardly anyone on the Right really cares about the Left; other than to know that it’s ‘bad’ and ‘needs to be stopped.’</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">One problem we have is that too few young people are being made aware of the more sophisticated variants of our broadly-defined worldview. So I’m starting a little project: I’m teaching musicians, of a similar-persuasion to myself, how to <em>properly</em> compose music. That way we can have a network of Traditionalist-nationalists creating a stream of quality music containing the ideas and themes of Evola, etc. You’d be surprised at how little knowledge of music composition is possessed by musicians creating the kinds of music we’d be looking to go into. That’d give us a huge advantage – so my plan isn’t as naïve as it might at first sound, lol.</span></span></span></p>
