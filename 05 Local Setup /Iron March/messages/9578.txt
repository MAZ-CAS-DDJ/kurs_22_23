<p>I would liken it to feeling like a dying octogenarian, except for me I was 11-14. Joint pain so bad I couldn't walk farther than from my bed to the kitchen most days. Headaches all the time, almost like heat sickness except they would happen when the temperature was totally normal. Fevers too sometimes. I went through one phase where I could hardly comprehend my own thoughts. Naturally depression came along with it too. </p>

<p>When it was done I swore to never be inactive again. The moment I was feeling just a little better I was outside and doing boy shit again. I lost so much of my childhood to that fucking tick.</p>
