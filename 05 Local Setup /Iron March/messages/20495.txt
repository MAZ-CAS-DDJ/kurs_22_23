	I think that it's going to become more and more difficult to be on good terms with other races, as the intense fighting gets closer to home and as the media and politicians encourage different races and cultures to continue butting heads while they offer safety in the form of a high-tech police state.

	I don't know too much about the specific doctrine of salafism, I admire it for it's ability to inspire the Muslim world to reject degeneracy and strike back against the enemies of all humanity, specifically the Zionist and the United States, but Western Europe is also a good place for some remodeling.

	If you're asking whether I think Islam is good for white people, the answer is no. We are naturally pagans and I believe we should return our own belief systems. I'm into "Esoteric Hitlerism", but it's really just old beliefs wrapped in a poetry concerning recent events in history.

	And Devon was just a nut, that he claimed to be Muslim had little to do with what he did. Both Islam and National Socialism have had their share of nuts who snap and do stupid things.
