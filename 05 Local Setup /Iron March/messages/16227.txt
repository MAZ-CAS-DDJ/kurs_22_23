	Thanks for the concise reply.

	Sounds ideal and very interesting. I do, however, have more basic questions.
</p>

<ul><li>
		How does one go about engaging with the group or its members?
	</li>
	<li>
		What commitments does membership entail?
	</li>
	<li>
		As this is a pan-European group, what are its goals exactly? Is it basically nationalist organisation active <em>within </em>nations, but also with supporting links <em>between </em>nations? 
	</li>
</ul><p>
	Thanks from England.
