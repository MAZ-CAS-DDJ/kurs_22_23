<p>salutes from Greece. I would like you to ask you a favor. Im about to write a piece about the modern Nationalist movements in Russia for the GD youth faction website, so it seems correct for me to procure first hand testimonies of actual people involved in the events. So i would like to ask 2 questions. </p>
<p>1) Whats your take on Barkashov and the R.N.U? Do you deem them important as a legacy, on an organizational and ideological aspect in the modern Nationalist scene. </p>
<p>2) What's the current state of the Nationalist, concerning repressions from the authorities. Do you think Putin's actions just a decoy so he can break any justification for Russian Nationalism to get power. Lastly, is there a division of corrupted organizations that are working with the Authorities and thus get an elastic treatment, and between organizations that are brutally repressed by the FSB and high police officials?</p>
<p>Thanks in regard...</p>
