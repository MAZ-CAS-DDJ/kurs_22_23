<p>Zeiger, hello (and happy birthday btw). </p>
<p>I wanted to ask you something about the nofap challenge. What did that entail? Complete celibacy or just abstaining from porn, ejac and the rest "tantric" stuff?. And did you see any change in the sexual department (i read for instance that makes you "quick")?</p>
