	Sorry, got seriously distracted with real-world political stuff.

	What I want first of all is to know whether you have any kind of strategy, and a) offer assistance if you don’t, or b) enter into an exchange of ideas if you already do.

	Also could you give me an email address for Atomwaffen I can direct people to? We get quite a few Americans emailing into the <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> website asking if they can set up an <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> chapter in Texas, Oregon, etc… I'll redirect them to you guys.
