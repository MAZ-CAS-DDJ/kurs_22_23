<p>I'm ambivalent about militarism. On the one hand it has enormous mobilising and unifying power, but on the other hand, as Goebbels said paraphrasing Talleyrand, "Sitting on bayonets is uncomfortable."</p>
<p>For good reading on distributism, I suggest <a href="http://distributistreview.com/mag" rel="external nofollow">http://distributistreview.com/mag</a>. Interesting concepts include the principle of subsidiarity, a return to a revised guild system, and a particularly spiritual (for lack of a better word) perspective on the state.</p>
<p>My confusion about Wodenism was that it sounds like a Wodenist worships that god specifically, while Germanic pagans worship the pantheon as a whole, so I assumed there would be some differences.</p>

<p>I believe there is other unifying powers as well though. Also, we have to remember just taking a stance on anti-militarism doesn't undermine the sacredness of military service and sacrifice for the nation and community. </p>
<p>Thank you for the link, I am getting off soon so I will read it over tomorrow for sure. </p>
<p>Also it depends. Saying you are a Wodenist or Odinist usually means you worship and recognize the entire pantheon of Germanic Gods. One can devote themselves to one God specifically, such as Thor, but they wouldn't (in all the cases I have seen) identify as a Thorist. If one dedicates themselves to Woden or Odin they are usually of a priestly or warrior caste/human type. Another name for the religion is simply Asatru, but almost everywhere I have seen the terms Asatru and Odinism used interchangeably.</p>
