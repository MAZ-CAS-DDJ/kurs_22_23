<p>I'd definitely be interested in that booklet you plan on writing. I'm moving toward smaller spineless books at the moment, our next one is Boxing and Breeding/Fighting and Feeding and is literally a primer on why boxing and lifting and motherhood are so important, like little catechisms for Fascists <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>Yeah when I say ethno state I don't mean "land grab off the Russians" haha, I mean like Ulfheim, a compound or base with walls and barbed wire where fascist only events can occur. The more I observe the collapse of the west the more important it seems to gravitate toward a white enclave, and for all of Russia's past and current failings, at least it's majority white.</p>

<p>As for the half breed, yeah the Wolves are the same, non-whites are welcome at Ulfheim but they would never be able to oath as the entry oath requires blood sharing, so no Germanic wolf would ever share his blood with a non-white, it's just written in their makeup.</p>
