	Yup, it's me. Roki is a very cool person. He reallyÂ appreciates his fans. We were going to stay only one day in Bijeljina, but he offered to pay for our accomodation in hostel. Also when we were walking with him in the town, a lot of people were approaching him to say hello and have a chat. He is very well known in the town and people still remember him. He also gave us a bottle of homemade rakija, because the day earlier we gave him a bottle of Polish vodka as a gift from the fans.
