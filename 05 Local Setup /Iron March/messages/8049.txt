<p>Ben, I could run Sigurd better than Craig ever could. The only thing I can't do is the graphic design side of things. Could you handle that for me, if I were to head such a project?</p>
<p>If so, I can put that to Matt Tait as part of a 'package' - the evident superiority of which will force him to hand over the reigns to what was Sigurd/is Legion. And if he doesn't, we'll simply create a parallel structure which'll blow his out the water. Leaving us in much the same place, in time.</p>
<p>I've already got a group of nationalists training in boxing/kickboxing/grappling up here centred around Warrington (with the help of Matt Power.) So in that sense, the project is already off the ground...</p>
