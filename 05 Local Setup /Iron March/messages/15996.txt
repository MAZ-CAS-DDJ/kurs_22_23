			I am particularly not a believer of our asiatic origin and the whole Tangra thingy, because a random tribe from Asia can't simply come to the slavic lands, unite them and create a country out of the blue.

	Well, I don't know. In those times most of Eastern Europe was ruled by little tribes, and the Asians are <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Mongol_Empire_map.gif" rel="external nofollow">great organizers</a>, so it is not so hard to believe that they were able to unite those people. They had the advantage of the Nomad warfare too, which was much more quicker and stronger than the European one. Asians didn't gave a shit about to sustain a society, they have built great empires and those quickly collapsed.

			The whole slavic thing I see as a soviet propaganda - you know, to make more and more allies in the cold war thing and stuff. Quite a lot of stuff was forged to fit the slavic bullshitry, hell we dumped 2-3 letters from our alphabet to make it closer to the russian one.

	Yes, I have read similar things about the Romanians and their language.
