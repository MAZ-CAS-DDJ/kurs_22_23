	Well I can give a headsup to the mods via discord to keep them from  blowing your cover with a new account. And we've had the whole scottish dawn discussion in IM discord but some people are being obtuse, its mostly because of the lame identarian thing, personally I don't like it either but I kind of get it, but I think SD will do absolutely fine without using the label, and once that's out nobody on IM will have as much reason to fucking bitch.
