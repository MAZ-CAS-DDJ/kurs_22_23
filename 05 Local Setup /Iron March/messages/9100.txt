<p>I see you dabble in a bit of graphic design. Your stuff's really quite good mate. Which is useful for me on two fronts:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1) I could do with some graphics for my blog at some point, and...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2) I'm taking charge of resurrecting Sigurd Legion (with the help of others.) And I could do with some decent promotional graphics for that too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Interested?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And nah, the O9A stuff doesn't bother me. I actually know a guy here in Warrington who's into the O9A. I've always found their approach fascinating anyway - their various missions (like lying motionless on the floor for 12 hours? Or heading off into the woods to live by oneself for 3 months.) There's definitely something in me that's attracted to that part of it, regardless of whether of not I agree with the philosophy behind it; or the human sacrifice element, lol...</p>
