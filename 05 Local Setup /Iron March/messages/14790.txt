	No I was invited to Atomwaffen since their in Florida and I'm in Georgia pretty close but I declined because I can't really get down there at all plus I don't have a crew at all where I am, I was actually thinking about how to do more action although I'm not sure where i'm going to be living after I graduate this year ( in the spring I finish my senior history class) I kinda have anxiety about whats going to happen when I'm done since I don't have plans , I don't know that's just what i'm focusing on right now pretty much .
