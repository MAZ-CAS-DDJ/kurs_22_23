<p>You're very welcome, I suppose. I tend to read a lot around here but I don't often reply to threads except when I have something that I think might be worth contributing (thus my considerable length of tenure but minuscule number of posts), or when I am particularly interested, as in your case, considering the similarity of our worldviews.</p>
