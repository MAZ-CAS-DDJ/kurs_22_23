	Yeah, the more I think about I think you are right and I'll just stick to the historical sources. I am also considering taking aÂ break from reading after I get the current book that I am reading done. I mean I love reading but I feel like I have been reading so fast that I am starting to burn out a bit. Still going to order some more books though, since I have some money on gift cards, since that a way I have the books. I would probably just take a break for a day or two at a time and then get back to all of my readings. Maybe break for a day or two a week. Also, you can ask Hermann if you want...he never returns my PM's so maybe you will have better luck. Just copy the link if you do ask him though.
