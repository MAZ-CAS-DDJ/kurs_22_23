<p>I take it your lame-o professor is a Keynesian bafoon, am I right or am I right? Some neoclassicals can be pretty libby too. The problem with the FED is that anytime the government has a monopoly on something they misuse it and when the FED does this (which it always does) it destorys the value of our currency. It does this because it has the power to print money from thin air which causes inflation. Another problem is that the FED always and forever will lower interest rates beyond what the market dictates which causes the boom and bust cycle by encouraging malinvestment which eventually needs to be cleared out of the market.</p>

<p>I'm awful sorry you can't find the time to take a little vacation, but hang in there, the hard work will pay dividends in the end -or at least it should, considering we live under Obamunism, it might just mean that you and I will pay a higher income tax rate soon so the know-nothing bureaucrats can redistribute our wealth the slothful, lazy and dumb.</p>

<p>I hear ya! You have no idea how many times I've had that very argument with the folks on here. They just don't have the brains to understand what we mean, that's the problem. A lot of these folks are little worker bees themseleves and are just as lazy as the people we criticize.</p>

<p>Amen to that.</p>

<p>I don't think the workingclass is lazy, but they are stupid and that's there biggest flaw. To be honest, I almost think education should have higher standards. We need to keep a social caste like what the Hindus have in India, the dumbest on the bottom the smartest on the top. have you ever read "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxely? I like it's idea of genetic class but not to big on the drugs and sex spread throughout the book..</p>

<p>I think I'm gonna try to go on vacation in a couple of months, don't know where I want to go, but I have a new bikini I'm ready to swim!</p>
<p>I wish I knew how to make the pinkos on this board admit what they are.</p>

<p>I'd like both your two cents here and the topic, I feel you could give me a big elaboration here and a sum up in the thread. Yay! I have a real tutor who knows what they are talking about! How do we deal with the workingclass? I think they work hard but they are fucking idiotic and need to drop their pinko shit, how do we do that? Andf why is labor value discredited? My proffessor won't answer my questions on that <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_sad.png" alt=":(" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/sad@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
