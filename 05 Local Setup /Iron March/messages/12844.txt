<p>That's very interesting, but vague- just like most of what we know about our ancestors. What I'd give for a day back in a time machine, just to see how the ancient Germans worshiped! 'would've been fun': An understatement. Fun, and no need for violent uprising against degeneracy. A win all around! Maybe America would have even learned by example.<br /><br />
Wow, and I see what you mean about the degeneracy of your area. If a good old-fashioned chimpout won't uncuck the whites, what else will? They're certainly right in fearing a powerful white man, though. Self-aware, the white man has brought down continents.<br /><br />
Just the mental image is enough to scare me! I used to see shapes of big cats in the corner of my room, after watching a documentary about the primeval enemies of mankind, and that we fear certain things because of predators in our evolutionary past, but that's nothing on actual sleep paralysis. Would you say seeing the spirit world is worth all the weirdness, though?<br /><br />
Yeah, it's sad that everyone's lost sight of their place within not only the natural order, but also society. WAIT... TAILS?? And I thought weebs were bad enough. That absolutely smacks of furries- glad that's one American weakness that's not been imported over here.<br /><br />
A skinhead? Haha, now that sounds exciting! How was it, and what made you leave that scene? Ugh, leave it to the Jews to spread misinformation. I'm almost hoping she said that on purpose rather than being that ignorant of European history. My maths teacher thought we were fighting the Prussians in the first world war, but that's barely a slipup compared to that steaming pile of BS you had to listen to.<br /><br />
I guess the childishness can be partially blamed on how sheltered the upper classes were- carrying teddy bears around university and stuff like that, some of them. Nah, I don't resemble her (I wish- she wasn't called a perfect specimen of Aryan womanhood for nothing), but I've been told I look a bit like Audrey Hepburn. My grandmother certainly did in her youth. Who are you told you look most like?<br /><br />
I looked him up, and found a site I'm almost 100% certain you own- hermannmonument.com<br />
He does sound really badass tho, a pan-German before his time. Out of interest, what do you think of old Fritz? I'm doing a short speaking presentation on him for German, and I learned some stuff that tarnished the golden legend, for me. FREDDY, WHY?</p>
