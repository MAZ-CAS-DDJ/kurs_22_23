<p>Hey Blackshirt 13,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am into philosophy (I'm currently majoring in it as well) and I agree, it nice to see another Fascist philosopher. There seem to be too few of us. I'd be down with discussing some philosophy here! What did you want to talk about / what did you have in mind? What types of philosophy interest you?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, it's no bother! Thank you for messaging me; it's always nice to talk to people.</p>
