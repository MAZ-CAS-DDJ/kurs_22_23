<p>we're literally giving max freedom, if you want to do it like a series I'm all for it. If you want to condense all his activities to one article that's fine. If you want to dedicate a separate article to one particular thing he's done is also fine. The main thing we're focusing on is quality content and exclusive materials, everything else is subservient to that goal so there's no strict limitations or restrictions or whatever. Frankly only demand is that it's nothing small, like less than A4 page worth of text? That's the only thing strictly speaking.</p>

<p>Anyway if you'll be a dedicated author we'll need to set you up with your own account, something I have to make for you if you're taking this on srsly.</p>
