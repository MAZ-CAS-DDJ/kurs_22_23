	Eh, well maybe it would hurt to do the random thing idk. Don't really find the girls in my classes attractive (I have a type) so I'll pretty much just have to try complimenting or starting a conversation with some random girl that I find attractive even if I don't know them.

	PS I decided to delete the old republic permenatly because I am playing it so much that it is starting to affect my studies. So, that is now gone forever. I just keep finding video games to be boring anyways. Also, the time spent on that could go towards reading for fun or spending time on the Dulingo app. So yeah, will never mention old republic again so lets just pretend it never happened.
