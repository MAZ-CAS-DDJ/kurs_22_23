<p>I think the Eureka Swastika is perfect, brings to the liberal and Marxist establishment a symbol of their nightmares come true, burns the eyes of any moderate nationalist and nothing encompasses the natural order and this worldview greater than it, in it's symbol of white power, anti-semitism and perfection and order, any worthwhile nationalist will not run timid from associating with it either and this extra-ordinary type of person is exactly what we need, when it comes to an organisation out of IM, unless you can back it up with Rockwell level dedication and bad assery than I've no problem flying it but that is a non issue ATM.  I like that slogan Quis, the effimate nature of many new generations of Australians is in stark contrast to our ancestors, you poor blokes must see this more in Melbourne haha hipster central, make a draft or something with pic collage &amp; phonto Quis with the imagery and that, Kalash will be able to improve it if your not a tech wiz. </p>
<p> will be travelling that way soon and would be fuckin awesome to catch up for some beers and plaster up some posters...also you blokes want an IM flag? I priced up 4 from Aussie flag makers And it's cheaper altogether to get a few more than one, I'd be happy to spot the cost and just send em out, use em as you wish. Also looking at making both Slavros and Kalash's designs into some gloss stickers, just got to find a place to get them made. </p>
