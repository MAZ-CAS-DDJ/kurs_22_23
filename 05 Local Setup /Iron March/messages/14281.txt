	Gosh, I hate baby boomers. And yeah, high-school was when they really kicked it into high gear. We had a holocaust survivor come talk to us in 8th grade, it was just weird to teach a child about a single isolated event an ocean away for two weeks every year. Elie Weisel came to a local school my junior year. My friends wanted to skip class and go see him. I laughed along with it but inside i was screaming ZOG 6 GORRILION REEEEEEE.Â

	My high school was in a wealthy area and everything was basically a crash course in How to Look Good on College Apps. Utterly useless.
