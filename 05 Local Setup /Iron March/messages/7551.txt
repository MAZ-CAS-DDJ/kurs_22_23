<p>WOW. That is amazing. It's beautiful words, I am going to save this!<br /><br />This is great. A few times I have wondered if this is worth the fight, being the only fascist in a city of athiest feminists... It is a question I have had only a few times, but listening to something like this blows those doubts right out of my mind. It's awesome. Thank you for translating this for me. I know how busy you are, so the time you took for this is a big deal to me.<br /><br />Translated songs are also a good way to help me learn Croatian! So it's double the gift! That was how I learned Swedish, I would download a song and listen to it over and over, every now and then reading the translation. It is not a bad way when I have limited internet and computer use.</p>
