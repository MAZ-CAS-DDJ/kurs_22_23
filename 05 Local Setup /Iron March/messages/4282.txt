<p>I'm very much interested in seeing what you have, I will say this I kind of dropped the MURRIKA, FUCK YEA! Imperialist stuff as you've seen in issue 4. I wrote the Manifestation of Destiny, I just forgot to use my penname XD. I'll think of what content I'm looking for, write now the next issue will talk about lot more about the Fascist worldview and alienation and I may draw on James Mason and CIV Collapse for inspiration. Tell me what your interests are as far as subjects is concerned and we'll come up with something.</p>
