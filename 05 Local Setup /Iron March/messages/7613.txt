<p>On my photo is Ciro Di Marzio, character from the series Gomorra, I posted about the series here: <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/4223-gomorra-tv-series-2014/" rel="">http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/topic/4223-gomorra-tv-series-2014/</a> Legendary character, I loved the show really much.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was my favourite scene involving this character, where he declares the war against his own boss. I love the Napolitan dialect and the atmosphere in this scene too.</p>

<p>Translation of what he's saying:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"That piece of shit. He [the boss of the clan] says that I'm a soldier, soldiers go to war only.</p>
<p>-Do you go to war alone?</p>
<p>Alone? Are you not with me?</p>
<p>-Of course I am.</p>
<p>At the orphanage the nuns used to say: earthquakes are the will of God, earthquakes are good for earth. They're like people who are unhappy; it gets worse and worse until it erupts... or cools off. Therefore the perfect earthquake is a good thing.</p>
<p>Call Danielino, tell him it's important."</p>

<p>As I said, great scene and great character, this show beats almost anything American. They captured the criminal aspect perfectly and the Napolitan way of talking really makes the series great.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The picture on my avatar is from the scene where he is forced to play Russian roulette in Spain while doing business for Camorra (Napolitan mafia) there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I always felt related to this organized crime shit in some way, because fascism is illegal here too. A lot of fascists feel the same way, though no one idolizes criminals obviously...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So what do you think about that nationalist, how was he like?</p>
