So no, I have not. It is rather down the list, although I am obviously a massive fan of Dr Goebbels. So I will get to it eventually, hopefully in a few months. Have you read it, or have you read Goebbels :Mastermind of the Third Reich?</p></div></div></blockquote>
<p>Not yet, I'm one of those people that likes their books in hard copies rather than pdfs, so I've been trying to hunt down Irving's book on Goebbels as well as the three volumes of the Goebbels diaries. I've read several of Goebbels speeches online though as well as his speeches: "Bolshevism in theory and practice" and "Communism with the mask off." Great stuff.</p>
