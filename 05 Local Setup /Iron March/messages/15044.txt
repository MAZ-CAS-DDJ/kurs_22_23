	Hey Odin.
</p>

<p>
	We are slowly starting our own group here in Denmark with AtomWaffen and National Action as what we look up to and what to become.
</p>

<p>
	But our paranoia has taken a hold of us and we are unsure if we can trust any new comrades. 
</p>

<p>
	How do AtomWaffen asure that its members are on the right course and not antifa in disguise?
