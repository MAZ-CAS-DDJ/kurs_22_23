<p>AWWW HAHAHAHAHAHAHA that is funny -- I was basically banned fo ra while there but luckily my foreign IP address, in the end, helped me get re-verified and let in. I had been accused of spam or some stuff</p>
<p>This site is not as active as it used to be but it's getting more lively</p>
<p>Liberal Degeneration is basically the greatest thread in the world <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>Being reported for spam is basically how shitlibs get you banned. Twitters asking for my number but I think I'll just make numerous more twitter accounts and go on a mass trolling campaign of bullycide and tears.</p>
<p>To be honest, I thought the fascist stuff was ironic. Don't get me wrong, I love the far right leaders of the Interwar Era, but it all seems too LARPy</p>
