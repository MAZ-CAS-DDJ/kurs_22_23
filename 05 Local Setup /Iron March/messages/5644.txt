<p>Yeah it is like somewhere between Europe and south Africa, but that isn't what I meant. I am already pretty desensitized and redpilled as they come, I just have a hard time understanding how white people can let things get to this point. Yes they suck at race, but having things work properly is a SWPL preoccupation - and the euro view of Americans is they lived a sheltered existence (example a lot of the tough guy stuff we get, like pimp my gun or whatever makes you look autistic, and there are are other stereotypes re therapists, tarot readers, and a whole 2 isles dedicated to 'medicine' all of which I have seen a lot of).  No it is more personal than that, I am picking up a lot of skills and education, this was a bold move to start with, and there have been many times when things have gone wrong.</p>

<p>For becoming a self sufficient activist America provides good training wheels. Torren pays all expenses, and you have the first amendment, which protects me from up to seven years in prison. We really really need some people with more balls back home, so I am going to grow them here.</p>

<p>And no, this is more an education in people and finding out if you are fake or not - Vienna,WW1, rather than an immense personal tragedy. </p>

<p>Torren feels he can trust you probably because you both didn't have the best start in life, and because you both have personal flaws and (I am guessing) secrets that would be so debilitating there is no way you would leak it. You kind of open up to people a lot and Torren fits the hole. My relationship is asymmetric - he admires me politically, and he recieves some validation if I respect him, and it is mutual in other ways.</p>

<p>When it comes to drugs I am kind of taking a scientific outlook - 'educational' or whatever - he offers them on the house but it is always different, and they are not anything I will need to take again. I was very impressed with Torren's set up and how little he has to work, and there are all kinds of uses these might have. If anyone ever druggs me up I will stand a much better chance to keep my mouth shut, and to not panic. I am not one of these fucking warhammer monks like Alex and Talleyrand, I like to drink sometimes which eliminates the whole 'straight edge' mentality kids have - in this case it is a prodical son thing. Straight edge is a noble sentiment, but it is mostly informed by ignorance (if you have heard straight edge talk about alcohol) - I want to know what I am talking about. I will talk about it another time, not here.</p>
