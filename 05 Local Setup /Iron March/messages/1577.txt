<p>I lost my job, been unable to find steady work before I leave for basic training. My wife has a job but it barely pays and we have one son to take care of. Has made eating right incredibly difficult but I get by on frozen fruits and vegetables instead of fresh. I 've had to heavily incorporate beans, rice, and pasta into my diet as they are coet efficient and are good at fedi g and filling up three people.</p>
<p>I wrestlednin high school and MMA. When I competed I wws at 205 and felt good there. After school my metabolism went crazy and I turned into a total lard ass. Luckilt was able to cut way down and am almost back to what I was then.</p>
<p>I am not sure if the so called warrior diet is going to be anymore than a fad. It looks interesting and I and more driven by curiosity than anything. Essentially it isnt about what you eat but when and how much. Basically, imagine ketosis from the carbohydrate curve all day and then in a four hour time period starting about six hours before bed you load up. Starting with vegetables, fruit, and nuts. Then protein. Then, carbs (rice, pasta, beans) etc. The portions should get subsequently smaller so like a really big salad with some side fruit and mixed nuts, followed by two chicken breasts and a hard boiled egg, and then a serving of chick peas or whole grain pasta. That is hypothetical. It stressing eating until you fill "satiated". The review I have read have been fom body builders who said they were losing weight and musicle definition and were getting leaner so they all hated it. I think bodybuilding is a joke though and think that humans are naturally lean with slight musculsr definition. Regardless their thoughts haven't  swayed me one way or the other.</p>
<p>Apologies for any typos. Typing this on my phone that has a virtual keyboard, long strings of texts are difficult to get correct.</p>
