<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Jacob introduced me to your Knights of Avalon movement, which is of interest to me especially as your planned "Avalon" would I'm sure encompass a good chunk of my western Canadian homeland. It's nice to see a good Christian movement as well, which brings me to my key point. What would be the attitude of you schismatics to any good Catholic folk living in your area?</p>

<p>I spent a tremendous amount of time anguishing over whether to become Catholic or Orthodox before settling on the latter. While there is no singular fuehrer of the project who can determine such things, my vision is one in which a definitively Orthodox government creates a welcoming environment for Catholics, Amish, and even skeptics who are not hostile to the Legion.</p>
<p>Ideally, of course, I hope for a reunification.</p>
