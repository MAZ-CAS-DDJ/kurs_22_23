	Hello, Florian.

	You were helpful last time with my question regarding Jews and how to go about the question in an Orthodox setting so I was wondering if perhaps you could help either come to terms or refute this article I stumbled upon tonight.

	I'll have to re-listen to the episode on Orthodoxy and Nationalism but it would seem that this article has gone ahead and quoted both scripture and councils to work against the notion of Nationalism being compatible with the Orthodox worldview. What are your thoughts on the article?
