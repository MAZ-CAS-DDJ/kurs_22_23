	That's a modest sentiment. I think I heard somewhere once that Romania has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe. I have a lot of respect for Romanians and your faith in God and Orthodoxy. Codreanu is one of my biggest influences too. My family hails from Poland and I've started to network with many people in Europe. Particularly in the East, countries like Romania, Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, etc. Its just Eastern Europeans have more in common, and we all still have faith in God and family. The West is very naive and many "New-Right" people want to make-believe as Pagans and worship false gods that indulge in homosexuality and barbarism. There is a few people on IM that I've networked with, but I'm interested in organizing sessions of training for people who want to defend their faith and country. I think Paramilitaries are fundamental to any legitimate Fascist or Nationalist group, not only for the purpose of Homeland defense, but to equip your brothers and fellow peoples with the correct skills and techniques to live off the land and to be able to prepare for the worst. I don't know if you have any type of outer military experience or hobbies, but you seem like a reasonable person. I am just looking to relay with people for the time being - as in exchanging ideas and situational reports. Sorta like a think-tank.
