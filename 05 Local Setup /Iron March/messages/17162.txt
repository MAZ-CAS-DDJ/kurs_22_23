	I didn't think they would, the antifa crowd seems to be so loud. Compensating for being weak it seems. Like all they talk about is violence, while i know what has to be done and will do it 10/10 times we dont make a fetish out of it like they seem to....The more someone talks about it the less they have actually done is what my veteran friends tell me and that is perfect representation of antifa. We want the whites to work together to build something great, they really just want a conflict they can not win.
