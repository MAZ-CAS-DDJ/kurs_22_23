<p>Hey nat, here's how to submit the tax form:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Go to this link: <a href="http://www.lulu.com/support?L1=1ma&amp;L2=1ma2t&amp;L3=1ma2t3iti" rel="external nofollow">http://www.lulu.com/support?L1=1ma&amp;L2=1ma2t&amp;L3=1ma2t3iti</a></p>
<p>2. Click "I still need help". This will open a support request form.</p>
<p>3. Attach the form to the support request and explain what you're doing in the "describe the problem" field.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That's it!</p>
