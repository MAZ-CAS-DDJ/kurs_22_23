<p>I live in a multi-ethnic country, and our cultural identity is very damage because of that, and i think that asians are as capable as white people, but africans and our natives( and i admit, i am  1/6 native) are ''retards''( lack of a better term). Thank God that i don't have any trait of them. My region is majoritary white, and we are the second most developed region of Brazil( behind SÃ£o Paulo, who has a lot of nazi-punks that i think they are stupid, they just fight, do not care about the national-socialist ideology) and many people that go to other regions say that our northeast, as exemple, is a dirty place, with a lot of poverty(there mestizos and blacks dominate) and they started migrating to our regions, so we felt invaded.</p>
