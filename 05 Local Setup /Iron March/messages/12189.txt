<p>No, we don't. But we're looking to really network with other like minded individuals. As for resources, we would love to assist in help for good materials and security measures. We are also going to be getting some resources and cash from the Ukrainian situation, so with hope, we can distribute that to help the IM guys in Canada and assist you guys with the gym and everything.</p>

<p>One thing I gotta recommend is to get all your guys to read SIEGE, if Mein Kampf is the Bible of National Socialism, then SIEGE is the bible of Fascist revolutionary action,organisational structure and measures to expand the organisation. This can be read from the Iron March archive, which is also something I wanted to bring up, it is superb because its filled with very valuable information and PDF files, ranging from political books to military PDF's.</p>

<p>Another thing I wanna recommend is to use Telegram or Tox instead of Skype for organisational procedures and meetings. These are really good ways of communicating, and I know of three NatSoc and Fascist organisations within the U.S that use these services because of their security. </p>

<p>In terms of really private messages always use PGP, National Action, a British Fascist organisation always uses PGP because of its encryption. Here's the said PDF made by IM's own Ben. </p>
