<p>Oregon can be very white, though i would advise the southern half of Oregon for the less liberal side of the state.  </p>

<p>i am part greek, though mostly Scottish and German. i have just always had a close relationship with the Greek part of my heritage, and i feel closely connected to the gods of ancient Greece.  </p>

<p>back to oregon, the town i live in, tri-city (its in douglas county, one of the larger counties in the state) in is more than 90% white, though recently theres been a small increase in the hispanic population, nothing much, just a family or 2</p>
