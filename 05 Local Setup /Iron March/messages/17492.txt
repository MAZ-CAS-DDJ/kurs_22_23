	I was actually studying computer science before, but unfortunately I dropped out. I wasn't struggling with the subject matter, but working on group projects was problematic for me. I'm not proud of that, but I got myself quite a decently-paying job (train driver) in the end so at least I rescued myself. I won't be getting a degree and a career in this field anymore, but I found programming an interesting subject during the brief period I was studying it, and I might try to learn it by myself.

	I speak Dutch and English. As it happens I'm somewhat of a musician too: I own a piano, accordion and a synthesizer. And I enjoy nature-based activities as well. I'm not trying to mimic you here, I'm serious.

	There is a Kurmanji course offered at a college in Amsterdam or Utrecht. That's where I can start. I would describe the Kurdish community here as not very active in proportion to its size. There are many families here such as mine which have left Kurdish culture behind and seek to integrate into Dutch society, or came here too Turkified to begin with. Kurds that uphold their identity and are active members of the community here are a minority.Â  The majority BTW are from Bakur, and a minority are from Bashur. The PKK has politically dominated the Kurdish community here, all demonstrations and gatherings are PKK oriented and most of the politically conscious/active Kurds here support the PKK.

	I know who Julius Evola is but I haven't yet acquainted myself with his ideas or read his work. All the political theory I've read so far has been "materialist" so I guess it's time to step out of my comfort zone.

	Our vision for Kurdistan is a pretty extensive subject. It's 3:45 AM here and I need to go to sleep now - I'll be online tomorrow again to discuss it.

	Take care my friend.
