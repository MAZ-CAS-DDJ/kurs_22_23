<a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/645-oswald-spengler/page__hl__spengler__fromsearch__1" rel="">http://ironmarch.org...__fromsearch__1</a><p>My only criticism is that you misunderstood Spengler's rejection of Darwinism. He simply thought that evolution is guided by destiny but not determined by causality. Goethian Evolution vs Darwinism. The former a moral fulfillment unless I was misinformed. The latter Spengler thought was mired by Anglo-Saxon capitalistic/viking thinking - essentially - every man for himself.</p>

<p>Causality is tied to destiny through the dialectical process. Spengler put down Americans, and wasn't the first European conservative thinker to do so. what these sorts of old new right and archaic ancient new right predecessor people skrew over seriously is their commitment to hierarchy and traditional social institutions for the sake of itself, which isn't far removed from mainstream conservatism; ie the defense of base familiarities for motives (racial, sexual) that are beyond them in the first place, and must be concealed. Basically he had a grudge against American employ of modern state faculties and modern values because what was happening was America tore up the rule book, and maneuvered itself in a way that only paid homage to its own virtue and its own interests. Not that different from the English, except perhaps more brutal, and more efficient and therefore less cultured (or 'faceless' as these people would call it. call me crazy, but I think the Germans are a little more of a monolith.)</p>
<p>In the case of Germany, Spengler spectacularly embraces this sort of modern statecraft as long as it is 'socialist' in Germany, in lots of his works, Prussianism and Socialism places emphasis on the sort of state values and Hour of Decision on the urgency of the time. Germans are distinct among Europe, because they are a 'young people.' So it should come no surprise that Spengler envies youth, which is why he envies Americans. He is right in his assessment that the American state and civil society is rooted in decadence and liberalism, but wrong in his assessment that these mean a total downfall of Americans as a race; at least no more than it already has in all the other peoples of Europe.</p>
<p>The truth is Germans, Russians, Americans, English etc share a sort of 'liberalism' because we are Nordic. In the words of HP Lovecraft "The primal savage or ape merely looks about his native forest to find a mate; the exalted Aryan should lift his eyes to the worlds of space and consider his relation to infinity"; take this raw, masculine energy, 'tradition' as Evola called it, and place it in the context of a worldview that makes sense given the conditions of modern technology and modern statecraft, and you will have little place for 'traditionalist' social institutions. Spengler takes this into account when he calls himself a 'socialist', which is why his condemnation of Americans makes little sense, but he remains an excellent source of thought. For a latin of somekind, yeah, 'liberalism' will always fundamentally be based on decadence, since his lifeblood is the catholic faith and its direct instruction, but here in the North, well, we just have different values.</p>
<p>As for Russia, Spengler's own lack of involvement and his face-value approach is probably his greatest strength. Especially memorable is his line 'Russia is moving away from Tolstoy and towards Dostoyevsky.' He recognized, in a way a very select few philosophers that I have read understand;</p>
<p>How to do with law in a lawless society.</p>
<p>Russia's disparate, uncertain, and divided elite.</p>
<p>Russia's elite and Russia's people as a culture forced on another.</p>
<p>Russian urban-peasant spirit.</p>
<p>These are all basically essential elements in Russian literature and philosophy yet so few westerners can seem to get a grasp on it. You cannot expect or hope for him to understand Russians, and if he tried, it would hurt his face-value analysis. Not even we can do that.</p>
