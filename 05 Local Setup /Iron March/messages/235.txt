<p>I'm just the one who set up the current site, Kacen set up the previous incarnation, the ITPF, otherwise it is collective adminship effort so I don't call it "mine".</p>
<p>As for some promotional video - I wanted us to do that since ITPF. Would do best to probably go with some classic martial-industrial tune and choose something very upbeat and march-like. <strong><em>Bellum Sacrum Bellum </em></strong>and <strong><em>Ius ad Bellum Ius et in Bello</em></strong> by <strong>Von Thronstahl</strong> comes to mind. Otherwise it all depends on what theme or concept you pursue, any song can work. I had an idea for a video using a hippy song of the 60s and twisting it's meaning to our cause, not that I am suggesting you use some pop song, just providing an example to the method - idea/concept first, and then look for music that fits it.</p>
<p>And about youtube accounts: we have established an official Iron March channel on Youtube which is where, at the very least, such videos should exist in duplicate to what you upload to your own channel, so you'll have to send the video either to me or Kacen. Or just upload it to your channel and I'll download it via a program and upload it on the off. channel.</p>
