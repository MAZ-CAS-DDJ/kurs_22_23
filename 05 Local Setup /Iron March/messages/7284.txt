<p>Right on, I got a copy of "Revolt Against the Modern World" and i'm reading that as of right now.</p>

<p>Iv'e skimmed through the protocols and a few times iv'e read specific sections all the way through, but it's just too boring over all to read from start to finish, in my opinion. A great book that discusses the Jews would have to be "Bolshevism: From Moses to Lenin" by Dietrich Eckart. It's short, but it'll keep your attention. That is, if you haven't read it already.</p>
