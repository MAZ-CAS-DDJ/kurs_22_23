<p>I might post something about it in "Nederlandse herstel beweging".</p>
<p>When I speak of Dutch National Socialism I mostly refer to so called "Mussertism"; the ideas of Anton Mussert, the leader of the Dutch NSB. The NSB is an interesting topic to study, when it was founded the only thing that was national socialist about it was the party structure and the name. It barely mentioned race or Jews and Dutch East-Indians and Dutch Jews were proud members of it. In fact, over seas in Dutch East India the NSB was the third largest party. Economically they were corporatist.</p>
<p>Anton Mussert and his branch of National Socialism favoured Dutch independence and Dutch culture, while parties like the NSNAP (Nationaal Socialistische Nederlandse Arbeiders Partij= National Socialist Dutch Workers Party) used slogans like "Nederduits weder Duits!";"Nethergermany must be German again!". They wanted to annex us in the Third Reich. Such ideas, as you can imagine, weren't really popular.</p>
<p>By the mid/late 1930's Rost Van Tonningen joined the NSB and he quickly got more and more influence within the NSB. Rost Van Tonningen was, in contrast to Mussert, a more pro-German national socialist. He was more radical if it came to subjects like race and Jews, these ideas, however, were not so popular so the popularity of the NSB slowly decreased. I mostly use him as the prime example of "Germanic/German National Socialism".</p>
<p>Then everything changed because the Germans invaded us and made the NSB the only legal party. Membership reached an all time peak in 1943. Mussert had to make loads of concessions to the Germans, in order to stay in favour. The party started to do simply what the Germans wanted. Every time Mussert protested something the Germans threatened to replace him with Rost. Meanwhile Musserts own ideas didn't remain unchanged either. He started to believe Adolf Hitler was send by god to create a Greater Germanic empire. Mussert envisioned this Empire to consist of independent states working closely together. He presented the idea to Hitler who simply ignored it. He had at the moment better things to do, and simply didn't care.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mussert tried to convince the Germans that the Dutch SS  recruits (we had our own SS) should swear an oath to the Netherlands and Mussert, and he in turn would pledge allegiance to Adolf Hitler. Mussert took the oath, but the Dutch SS ended up still pledging loyalty to Hitler. This is the prime reason he was convicted for treason after the war, and he was executed.</p>
<p>As you can see, the ideas of Mussert changed somewhat over time, but when I speak of "Mussertism" I mostly refer to his pre-war ideas. Back during the war, the difference between these two national socialisms was made by using a dash in between the two words. "Nationaal-Socialisme" was Mussertism and "Nationaal Socialisme" was Germanic/German NS.</p>
<p>I hope this clears some things up, if you still have questions feel free to ask them. If you are interested I can also supply you with images and videos. I also have copies and scans of original documents but they are all in Dutch so I doubt you can read them.</p>
