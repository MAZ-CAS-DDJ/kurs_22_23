	I do not mind any place in particular, the Metro seems easy enough to understand. I am by Ploschad Ilicha, but I can just go to wherever you find it convenient.

	As for the timing, I've actually just arrived and will go to sleep now, I suppose I'll wake up around 12 so that the day is not wasted, then I'll open this and check this out, and you can pretty much dictate the terms as it would not be fair for me to tell you where and when to meet, with things already being of such short notice.
