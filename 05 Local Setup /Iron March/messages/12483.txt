<p>I've listened to a few but I'm not too familiar with them, I'll have to look I to it. Yeah you might be right, I heard pope Francis has been fishy too. One of his female secretaries got pregnant then died mysteriously. Hardly holy</p>
<p>The only pagan groups in my area go out to the city park to do festivals and they're all unhealthy and allow non-whites to worship thor and odin. So embarassing...I usually don't talk to anyone who calls themselves pagan and prefer worshiping on my own. Do you pray still? In what ways do you pray?</p>
<p>I'm mostly germanic (german, dutch, norwegian) but I have some celtic too, not sure as to percentages. I've usually just identified as german cause of my looks and upbringing.</p>
