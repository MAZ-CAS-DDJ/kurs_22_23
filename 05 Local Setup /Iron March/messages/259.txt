<p>Hello Lightning Sun,</p>
<p>I already had the impression that some people of Socialist Phalanx where also engaged in the discussions here. I'm the same person, I found this forum by a tip from another poster here on our facebook account.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://derdeweg.blogspot.com" rel="external nofollow">collective </a>is made up from corporatists/solidarists, revolutionairy-syndicalists, national-revolutionaries/bolshevists and some more "mainstream" nationalists. Therefore the corporatist versus syndicalist discussion is very interesting to me, especcially because in I can find good and convincing standpoints in both ideological manifestations. </p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>NSP/Nationaal-Syndicalist</p>
