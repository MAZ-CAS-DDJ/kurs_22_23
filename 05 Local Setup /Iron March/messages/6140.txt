<p>Yes, I agree that OE is better. This isn't a bad forum in my opinion but an all out neo-Nazi theme looks cartonish and unserious. It's as if these guys are historical reenactors larping the 1930s.</p>
<p>And yes, I'm Joe McCarthy over there. I saw your messages there too. My Comtean leanings and my nick here are unrelated.</p>
