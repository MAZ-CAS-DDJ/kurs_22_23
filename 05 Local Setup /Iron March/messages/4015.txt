<p>Agreed, the internet plays a part, but a majority of the work has to be done on the ground. I"m not too familiar with Australian politics but here the more right wing you get the more libertarian you are. We don't have much of a history of fascism in this country. Other than a couple of small groups in the 30's there's nothin. The road is going to be long and tough but I think we can do it.</p>
<p>As far as music goes i'm a big power metal fan. Manowar is my favorite, I also like Blind Guardian, Iron Savior, and Gamma Ray and many more.</p>
