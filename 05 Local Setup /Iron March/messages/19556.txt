	Stop being edgy , leaving america to fight in some shit holes war gets me arrested or death not the way I wanted to, by the way I don't speak any other language so eh.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah I am above time because my other option is just suicide, it's always been there when I get no hope at all for anything. 
</p>

<p>
	I already despise society and humans , I hate humanity and society I don't want to be a part of it.
</p>

<p>
	The establishment of fascism was a mistake , when I was 15 Hitler made sense to me a perfect society the removal of all the people that made society bad. Now I see society is bad regardless of its time and place.
</p>

<p>
	Humanity is bad , the self is bad
</p>

<p>
	all the fear , anger , hatred ,love , sadness , happiness , its all meaningless it drives people to act everyday but it all means nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Once you remove the veil over your eyes of Hope of emotion of society you'll see that man is an animal a filthy creature with the mind of a god cursed with self awareness.
</p>

<p>
	All I have is to look forward to death I want my death to be after I have found inner peace ,the goal I have is to free myself from all of my emotions , my fellow humans and society as a whole.
