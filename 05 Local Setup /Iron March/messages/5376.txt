<p>Not sure if "Leo"'s comment warrants an honest reply along the lines of "You forget the origin of the symbol if the poppy  from 11/11/18 and the Mosley flash to the honest, national, Brit" or a sarcastic one along the lines of "You forget to add in 'Sand-niggers' " or no comment at all.  What do you think? I am still working on getting the nuances of this forum.</p>
