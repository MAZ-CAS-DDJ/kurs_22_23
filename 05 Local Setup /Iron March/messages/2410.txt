<p>I am usually very leniant, I am the one responsible for ensuring contributive people get back on the forum, that included you. When it comes to the mentally ill though the response must be firm. These people can never be reasoned with or stopped unless you stop them early.</p>

<p>I hope this explains things.</p>
