<p>I talked to James today and asked him what he thought about Eurasianism being an American. His reply was thus:</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="339" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Well our vision of the Eurasian "Empire" is less important than the Eurasians own vision certainly. They spell this out on the Eurasian Movement's website and elsewhere - evrazia.info is a good place to start - as well as comrade Dugin's work on openrevolt.info. We support a strong, united Eurasia as a key point in the establishment of a multi-polar world - which would then make our own national ambitions much more likely to obtain. What weakens the beast strengthens us - especially when the opposition to the beast we are discussing are our closest allies.</div></blockquote>

<p>I believe the articles cleared up a lot for me, and I believe the concept is more about maintaining a multi-polar world as opposed to a uni-polar world.</p>
