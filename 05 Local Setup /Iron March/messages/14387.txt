			Yeah, my personal skype account is different from my ironmarch one, so that's a good call there. It's unfortunate that the music world is so heavily dependant on personal connections; I have to watch what I say in public and not "out" myself entirely .... at least not yet. I hope that one day when my income and career is firmly established, I can speak out as openly as I want to on the issues that matter, like Wagner did or what Varg Vikernes does now (Varg is a black metal musician from Norway who's awesome and runs his own blog/youtube channel where he talks about traditionalism and about pagan philosophy). By the way, what would you consider your religious beliefs to be?

	In public I'm just a "traditionalist conservative" who also is economically a bit populist. Basically a Buchananite type. I even thought of myself that way until very recently, seeing how much it's failed at halting cultural degradation.<br /><br />
	I'm familiar with Varg, by the way. ;) I think some black metal can be very atmospheric and beautiful.<br /><br />
	I was raised Russian Orthodox, and still have an appreciation for it. It does a very good job at holding the community together and promoting healthy social values. But honestly, what I value in it is the stuff it took from paganism, and I can understand the "Christian universalist values lead to liberalism" argument a lot of pagans make. So I've looked into Rodnovery and Wodenism a tiny bit.
