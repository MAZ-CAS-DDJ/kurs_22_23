<p>Hi, nice to see that there are other Catholics here too.</p>
<p>Here's something you might like. Some guy I know collected these pictures, they represent Catholic-<em>Fascist</em> aesthetics of my country (Slovenia) before the Bolshevik revolution in 1945:<br /><br /><a href="http://legija-ahaca.tumblr.com/" rel="external nofollow">http://legija-ahaca.tumblr.com/</a><br /><br />Really cool collection. On the pics there are processions, the traditions, the landscape, Catholic symbolism, Catholic movements, Home Guard movement ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_Home_Guard" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_Home_Guard</a> ) fighting Bolsheviks during WWII, symbols of our past in Habsburg empire etc. The banner with Christ on one side and "Fir das Vaterland" on the other is from the battle against the Turks at Sisak in 1593, the famous victory. This is how a healthy nationalistic traditionalist Catholic society looks like. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We were one of the most religious parts of Europe before the Bolsheviks came to power.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most people here simply don't understand how Catholicism (or Orthodoxy) is intertwined with everything that was healthy and good in politics and society.</p>
