<p>
	I have started to systematically read through some topics here, and I found a lot of articles in the <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/forum/81-ell%C3%A1da/" rel="">Ell√°da</a> forum containing only outdated links by the member <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/2623-plethon/&amp;do=hovercard" data-mentionid="2623" href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/2623-plethon/" rel="">@Plethon</a>. I don't know if you Black Corps guys are deleting this kind of shit or not, tell me if I should drop you another message if I find more useless stuff. Keep IM clean and fashy!
