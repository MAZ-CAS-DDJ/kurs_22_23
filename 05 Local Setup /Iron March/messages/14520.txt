	Sorry for late answer, been pretty busy in last days.<br /><br />
	1. As far as I know, Poles in Lithuania can't have bilingual schools or can't use their languages in local offices and departments in regions, where they have majority (even in f.e. Soleczniki/Salcininkai county, where we have about 90% of population), though Lithuanians in Poland, while being very small minority comparing to whole country population, have both in counties, where they have at least 20%, and also bilingual names of towns and streets. So, this problem must be solved, that both groups in both countries should have same rights.<br />
	Also, the autonomy project of local Poles from the beginning of 90' was illegally crushed and there were some cases of seizing land by Lithuanians from other parts of the country in Vilnius region. Anyway, we should find some solution thay would please both Poles and Lithuanians and it all should be settled in something like new Polish-Lithuanian agreement about relations beetween our countries. After this, we can engage in further dialogue about long-term forms of regional cooperation.<br /><br />
	2. C'mon, gib union. :3<br /><img alt="h8QcmQI.png" class="ipsImage" src="http://i.imgur.com/h8QcmQI.png" /><br />
	But seriously, if we want to achieve this we should focus on improving our armies and economics, cooperating tightly in political, economical and military aspects and try to remain neutral, as USA and Russia are making some provocations in region.<br /><br />
	3. Well, we are doing pretty much the same.<br /><br />
	Are you inspired by some historical movements, like Gele≈ºnis Vilkas? What's your opinion on Antanas Smetona and Augustinas Voldemaras?
