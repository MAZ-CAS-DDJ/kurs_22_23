<p>Don't see why I should do that.</p>

<p>So you're ignorant of the language as well. One drop rule is a racialist concept that even if you have one drop of any blood that isn't Aryan then you're no longer Aryan, we use it mockingly here.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="935" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Anyways, this totally isn't relevant to you, nor do you / nor should you care.</div></blockquote>
<p>Note how you try to make a point of your supposed imaginary lineage later on to prove some apparent value of your presence here contradicting your point here.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="935" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div> Moving on; we may have absolute contempt for one another, and I still consider you a brainwashed Stalinist peasant, but I'm still a dedicated Fascist and a promoter of this forum.</div></blockquote>
<p>Don't know how you're a "dedicated fascist" when your signature clearly states that you support: freedom of sexuality, anarchism, materialism, intellectualism. Are you sure you know what Fascism is? Do you remember how this went over in your introduction posts? You're not really blending in with the community.</p>
<p>And right back at you, delusional kid that lived in an imaginary bubble of supposed nobility. See it's how you constantly use the word peasant that brings up me questioning your lineage in the first place also countering your point about how it supposedly it shouldn't matter to me. Stop trying to push it on everyone and then you won't get shit handed back at you, serf.</p>

<p>Ah, well no dice then.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="935" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>but it's better to retain some sort of truce</div></blockquote>
<p>I don't see any upside to that. My personal opinion is that you're a sperg that should get the hell out of here, but contrary to popular opinion I don't ban people silly-nilly and consult such questions with other admins because I do maintain that I don't run this forum solo.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="935" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>otherwise the only other option is for me to start a forum of my own,</div></blockquote>
<p>Bye bye, good luck with that.</p>

<p>Movement?</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="935" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div> This sort of decentralization wouldn't be beneficial for anyone.

<p>Also strength through excluding the weak, a term that also encompasses spergs, and you're practically there.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="935" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div> It's up to you, whether you want more Fascists loyal to the IMF or not.

<p>This forum is not a movement you imbecile. How many times does this need to be said? From the charter:</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="935" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>
<strong>III. </strong><strong><span style="color:#ff8c00">Community</span></strong><p>Iron March is not a movement</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And read <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/711-ironmarch-y-u-no-maek-movement/page__view__findpost__p__21627" rel="">this topic</a>.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="935" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a person of my blood be a member, am I right, or am I right? I think I've my case. Potential good publicity is potential good publicity.</div></blockquote>
<p>And here's where you fuck up your own point about how I shouldn't care for your lineage.</p>
<p>You are like FasCap if he were bragging about his supposed noble lineage rather than him being a successful businessman. Guess how that <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/1196-formal-petition/" rel="">worked out for him</a>.</p>
<p>He also has a spiffy membership title, yay!</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the deal: this is IronMarch - take it or leave it; this is IronMarch - if you're a sperg we'll get rid of you. So do what you want but if you decide to stay then some attitude adjustment might be in order.</p>
