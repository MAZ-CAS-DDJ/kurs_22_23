<p>Thank you. Well, to start of I am a very liberal person when it comes to social issues. For the most part anyway. I believe in the authoritarian defense when it comes to these issues. However, I have a great admiration for things like Fascist economic and military policies. Syncretic Nationalism is about utilizing both the freedom that any democratic government can give, while still using Fascism to make citizens give back to the state and keeping a balance.</p>
<p>There is a lot more if you are interested. But I am better at being asked questions. So if you like, ask away.</p>
