<p>Well still, I am a bit of a pariah. Humour is also sometimes lost in the internet if it isn't a meme. And I've shot myself in the foot a few times.</p>
<p>It is also difficult to be German and admire NS (mainly as an economic and social model) but also admire Israel. I think it is viewed as mutually exclusive, and I could only care about one of these nations. Or my like of Christianity is treated with suspicion by Christians.... Ironically also by many Jews.</p>
<p>You would think since fascism is marginalized, there would be broader visions and interpretations of it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I like basically all of your views and posts. What do you use as the foundation of your philosophy? What is neo-federalism?</p>
