<p>I would love for the whole national socialism ideal to be painted in a better light, but it's unfortunate that it is currently upheld by total skinhead racists. </p>
<p>You are right though, all the affluent members have seen the lower classes as dispensable and replaced them with immigrants, because pity's makes rich people feel better.</p>
<p>In the UK it's not much different, now you have a mixture of class and culture all scrambling for money in the welfare state.</p>
<p>Personally I don't think upfront totalitarianism works, every government today provides a soft version of the far right. They chop away very slowly at morals, thought and actions.</p>
