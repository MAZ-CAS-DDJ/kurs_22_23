	Hey there!
</p>

<p>
	I asked <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/14140-suburbanpride_14/&amp;do=hovercard" data-mentionid="14140" href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/14140-suburbanpride_14/" rel="">@SuburbanPride_14</a> about a Kurdish guy and he said that I should contact you instead for he is not a full member of AW yet. So there is this Kurd I know from IM and who I was talking with through literal walls of texts (~50.000 words so far). He is really into the Esoteric stuff and also very action-oriented, but since he recently disappointed in the Kurdish Nationalist agenda and thus left their movement he is not sure what to do next. The guy wants to organize in Kurdistan and since at the moment he lives in the U.S. East Coast we figured that he should look up AW to learn. He doesn't have high hopes for becoming a member because he is from the Middle East (not a Muslim though), but maybe there are other ways for him to collaborate with you.

	What do you say?
