	You're fine. This time of year is pretty hectic for me as well.

	Yeah I felt the same way. It's a really open access community too. That doesn't mean there isn't an orthodoxy of thought here though. There's right and there's wrong and nothing else. Our worldview is that fascism is the recognition of a struggle between our racial values and the forces of disunion and death. These forces clash throughout history. The biggest influences on my worldview were Evola and Alfred Rosenburg. Rosenburg talks a lot about those two forces in his book The Myth of The 20th Century. I'll send you this great documentary which is a reading of it.
