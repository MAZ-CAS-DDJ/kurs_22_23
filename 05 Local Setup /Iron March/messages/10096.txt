<p>If youre interested in the common roots of Paganism, I hate to keep harping on about it, but early Hinduism man. You will be amazed at how similar it is to Paganism, it really should be considered "East" Paganism. Odin and Lugh, for example? In Hinduism there is a god known as Varna (I might have the name wrong but its like that) who rules over the land of the dead with a great spear. He has 2 dogs with 4 eyes that guard the realm of the dead and bring the souls of the valiant to his domain. This is exactly the same as the Valhalla aspect of Odin. </p>

<p>Dogs guarding the gates to the afterlife is a very common European theme, think Cerberus or Garm. Not to mention many of the old sacrificial rituals of the Aryan Hindus resemble Pagan sacrifice very heavily, especially their horse ones</p>

<p>I believe studying history is connected to Pagan spirituality honestly, you cant fully understand a ethnic religion unless you know its people and their story. If you want to read about the Germans I would recommend Germania; as far as the Gauls I don't know much, I've only just started researching them heavily. </p>
