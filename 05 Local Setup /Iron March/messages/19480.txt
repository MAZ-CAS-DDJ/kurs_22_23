	Nah mate it's not the mods I'm concerned about, it's journos such as HNH who are actively using this forum for info now, I'm just concerned something I've said in the past could cause problems for a new group I'm involved with. Trying to avoid legal hassle for myself and other people.

	Its probably a bad idea anyway, I'm sure one of them will make a big deal out of it, rendering it pointless. It's maybe better if I'm just gassed or whatever

	Apologies for bothering you with thus shite, I dont think anyone appreciates how careful we have to be in the UK now but I hope you understand, many of my friends are facing jail, potentially for a very long time based on mere crap they've said online.
