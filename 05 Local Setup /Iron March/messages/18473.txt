	Slow, at the moment I don't have access to a computer so all my reading is being done on my phone.  Read the articles on Trumpcucks and The Fag Agenda on Ropeculture, just started the futurism workshop.  Also discovered the Iron March library, just started downloading some of the Originals now.  Lots of info, lots to learn as I'm finding out.
