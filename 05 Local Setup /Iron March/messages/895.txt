<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Hello, folks! Will try to keep this as brief as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">I am 18 years old Lithuanian. My political views are leaning closest towards nationalism and traditionalism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">I support NATO and EU while at the same time stand against any kind of cooperation or political pacts with our big greedy Eastern neighbour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">This person I choose for my avatar is Lithuanian general Povilas Plechaviƒçius. Best known for kicking Russians/Germans out of lowland region of Lithuania back in the WW1 days, and organising short-lived Lithuanian crewed and commanded defence force to defend Lithuania from Russians during WW2, since nobody really wanted to join SS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">So that's that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Cheers.</span></p>
<p></p>

<p>Now it's shorter. Should fit.</p>
