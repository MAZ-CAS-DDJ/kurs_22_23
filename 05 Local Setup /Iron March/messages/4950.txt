<p>It's a form of national syndicalism that puts the organic unity of the nation above all things. Everything - regionalism, language, race - comes second to the authority of the State. The State only exists to serve the needs of the nation. In the modern sense race has become more important to Falangism, but only in areas where racialism promotes the unity. I'd imagine most Falangists are opposed to the Nordicism of the National Socialists and subscribe to a wider, more inclusive European identity within the context of their particular nation. There's a whole section dedicated to Falangism on the forum.</p>
