<p>I just saw your thread "A time to Kill". Up until recent years I'd have called myself an Athiest, however this was before I got into politics or anything.</p>
<p>I've been raised a Catholic (Like every Irish person in my country) and have been 'confirmed' into the Catholic Church. I've decided I'm going to finally actually learn as much as I can about Christianity and decide where I stand on my own, I just have a quick question.</p>
<p>You seem to know what you're talking about, and I was wondering where the hell I should start. I'm not sure if I should start with the Old Testament or New Testament (if they're even a good place to start). Is there any book you'd recommend reading first?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
