<p>No .</p>
<p>I'm in favor of Hajmal policy it was the best option to germany at that time and the we could start to emphase more on Socialism instead of supporting big bussiness .</p>
<p>Big Industries like Krup should  be put on the handsof the State but Hitler had an agreement with those guys and make them more rich witth all those investments on Military .</p>
<p>Even when he was at war the consumer goods are being produced more than military until 1943 so how can he want to win the war without invest more on army ?</p>
