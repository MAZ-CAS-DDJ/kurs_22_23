<p>Your posts are fucking phenomenal. Absolutely great. I am a big fan.</p>
<p>Do you blog or anything?</p>
<p>I do not think that I am as hardline as many on the site about racial issues, but I am certainly race conscious, but more than anything, I am very much interested into achieving a great cultural society.</p>
<p>This is particualrly why I have a mass vehemence against sexual deviants, drug addicts and Traitorous Liberals, and it shows.</p>
<p>I am curious... What do you think of us whites who, by twists of fate, end up in Asia or wherever? Who just have been ended up with lots of close friendships and brotherhood with non-whites? I have a lot to say abotu it and want to hear your thoughts.</p>
<p>really good work and keep posting. Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm pretty fine with asians. I think asians and whites are a bit different in temperament, but at the end of the day we both have the same amount of neanderthal mixture, branched off from each other more recently than we did from blacks, and (east asians at least) spent time adapting to similar selective pressures. So it makes sense why asians and whites can get along pretty well. There's no problem with it. I think whites should be friendly with asians, just realize that they both should have their respective homelands secure. </p>
