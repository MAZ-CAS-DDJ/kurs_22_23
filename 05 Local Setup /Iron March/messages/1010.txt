<p>My printer etc. is on the shitter at the moment.</p>
<p>I was thinking of picking certain articles because of their relevance and forwording them such as 'Defeated militarily, but not spiritually' and 'corporate state' from intro to fascism. Obv i'll edit them a little so the articles are more revelent to current times or place.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, im going to start writing shit up now.</p>
