<p>I think that's the problem with many Americans. They don't really have a real fascist tradition. For me, what attracted me to fascism is the living tradition of my Catholic people. For example, this is what I used to have as avatar here: <a href="http://outinslovenija.blog.siol.net/files/2011/09/smarna-gora.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://outinslovenija.blog.siol.net/files/2011/09/smarna-gora.jpg</a> It's Šmarna Gora near Ljubljana (the city I'm from), it's a church that was used as a fortress against Turkish invaders and every sunday at 7AM the bells still ring to remember our Christian heroes who fought against our "eternal enemies". There were such church-fortresses all over our country.</p>

<p>This is the church in St. Urh near Ljubljana:</p>

<p>It was used by the Home Guards (Catholic collaborators with the Nazis who fought against commie scum) and you can still the damage made by commie bullets. We Catholics used to say in our country<em> - centuries ago the Turks, now the Bolshevik scum</em>. We used churches as fortresses against commies just like we did against Turks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the interwar period we had Catholic fascist-like (corporativist) movements like Straža (The Guard) and Mladci Kristusa Kralja (Youth of Christ the King) who gave their lives in anti-commie struggle, more than 60% of them died.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the real Catholic heritage of Catholic Europe, not some random American Catholics supporting who knows what.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is how I fell in love with both Catholicism and fascism and I'm proud of my ancestors who fought for same ideals. It's in my blood as I said, I was born into this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now some American kid who is a fascist for a year after he read some shit on the internet insults my heritage....</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These American NS, many of them I see on the internet seem to be drawn into this ideology because of either some intelectuall fascination or because they need some agressive ideology to be "tough guys". There are a lot of people of the latter type on this forum, that's why there's this obsession to prove that you're not an "autist", the fitness threads, the quasi anti-intellectual "Hitler is a saint" arguments when their childish obsession about Hitler is confronted - you see, Hitler is not really their legacy because they're not Germans, it's more like he's their childhood hero. I don't see any sincerity and passion in this infantile fascism, only insecurity. I see right through this bullshit because I know so many real fascists in real life and they would never act like this on internet because they have nothing to prove to anyone.</p>
