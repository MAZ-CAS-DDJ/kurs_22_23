<p>Politically, they are messed up as usual.</p>
<p>We have a so called conservative party with super majority that can do whatever it pleases.</p>
<p>The opposition parties are mainly liberal of a kind they are still worried about "fascists".</p>
<p>It is "nice" to see ex communist party members defending capitalism and our rights.</p>
<p>Beside that we have a cool weather, life is good here for me.</p>
<p>Still no job, of course.</p>
<p>For you?</p>
