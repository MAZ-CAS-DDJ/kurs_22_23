<p>I have to agree. I respect Asian values a lot. And I am glad to see that they are rising to challenge the Western hegemony. The problem is that they are too westernized in the long run. For example Japan got from a nation of never surrendering to a nation that doesn't breed because people are afraid to talk to each other. It's funny to see how MGTOWs say this is a good thing when it is basically the fact that they got into Beta males combined with their over stressed life to work.</p>

<p>Yes. Facebook and other sides are dangerous. There were many news that people lost their jobs over basically nothing. ie drinking on vacation and so on. Imagine if somebody has real alternative views that are not the socially accepted leftism ie anarchy or libertarianism. People are vain and narcissistic. Especially people who have nothing real to provide. I miss the times when internet wasn't about building identity but rather what could people give to their community. In many ways I see this popularity contest combined with mainstreamisation of the internet. Just look at the level of content of popular youtubers...</p>

<p>I think they lack a world view of their own so they don't understand things or simply go for the easy routes ie. conspiracy theories and mainstream politics but if you notice it people rarely have an oversee over their own politics. They usually vote at face value. ie. nobody cared about what Obama will or won't do, all they care about is the hip image that is being manufactured and the fact that he is Black. Thanks to that he can't do no wrong to liberal medial.</p>

<p>I am having a really filtered view on the world in this case. I don't follow day to day Hungarian politics or happenings. It is worthless stuff but I like to look at the big picture it is interesting and it's where the history is being made. Not in reps arguing about nothing and dramaing about facebook posts or "being offended by antismitism" etc. We have to accept that in the big picture small people stuff is worthless that is why I am not being angry at the "liberal degeneration" at least most of the time.</p>

<p>I really dislike that fashion. It just makes me wish I was born a hundred years ago when men looked like men and done men stuff.</p>

<p>Well if we look into old traditions they usually talk about a balance between the good and bad part of us. Even Christianity have the flesh and the soul separate. I think it is referring to our civilization/values and our animal nature being balanced. Nowadays we totally lost the soul and people are simply walking towards their own pointless destruction thanks to hedonism and nihilism. I mean we had generations of people who simply couldn't save up a dime and didn't made no thinking choice about life. People just buy stuff they don't need from money they don't have to please a crowd that doesn't really care.</p>

<p>One can win a fight but never win in surrender. That's for sure.</p>
