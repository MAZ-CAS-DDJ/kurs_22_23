<p>I like that link, and agree with essentially everything he said. I shall explore this further. </p>
<p> The problem many people here have is they are like being Fascist, but they are not interested in having Fascism. They talk about how Jews are evil, and are surprised when they become liberal anti Fascists. </p>
<p>They are not interested in progressing Fascism in the real world. </p>
<p>In my opinion, Jews have been ready for Fascism for a long time. The liberal establishment is not against anti semitism, it only works in its own interests to destroy a group's identity. Christian liberals are not going to respond to the Muslim threat as much, but Jews may because of their experience in the Middle East (which is why Israelis like the Lebanese and Egyptian Christians. They both understand what is going on). </p>
<p>Most of them want to work with Christians. When Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III protected Jews and allowed them to work with Christians, they wrote religious hymns praising him. My grandfater's friend is nearly 90. He talks about the Austrian emperors like he was alive then, and he loves them. </p>
<p>You can't really tell them that. </p>
<p>....what do you think of Anders Breivik?</p>
