<p>I saw you reblogged this</p>

<p>Might be totally unrelated but I don't want you to think I was pressuring you for a picture earlier for some sexual reason, I rather want to put a face on our conversation. That is enjoyment enough for me.</p>

<p>It is indeed sad that a girl might feel forced into sending a nude picture, I don't think feminists should have any monopoly on complaining about that. Fascists, as well as emphasizing gender roles, should differentiate themselves from the genuine misogynists who stand to gain the most from the loosening of morality.</p>
