			I used to hate gays but I have gay friends and family and just can't waste my time hating gays just because they fuck the same sex. As long as they're not radical and spreading it everywhere (no pun intended) why should I care. Also, I'm Hispanic on both sides and my father married a white woman. So I would have to disavow my family according to these people.

	Well those are your personal problems. My parents aren't fascists and aren't the most smart of people. That doesn't mean I can't have strong faith in fascist thought. I could give you a strong opinion on that messy situation but I would feel it would be rather invaluable to you. The question is though do you have any questions other questions concerning fascism?Â
