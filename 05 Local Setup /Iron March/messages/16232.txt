	I see, hadn't heard of that App before. (There is actually significant debate as to whether it is secure at all - see, for example, <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/49782/is-telegram-secure" rel="external nofollow">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/49782/is-telegram-secure</a>).

	Do you contact over Telegram, so as to have access to the phone numbers of individuals? If the group is pan-European and in its early stages of formation, why do you not communicate over the internet?

	Sorry to be cautious, but one must be wary of any underlying motives that may be behind approaches of this kind.
