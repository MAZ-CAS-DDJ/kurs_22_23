	That's true, there should be conscription for everybody, just like in the times of the Eastern Bloc. But you also have to see what is propaganda capable of: look at ourselves. The Jews killed more Whites with propaganda (Cultural Marxism, Liberalism, abortion, degeneracy etc.) than with weapons. Also, that's true that the internet is to big, but look at IronMarch: most of the information we need all in one place. I am sure that we could also start a topic on your plan to start a self-sustainable community.
