	A practiioner of Solipsism. <br />
	Basically rational skepticism applied to metaphysics<br />
	"How do I know if other entities other than me actually exist? I'm the only entity that I can verify that exists."<br />
	Don't think newbie is one, but his talk about "logic", "testing" and inability of "knowing" God reminded me of it.<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism</a>
