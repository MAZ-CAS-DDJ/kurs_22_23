	Hail,
</p>

<p>
	Visiting Scotland this weekend, can you recommend something worth seeing in either of the two cities? Ideally something related to Scottish culture and history that most tourists wouldn't discover.
</p>

<p>
	Also, it would be great to see some Scottish Dawn event, but I have no idea how often they do something (I don't have a Facebook account so if they still have that page, I wasn't able to find it), do you know if they're active in this way or if they're trying to fly under the radar?
