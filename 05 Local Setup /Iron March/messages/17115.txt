	Hey.
</p>

<p>
	Sorry bout not responding to the post re: the topic. I am currently overseas, so i havent had the time nor access to wifi in order to access Ironmarch. 
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, i have looked into it and have come to realize that you may be correct. Must have accidently been propagating residual spergfront autism.  I will look into it further when I get time later this month, but in the meantime i just thought to let you know that it seems you are right.

<p>
	I'll edit my last post sometime in the future and clarify my mistake.

<p>
	Thanks for the call out
