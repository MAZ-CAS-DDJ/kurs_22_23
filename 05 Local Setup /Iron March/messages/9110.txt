<p>Congrats on gaining modship. I was wondering how you were able to have yourself as a friend on the forum. </p>
<p>Come to think of it, it may have been the result of one of my errors when I was restoring your account from the forum database (I told Slavros what to do). It's a minor annoyance, but I do want to correct it if that's the case.</p>
