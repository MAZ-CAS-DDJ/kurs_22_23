<p>Thanks, I'd like to stick around here, but there is hardly any activity and it is kind of boring me. You motherfuckers are funny though, I enjoy the humor on here. But seriously, has this place always been so dead? Of course, fascists are hard to come by, but I want to actually post on an active forum, you know?</p>
