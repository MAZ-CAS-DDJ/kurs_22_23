<p>HA! wow! I'm south Asian (Indian from India). I have got to ask, what is your fascination with fascism? I'm surprised that a black person  would be interested in it. Don't get me wrong, I too think that right wing philosophy shouldn't just be reserved for the rich, stuck up, white kids (which seems this site is infested with), but I'm sure you have a very interesting story. No offense.</p>
