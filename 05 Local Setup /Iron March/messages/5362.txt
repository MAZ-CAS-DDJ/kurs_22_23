<p>You seem like a reasonable individual. I would not lie to you and say I am the biggest fan of Turks but Turks are smart enough to be civilized and have a functioning society, unlike blacks. I have more in common with you Greek and Armenian enemies then I do Turks but I feel you guys need to resolve your own border disputes. I focus on an Aryan empire in Southern Africa. I will not fight in a war with Turkey for Armenia and Greece. But anyway I am curious... What are your thoughts on the Armenian genocide?</p>
