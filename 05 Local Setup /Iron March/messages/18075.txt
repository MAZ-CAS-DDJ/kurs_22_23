	I talked with the one Asian kid in our school we had the same first name , but he kinda skittish soft spoken not like the Negroes I was used too. He tried to fit in with the black kids but he just couldn't make like me because I could get the humor and jokes and stuff he dressed pretty fly tho , got dem nikes.

	my Junior year there was this Chinese kid called Lam and he smoked cigarettes and wanted to be a redneck although he was like first generation American and had a thick Chinese accent, he was a year a head of me so in ROTC he was hilarious he never listened when the black kids gave him orders and he retorted with hilarious comebacks , he was also fat as shit, This black bitch was like where are you going , He was all like "to my car, What are you gonna do about it ?" lol our teacher / military guys had to break it up. He drove me home from school one day when my mom was at the hospital, he had me stop and get a rival Chinese restaurants menu for him since his parents owned a store.

	I thought I saw him at the bank with a Chinese wife a few months ago , he works on cars he went to tech school lol.

	Anyways those are my very limited experience with Asians aside from you of course, but Asia is full of pollution and I need my lungs to breathe , but yeah i honestly haven't met many Asians because Georgia isn't a place with alot of Asians.
