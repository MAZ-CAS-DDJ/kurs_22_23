	Ah, Bernie, I've heard of you, I think Kyle went up there to visit you guys a few months ago. Yeah I was beginning to get disappointed as well, lots of sitting around and talking but not a lot of activism, I'm also in the military and right around this time someone informed them that I was with BH, so they gave me the option to leave, I was already planning to so it was an easy decision. I was only involved for 2-3 years and a member for 1-1.5, I forget when exactly everything happened.
