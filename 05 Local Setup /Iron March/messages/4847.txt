<p>I'm a theist, I believe in a God which intelligently designed the world, that's all I know though. Every person I've ever met who was an opponent to intelligent design was somebody whom had no understanding of geography, climatology or any of those relevant fields or how the world works, they have no idea that these natural disasters have good outcomes and are necessary for the world to function and not just for "hurr natural selection, kill the dead weight off". I always give them the challenge of designing the world in a better way, or just something as complex as the human eye, they can never do it when all variables are considered. I think a belief in God is necessary and is a good motivating tool and it makes people feel like they're doing something for a good cause. Most people who ever did anything great believed in a God, everyone in Sumeria and the world before Christianity came believed in a God. It's Abrahamic religion which has made people rebel against God with all this Bakunin like atheistic rebellion because it's so fucking smug. Jesus just comes across as a condescending asshole in the bible, not even a tough love figure, just a jackass.</p>

<p>When you work in the scientific fields and get forced to work with evolutionary psychologists and arrogant evolutionists who listen to nothing else it's enough to turn most normal people bitter. Turning Christians into pagans or atleast pagan minded and spiritual people is easy, especially if you have brought up things like polygamy, killing opposition, race separation, premarital sex, drink and drugs (and I've even seen Mierce try to make an argument for prostitution) so long as they are controlled and channeled in the right way being endorsed by their own religion, then the switch to a reasonable, nationalist and pagan outlook, both materialistically and spiritual is pretty damn easy. I find Christians and other theists easier to work with than atheists; atheists are too wrapped up in scientific 'facts' which are easily moulded and made up, I can attest to and if you don't take my word for it even plagiarist Einstein said it.</p>

<p>There's a bit of historical truth to the bible (about 1/3 of it is of any use), and the definition of love which is timeless, the honouring father and loving mother and the race stuff but the rest of it is crap, stolen or made up. The Song of Solomon I have no doubt is plagiarized as are the Psalms.</p>

<p>Regarding Mein Kampf he made a good point right near the beginning which you touched on. That is the learning of 'facts and dates' in history, it's not really the true meaning to history; this can stretch out to other fields like the sciences, they're not concerned with a full picture only 'facts' and tidbits of information they can quickly repeat, without any finer working knowledge. It's amazing to have your true feelings on matters repeated back to you in such a clear and concise way. His experiences characterize a normal teenager as well, they certainly relate a lot to how I felt and interacted when I was a teen. I think they did with Rockwell as well when you read his autobiography. I agree completely on Das Kapital and all of the Marxist crap as well, I never got through all of it so I just have that nigger Thomas Sowell break it down for me since he was a former marxist. The point is brought up there as well, Marx and Lenin were notorious for fudging their numbers and facts and misquoting - the error of the strict materialist outlook.</p>
