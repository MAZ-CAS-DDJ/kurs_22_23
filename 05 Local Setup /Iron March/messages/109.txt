<p>Anything really, reviews on books, movies, music that has Fascist meanings or is Fascistic in style. Articles on current events, commentary on almost anything it just has to be political or cultural. Graphics are a must! But they must be in black and white. </p>
<p>I stress Americanism, that being said -I don't quite need an article on Englebert Dolfuss... But I may make an exception on foreign economic theories or practices. </p>
<p>Fiction works as well.</p>
<p>I am interested in some work on social credit, corporatism, distributism, think Ezra Pound and Father Charles Coughlin.</p>
<p>Let me know, if there is anything you have in mind we can certainly talk about it.</p>
