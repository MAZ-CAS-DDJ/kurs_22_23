	Greetings,
</p>

<p>
	years ago I have encountered <a href="http://golden-dawn-international-newsroom.blogspot.hu/2013/08/democratic-terrorism.html" rel="external nofollow">this article</a> and was wondering since then about what is the position of Golden Dawn on religion and spirituality, Hellenic Paganism and Orthodox Christianity and so on. I thought you are an inactive member so first I've asked another Greek but he couldn't tell me much. I presume you are a member of XA so I ask you: are some of your members into Mysticism and/or Cultic activities like pilgrimages to holy sites, rituals etc.? And if yes, are there any translated works around written by these philosophers or mystics? I am thinking of people similar to Mircea Eliade or Emil Cioran who were involved in such things around the times of the Iron Guard.
