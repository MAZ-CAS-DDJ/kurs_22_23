<p>Yeah, combustion is bad news. Though your mercury is only combust by "orb" (it's not right into the sun, but a long ways off). This affects negatively the "accidental dignity" of the planet, meaning the quality of circumstances. This sucks given that mercury rules over a lot of stuff in your chart (houses 2,3,4 and 7), and also that mercury is peregrine (it has no essential dignity - or inherent strength). So, shitty circumstances and shitty basic quality. In the case of money (2nd house), it would indicate you weren't born into a wealthy familly, you don't have much talent for accumulating wealth, and you're in a situation which isn't favorable for making money either (your job, career, or just the fact that you're a nazi living in sweden...).</p>

<p>On the other hand, your jupiter has very strong essential dignity, and rules over 4 houses too, so it makes it a somewhat extreme chart where some things are very strong and others very weak.</p>

<p>As for being barely in the combustion limit, there are two very different cases possible. Is the planet barely combust because it's <em>separating</em> from the sun, or is it barely combustin because it's <em>just about to</em> come into contact with the sun? If it's separating, then it's really not a big deal, since it'll all be over soon. But if it's applying instead, then things go from bad to worse.</p>
