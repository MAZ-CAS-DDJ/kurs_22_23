<p>I may have said I was an honorary Bulgarian, but that's all. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>You're obviously not a real nazi if you can't tell my exact racial makeup from my facial structure.</p>
<p>Aussie, Welsh, Anglo, slightly French. I've never taken a genetic test but we know our family history to about 300 years. My family was part of the convicts who settled Australia so I guess I'm a base-bred peasant. But, at least I'm a white peasant. If you're into racialist sperging I'm at least to SS racial standards.</p>

<p>So, yeah, the answer was "Australian".</p>

<p>Well, I was moving in the first place because of a girl. I ended up not moving because of girl trouble. Did you know you're all hysterical and evil creatures?</p>
