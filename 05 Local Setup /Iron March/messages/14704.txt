	Haha thats fine. Nice to meet you too. There are only like 4-5 other Polish people on this website. Like actually from Poland, members of Falanga. They're just here to promote the group. I'm also diaspora. But I have my own group that I'm starting to put together with some friends of mine in Poland, UK, and USA. The goal is to eventually create a Paramilitary. If you're interested I have a group chat on Gadu-Gadu. Its all Polish Fascists and NS.
