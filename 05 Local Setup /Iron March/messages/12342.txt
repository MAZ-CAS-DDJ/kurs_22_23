<p>Thanks. I have actually read some of Mein Kampf before, and to be honest at the time I subscribed to a Marxist worldview so I remember being unimpressed. I'll read it again and see what I think.</p>

<p>On a side note, seeing as you liked my post renouncing homosexuality, would you.. "vouch" for me in that thread, so I don't get gassed? Don't know how much sway you'd have but I don't feel like getting banned when I'm still interested in learning.</p>
