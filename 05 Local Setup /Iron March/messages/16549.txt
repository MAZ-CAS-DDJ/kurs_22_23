	Honestly I got one the other day. I still haven't worn it. I reserve my larping for when I go hiking innawoods. Made of cotton rather than wool, but it's the exact same design. Made by Mil-Tec. Wool is always nicer. Best material. Bit larpy to wear it regardless though especially when out and about casually. I don't normally wear hats anyway however.
