<p>Alright thanks. I guess in retrospect that kind of submissive attitude might explain my low self esteem. As for my upbringing I was born into a Protestant (Methodist) family. Although in recent years I have stopped going to church and Nietzsche has had a big influence on me, if that tells you something. Though, I admit that I enjoy the tales of the old gods a lot in fact. Just with my background however, my family is even intolerant of atheism. Which, I really don't see atheism as a big deal as long as you devote your life to something like serving the state or some cause, not this new atheism sperg shit, that I do have a problem with.
