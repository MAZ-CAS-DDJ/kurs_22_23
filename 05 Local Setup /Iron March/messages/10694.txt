<p>Not quite worthy of a proper post, but I noticed there are spelling mistakes on one of the banner quotes. </p>
<p>The quote reads: "All that is wonderful is hard"- said the greeks. "All that is wonderful on earth demands expiation" - said Christianity through Calvary. All that is wonderful is acheived through destruction, suffering, blood.</p>
<p>I don't know by whom it is, but 'greeks' should be 'Greeks' and 'acheived' should be 'achieved'.</p>
<p>As a sidenote, is there a complete list of all quotes and their authors compiled somewhere?</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
