	Yeah I think Internet groups need a physical presence, but mainly a support group, to build bonds and support each other, as we follow the most ostracised ideology in history, and not everyone of us has a perfect set of skills, so possibly lodging, advice, hopefully helping people get jobs, as well as serving as an educational platform, not only to educate others but also ourselves with a pseudo book club approach, the group would hopefully teach as it learns.Â
