	No worries heval, of course we're going to be logging in and out throughout the days and weeks, considering our different time zones.

	I see. Could you elaborate on your problem with group projects? Because one thing we're gonna have to do is being socially active, and as we know groups and bands of people (basically uniting the fasces together into one bundle) is what fascism is all about. Now, of course different people are going to have different types of tasks, but I'm wondering what aspects of group work you found problematic, so that your abilities would be maximized most naturally. Also, could you share what other problems you're struggling with? For example, for me: I bite my finger nails, I used to be slightly overweight (though I'm much better now), and I used to drink alcohol (though I've stopped). Basically any problems or obstacles you're facing in general. If we compare and contrast this list with your skills/aspirations, then we can see where you fit best in the Kurdish struggle.

	That Kurmanji course will be perfect then. Because again, this is one huge obstacle stopping you from fully connecting with your homeland and people again. But if you learn Kurdish, then you could really contribute to the cause. Again, your exceptional knowledge really can't go waste. If you just go that extra mile in the struggle (which as you know is your duty as an awakened fascist), you will undoubtedly achieve great results. (It feels so amazing to talk to a fellow Kurdish fascist, by the way, since for normal Kurds I'd have to explain these basic facts a thousand times, but I'm sure you already know everything about Struggle and Truth and all that.)

	Ah, I know about Europe's Kurdish community being mostly made up of people from Bakur who support the PKK. But you know, most of these people are actually just idiots. I like to call them "Kurdish larpers" or "Kurdish cosplayers." Because if you look at them, you'll see how the only thing Kurdish about them is that they might go to Newroz in Kurdish clothes once a year, or they might wave some dumb flags, or they might shout some meaningless slogans, but then at the end they all go back to their normal degenerate lives without any of this having any sort of impact on them. They're really just the Kurdish version of larpers and cosplayers. A single Kurdish fascist, who lives by his faith and creed during every moment of his everyday life, is more powerful than 10000 of these larpers combined.

	Regarding our vision for Kurdistan, I guess we can start with the most obvious: what will <em>not</em> be in that vision. Certainly, I'd say: there will be no parliament, no democracy, no voting, no parties of any kind, no politics at all in the modern sense, no capitalism, no communism, no feminism, no tribalism, no atheism, no Islam, no Abrahamic religions, no Jews or niggers or faggots, no humanism, no globalism, and no trade with the outside world. I believe we are so far in complete agreement, right?

	And yeah, Evola is great. He isn't as spiritual as the likes of Guenon or Savitri Devi (who, for instance, are just out-and-out esoteric mysticists). But Evola's spirituality is more grounded in reality, which is why I like his writings more when it comes to the general fascist worldview. Oh, and have you read Mein Kampf yet?

<p>
	You take care too, man. Glad to be talking to you again.
