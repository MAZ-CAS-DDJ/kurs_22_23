<p>Sadly no, but I'm planing to contact them in near future, probably their next tribina (meeting) and becoming one. They are worth my support and I would like to contribute to their effort, even the smallest one like sticker distribution and such.</p>
<p>If you're interested in their work, ideas and action I would gladly share with you whatever is public.Â </p>
<p>Why this is such a big deal is because there's a witch hunt on real nationalists here, so one must be careful what he says and does in public, regardless if it respects the laws.</p>
