<p>Hey Xav,</p>
<p>This is Blackshirt 13 here. I was just wondering how much you knew about Mithras, since you seem to know about paganism. Was just wondering if there were any good stories/books or information on him? All I know is that he was popular among the Roman Legionaries. Also, you think that it is weird that I like the Roman Legion so much even though I'm a Celt? Anyways, sorry to bother you. Please let me know if you get this message.</p>
<p>Hail, </p>
