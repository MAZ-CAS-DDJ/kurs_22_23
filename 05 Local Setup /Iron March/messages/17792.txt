	When you say Italy and Germany where Socialist, perhaps ethically but not economically. They where corporatist, the right-wing version of putting socialist ethics into economics. I have a couple questions. There is a common misunderstanding to what prevents monopolies from forming, people have wrongly been misled to believe that it’s government regulations that prevent the monopolies when in real fact it’s the government regulations that create them, so why? Two vitally important concepts at work that prevent monopolies from forming:
</p>

<p>
	1. Consumer Choice<br />
	2. Competition
</p>

<p>
	The free market economy is fiercely competitive with strong consumer choice. I know they remove private trade unions and make it a publicly negotiated thing (class cooperation) but what exactly stops monopolies, lobbying, over regulation &amp; corruption from forming under corporatism ie the negation of the above two? Also how are fair wages decided? I don't know if there is a perfect system but its we can atleast come up with the most pragmatic.
