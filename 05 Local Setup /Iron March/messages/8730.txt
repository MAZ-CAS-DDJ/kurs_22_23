<p>Oh cool, so we have something in common. Mine's an ex fiance too. No that's a pretty shit thing to have in common actually, forget that. I still have the feels because I'm a romantic FAGGOT.</p>

<p>Moving to east Europe is pretty cool too, makes me feel like less of a retard for wanting to do the same. Was there anywhere in particular you had your eye on? I know you're part Croat.</p>

<p>Also why?</p>
