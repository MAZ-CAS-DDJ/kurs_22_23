<p>Welcome to the forum if I have not said that to you already.</p>
<p>A few have joined but they haven't really stayed.</p>
<p>There used to be another who used to be active but he seems to have disappeared unfortunately.</p>
<p>It would be nice for the Ã‰ire sub-forum to become active but it would be quite difficult with just two people but if you ever feel like posting something in relation to Ireland then you know where to post it, don't you?</p>
