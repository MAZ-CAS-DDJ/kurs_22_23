<p>If by movement you mean a party or a group, that form has a limited shelf-life. People move in, outgrow fascism or become bored and then move on to the next thing. In studying fascist/National Socialist/nationalist movements and talking to experienced, older fascists, this is the pattern that is repeated time and again. Fascism is a revolution of the spirit and needs to be nurtured, not just exercised.</p>
<p>I would suggest you try to start a fascist community. How you organize it is up to you. It can be a group of people affiliated through their ideas that gather for a variety of purposes, or it can be an actual commune, wherein you all live together. The point is to draw together like-minded people into a community of mutual support. That way you can solidify your ideas and enlarge them, re-enforce them and, gradually, with care, add others to the community, enlarging it. This creates a counterculture that forms the seeds of a genuine movement.</p>
