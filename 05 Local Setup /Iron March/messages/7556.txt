<p>Good stuff. Day of the sword is still my fave RAC band; the main man was one of the last of a dying breed from the good old ruthless nationalist days. The concept of groups like The Order, Aryan Republican Army and their actual actions gained more respect for the cause from people who matter and can make a difference than any modern group has. Gone are the days where good old humble American pie and being squeaky clean are the mark of someone respectable, they've been turned on their head against us to stifle us while the enemy plays with the gloves off. The only thing most people understand and come to respect these days is RAW POWER. In pop culture the heroes are Walter White, not John Wayne anymore. Someone with principles but someone who is a rogue. Leftists are THE establishment, nationalists are not, they genuinely hate the current order and want to shake it up; we don't give a fuck about progressing the current system. We have our anger directed in the right places at the right time, we don't have chips on our shoulders and bitch for the sake of it.</p>
