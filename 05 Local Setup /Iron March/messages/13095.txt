	Great perspective you have on UPF, seems we both feel similar on a lot of things. You seem like a pretty reasonable man. I never noticed they do a communist hand gesture before. I find that facinating. I don't watch the videos either, but have watched a handful of Blairs videos. I follow his personal page though.

	My children are two and five, a boy and girl. My girl maybe five but she knows about racial segregation and the importance of it. She also told me she is going to marry a blonde man one day. Both my children are big, strong, and not pacifists.

	My daughter does not know about Jews, or more complicated history. Only the "kind after like kind/ birds of a feather" philosophy, which I push strictly.

	Both my babies from 4 months old could distinguish race and both would only smile at whites. So even babies know their own tribe from a foriegn one.
