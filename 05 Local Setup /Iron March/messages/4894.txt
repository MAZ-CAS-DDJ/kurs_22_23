<p>Intredasting - when talking of whether europeans originated from the Middle East, do you have some sources which I could take a gander at? It's becoming a real pain whenever in a discussion to hear some prick raise the claim we're from Africa and expect that to end the argument on WE ALL BLEED RED grounds. And Pashto too? You really went to town on dissing Anglos, lol - was good entertainment; I was half expecting some forum christian to take up issue and start a big religious slug-out, shame they didn't. From what I've observed not that many forum christians seem to be as aggressive in their knowledge as Mierce and your facade - Talley's given up on the quoting matches, and I think the most recent christianity debate has been in the Himmler thread with Vlad and Ben debating whether christianity is a homosexual women-hating faith. Have none of them disagreed and recognised the distorting of christianity you've been doing? They, after all being actual christians, should know when someone is leading them astray to pagan heathen beliefs (lel).</p>
