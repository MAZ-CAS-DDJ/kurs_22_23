<p>I think Breivik was a pathological idiot to be honest, who targeted the product and not the producer. The Hapsburg Empire was Evola's ideal because it was created by a spiritual race that transcended cultural, religious and racial boundaries. Evola wrote that the jew may have the soul of an aryan and an aryan the soul of a jew. My own racism, if you will, is similar to Evola's.</p>
