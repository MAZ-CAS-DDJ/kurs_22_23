	Yes, but a word of warning: from now on I think wearing masks for activism should be a must. Also, be careful where you post/brag/whatever. The Boston police apparently don't like to fuck around. They were threatening 5 years in prison if they found who did BU. And they got security footage of the other fellow. We didn't wear masks, but from now on being more careful would probably be for the best.Â
