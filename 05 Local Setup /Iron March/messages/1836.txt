<p>AB.</p>
<p>I'm honoured by your wish to collaborate with me. I could definately use some constructive critcism.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, I've no previous manifesto writing experience, in fact, I haven't read many either.</p>
<p>Now that I mention it, I'll try an make time during my studies to read up on some.</p>
<p>Basicly I've been sitting on a number of ideas and musings for a long time, constantly evovlving, and I've never been quite able to get them coherently and convincingly onto papaer before despite my attempts. However, upon listening to Ben's audio manifesto for his party I felt a wave of inspiration, my thoughts becames clearer and more convicted. I think his words help spell out in clarity much of what I had been trying to work out for myself, and now that I've got the ball rolling I've got to keep it rolling.</p>
<p>The work I've done so far is I've written up about 70% of my opening propaganda narrative to win the hearts (along the lines of Ben's manifesto), I have a constitution drafted (along the lines of the US constitution e.g Congress shall pass no law that etc etc.) and I've even created a flag for the party and country.</p>
<p>In wiriting the narrative, I have found that it is best to keep a shart wit and a very brisk pace, constantly linking back to real-world examples that people recognise instantly without the need to elaborate or much explanation. At this point, persuasion is paramount over reasoning.</p>
<p>I'll finish the narrative by the end of the week and I'll let you read over it for me.</p>
<p>In the mean time though, here's the link to my flag design: <a href="http://themchap123.deviantart.com/#/d5905ld" rel="external nofollow">http://themchap123.deviantart.com/#/d5905ld</a></p>
<p>Tell me what you think of it.</p>
