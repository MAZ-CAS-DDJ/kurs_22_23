<p>I have a question about your Fascist Cash method when actually using the printer. When 'printing' on the dollar bills, are you really just scanning them? Also, what type and strength of tape are you using to hold the money in place? Final question; have you tried feeding them in any sort of machine, such as vending machine yet, with success?</p>
