<p>Thank you very much, sir.</p>
<p>I'm surprised this community tolerates the Jewish influence. The Jew should have been warned for posting outright lies and for degenerating a thread.</p>
<p>I also hate how the Jew in <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/1221-the-holy-land-arab-jewish-or-christian/page__view__findpost__p__33766" rel="">The Holy Land: Arab, Jewish or Christian?</a> He is basically using the tactic, divide and conquer. He thinks that Muslims own certain lands just for living there. That's bullshit.</p>
<p>But, thanks for the warning regarding crypto-Jews. I will keep my eyes out.</p>
