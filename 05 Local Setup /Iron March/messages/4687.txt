I don't know where you got the idea that Russians hate Catholics but it isn't real. I would argue the Protestant church is considerably more universalism and liberal in the respect to its power and the scope of personal discretion upon spiritual matters. Protestantism in itself is a revolution against hierarchy, hence the charges of its corruption, when Protestantism establishes its own hierarchy and places the same power in different hands- literally millions of hands, as opposed to one unified church. Islam? Islam is foreign and adversarial, though I imagine Russians when they do give a fuck have more respect for spiritually serious Eastern religion than Western religious flirtations and promiscuity, which is exponentially pervasive in the Protestant world.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>I read Alexander Mongolros revision of Russian history on Iron March Forums. He repeatedly mentioned that Russians are Anti-Catholic, Anti-European, and Semi-Mongoloid. What the hell is his mixed heritage?</p>
<p>I was baptised an Episcopalian but I left the the Church because their social liberalism is disgustingly heretical. I remained a Protestant out of respect for my Northern European heritage. Honestly, my faith in Christianity is shaky.</p>
