<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I already had thought of just rolling with it all.</p>
<p>I think the worst part of it all is actually my fathers side handling this. they're jews. </p>
<p>I'm probably already on the track to being disowned by them so its probably best to keep my mouth shut for now</p>
<p>So far I don't think they know my name for ironmarch but my skype, steam, and other stuff got searched so I'm unsure.</p>
<p>I dislike the fact that simply mentioning a piece of our beliefs will get us destroyed, left, disowned, etc.</p>
<p>I would like to see that change one day.</p>
<p>Blut und Ehre.</p>
