			Yeah I do (I live in south eastern michigan), if you're planning on doing some activism I can't I'm too young at the moment but thanks for the message. <img alt=":handy:" data-emoticon="" src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/handy.png" title=":handy:" /></p>

	Ah, that's understandable. No activism though, at least not this time around, just visiting some friends/a comrade like I said.

	You might want to consider some lone wolf activism, I started when I was ~16. Spraying flyers up quick with water bottles, custom stickers, that type of stuff. Well, depends on your area. Might not be wise around Detroit. Still check out Max on fb if you have time.
