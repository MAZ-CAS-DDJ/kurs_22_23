	Hi, I made the recent propaganda pieces for the SRN, that being the 'Symbol of our struggle' and 'Degeneracy has no place in Britain'. As you can see I have still a bit of learning to do as they seem quite plain so I'd very much appreciate it if you gave me a few tips if you're familiar with propaganda design and if not could you point me in the direction of someone that could help. (I'm in the IM Discord if you'd rather talk to me there.)Â
