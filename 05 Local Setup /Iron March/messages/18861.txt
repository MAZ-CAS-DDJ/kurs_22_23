	Well, we don't own guns, but I hope that in a couple of years we reach their level. We have branches in Masovian, Pomeranian, Kuyavian-Pomeranian, Lesser Poland Voivodeships and recently we saw a reactivation of Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. Have you done some activism with your Polish Diaspora comrades or are you working with other nationalist groups?
