<p>And you too!  Integralism is a diverse ideology and is highly dependant on the country in which it bases itself.  It is especially popular in Brazil and in Catholicism both historically and currently and is generally non-racial in nature.  I am still not 100% in one way or another on what my beliefs are at present but the Integralism as proposed from Britain is what am I currently leaning to and adapting to an Irish context.</p>
<p>Ironmarch's own Benjamin Noyle's site is where I first learned of the idea of Integralism and I continue to develop my own ideas on top of his base of ideology.</p>
