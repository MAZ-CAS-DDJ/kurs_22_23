	Well, like I said in my post in trivial happenings I had to change my minor to history since if I stick with the German minor I won't graduate before the Pell grant money stops. So, unfortunately I'll just have to table learning a foreign language for now. I might get more time to learn a language after I graduate which at my current rate may be late 2017 or early to mid 2018. I figure then I could just focus on learning a foreign language in the evenings after work since I won't have homework in the evenings anymore. Right now I am just going to focus on passing my German class and all the other work I will have to do in prep for graduation which is still a-ways off. But at least when I do pick up trying to teach my self German and Italian again (probably German first) I can go at my own pace and not have to worry about grades. So, as far as my learning a foreign language that is officially tabled for at least a couple years. I'll probably use my free time during Uni breaks to just read books I want to read for fun like I always have during Uni breaks and just re-start learning a foreign language after I graduate.
