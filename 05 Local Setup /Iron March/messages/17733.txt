	Oh, sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, I actually only have replacement means for breakfast only. And even then not everyday, just most days. As for the snacks during the day that is just to ensure that I am not too hungry when lunch or supper time comes around. Thus ensuring that I can get away with eating smaller portions. And this may actually be a coincidence but last time I was at the gym I weighed myself and I've lost 3lbs. I've been doing this "new diet" for a weeks now maybe even a month or maybe even a bit longer than that even idk I'm so busy that it's hard to keep track. Also, been considering picking up some protein bars and shakes from the local grocery store too.
