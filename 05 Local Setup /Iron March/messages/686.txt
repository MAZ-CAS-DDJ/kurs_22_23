<p>My feelings on Scandinavian/Nordic cooperation is that it would be more reasonable than the EU. Because of the more similar cultures of the Scandinavian countries and languages it would be a more stable faction. With the EU there alot of different Cultures like French, German Russian English etc. and that specific culture has their own specific languages and traditions. But with the Scandinavian countries, perhaps with the exception of Finland, their languages and traditions pretty much is alike. Though i wouldn't say that the German culture is all that different, The language itself it pretty much the key stone for the scandinavian language, with the exception for Finland ofc. And with the strong Economic stability of the Scandinavian nations + Germany and Finland it would be a real profitable union of the countries. And when i mean Union i do not mean Like the EU where they would like to assimilate every country into a greater EU. No when i mean a union i mean a cooperation of countries of economic scientific technological political and cultural unity. </p>
<p>Lol this was a long rant i do apologise. But i hope this answers your question if not then do tell.</p>
