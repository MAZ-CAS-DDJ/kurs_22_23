<p>Hello TotalitarianSocialist,</p>
<p>I was wondering if i could borrow a few moments of your time so you could help me to better understand the benefits of agrarianism and how you would have it set up? I have recently taken an interest in the topic but most of the sources i find on it are some sort of egalitarian doctrine, or a libertarian/communal doctrine. I was wondering how it would work in a totalitarian state, and why you personally feel it is a good philosophy? </p>
<p>thank you for your time. </p>
