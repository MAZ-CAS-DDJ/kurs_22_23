	No worries, friend. It's all good. Thanks for the books and the link recommendations. I remember reading a bit about Coomaraswamy somewhere, but this is the first time I've gotten one of his works. I'll have a good look into all of these. The blog especially looks very interesting, and it's already raising some metaphysical questions in my mind.
