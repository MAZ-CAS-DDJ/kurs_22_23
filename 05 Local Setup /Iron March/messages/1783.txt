<p>William, you are a lot more intelligent than them. And such 'Fascists' they are, Mussolini found the notion of race absurd in the first place. Their beliefs are not born out of Fascism, but out of chauvinism and racism.</p>
<p>Mine are born out of the desire for progress, not some uneducated beliefs based on sentimentality instead of rationality. When genetic engineering will reach its peak, I will never have any problems with concepts such as race. The wider the gene pool, the better. As long as I can maintain a homogenous people(both in beliefs and in looks,) I have no problem with racial mixing, especially taking into consideration that it actually a positive thing from a biological perspective.</p>
<p>Those "proles" are simply idiotic. They are no elite.</p>
<p>My desire is the world and my goal is the stars. You could easily make the invaded countries believe that they are the same people as you after generations of indoctrination and genetic engineering.</p>
