I ask this because I knew a West Point cadet that dropped out after 9/11 because he wouldn't wait to serve his nation, and he said that WP cadets spend so much time and energy on life at WP that they have some trouble connecting with the common solider.</div></blockquote>
<p>But all of the officers would've had to go through the five years of soldiering to get their vote and the right to be an officer in the first place.</p>

<p>It would be made impossibly difficult and also illegal to hold responsibilities across the three critical fields, which are the corporate sector, its upper echelons (government) and the military. If your in the position where you hold a high rank of office, that position will include tireless work in that field on threat of being demoted if quality labor is not received. A position can be held for a lifetime since it should only be possible to replace someone if they are less qualified than another pretender to that position, or have made a severe failing. It's intended that only the best hold honorable positions, and fight extremely hard to continue holding them, because such positions will indeed require a great deal of expertise or specialized knowledge, experience, intelligence and integrity. If they are not up to the task they are replaced. But by no means would it be possible or conceivable for them to work dual jobs, since the leadership positions don't entail, as they do now, sitting on a chair somewhere and discussing bullshit matters. The leadership I envision should active in the daily task of the worker and the improvement of all conditions. Once again, if they are not up to this, they are to be replaced.</p>

<p>That's not how classes work. No matter to whom you are born you do not receive your citizenship and your rights for free. You have to pay for them off the sweat of your brow. Therefore everyone is allowed entry into the class if they are capable. No 'class' is being promoted because a new class is being created, and re-birthed with each new generation. You misunderstand this transcendental meritocratic class system for a traditional hierarchical one. Effectively it rejects all considerations of 'class' conflict and therefore even class collaboration. All of the economic Marxist garbage is tossed out the window because you have a governing class that is literally the state, and a nation that is fully integrated into it. The state exists on every level, it isn't separated from the populace because it <span style="text-decoration:underline;">is</span> the populace, therefore no one can exploit or abuse anyone, they'll be tossed out immediately because every position, every gear has another one that checks and corrects it, by democratic means or otherwise.</p>

I would say that what he does is policy criticism. He doesn't really mock the nation like a Bill Maher or some other comedians.</div></blockquote>
<p>Quite simply then: Chomsky allowed, Maher banned.</p>

<p>Critique of some policy or some politician is allowed. Critique of the state as an entity, it's mantle as the supreme head of the nation, and its fundamental organization of national syndicalist can not be put under question. Reform and such can be discussed on the upper echelons of the state syndicates, but these are directly elected by those most devoted and committed, those that have sacrificed most for their country, therefore the 'people's' voice is heard anyway.</p>
