<p>Several actually, none of which I'd put my faith into. There are three main claims to the throne, the Legitimists who support the elder line of the Bourbon branch through the King of Spain, and want the Prince of Asturias, "Louis XX" to be the king, Orleanists who support the junior Bourbon-Orleans family and want the "Count of Paris," "Henry VII".</p>
<p>Then the Bonapartists which are my own sympathy, who want to restore the last remnant of the Bonaparte dynasty, Jean-Christophe, who would be Napoleon IV, V, or VII depending on how you're counting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Orleanists are definitely the most vocal and probably the most realistic monarchists, but they want a liberal parliamentary monarchy in the English mold, so fuck that. The Legitimists are fighting for a lost cause and are heavily tied into the far-right because of the associations with Catholicism and nationalism, but they would have a very hard time selling the idea unless there was significant build up. However they essentially hate everything since 1789 so I can't abide by that. The Bonapartists have no actual political manifestation of monarchism since the Bonapartist cause has become political but a lot of right wing politicians have a pretty religious attachment to Napoleon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for myself I am monarchist by conviction but republican by pragmatism.</p>
