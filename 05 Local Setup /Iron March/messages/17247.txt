	Hooo boy lol. Well I'd try my damn damnedest to get 03 and yes, getting an 03 contract is more often than not a long process. Since we aren't pushing anywhere in the foreseeable future (though they just sent 500 guys back to the Stan) it's gonna be harder to get, especially since, Marine=Infantry to eveyone. Good luck when you get there. Don't cuck and don't show weakness. They'll eat that shit up so fast.
