	Hello there and I was told by Rise_against that four people including himself are looking to join the Silver Legion. I live in Central PA if you didn't know so we're fairly close. I would say don't get too intimidating with the officials and city, if anything, when we gain more power and influence among the people I say we have one or more of the legionaries run for public office and change things from the inside.  But if you could spread the message that would be great! Try to get more amount of media coverage than the atomwaffen stickering so the atomwaffen name is in the back of their minds and the Silver Legion name is in the front of their minds. They take some down, put x2 the number up.
