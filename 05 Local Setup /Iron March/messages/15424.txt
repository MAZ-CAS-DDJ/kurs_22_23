	No I played primarily as a sith warrior, and then imperial agent second. Plenty of people here understand the camaraderie but they are pretty abrasive too. I can be as well but moreso towards my enemies or those I'm unsure about. If you're gonna be busy with Uni all year you'd better study hard and get good grades. Doesn't hurt to take quick breaks and read non-uni related material though, gotta stay sane after all. Unless you love uni.
