	Hey I just figured its best to ask you this in private if you don't mind answering.  Im sure you are aware of the IM anti Alt right policy.  Since you are working for DS which is pretty pro alt right  I was wondering what your view of what we as IM should be doing in America.  Do you think we should join AW or a DS book club or both?  What do you see as the plan for America in specific terms of organizations, and where do you think would be the best area to apply our efforts?
