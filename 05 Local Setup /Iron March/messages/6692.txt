<p>I know exactly how you feel. I used to smoke for probably about a year, then chewed tobacco about just as long after having quit smoking. Now iv'e kicked everything, drinking included. Been total straight edge probably since around the start of the year, maybe a bit before.</p>

<p>Glad to hear you're kicking it though, it's not a good habit to have.</p>
