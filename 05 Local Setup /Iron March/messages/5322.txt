<p>In the book<strong> "The birth of Fascist ideology" by Zeev Sternhell</strong> (also available in English) there are several chapters that are dedicated to national-syndicalism, which go very detailed into the subject. Certainly an very interesting work for those who want to dive into the orgins of fascism. Its expensive, but certainly worth its price.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The link between Anarchism and Fascism is twofold.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At one hand the ideogical program of fascism owes a lot from pre-Marxist utopian socialism and anarchism. The works of<strong> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</strong> provide a good insight into early organic anarchism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the other hand fascism developed from the revolutionary syndicalist movement. This movement was especially inspired by "the father of the conservative revolution" <strong>George Eugene Sorel</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most literature I have about these thinkers is in Dutch, but probably a lot of sources in English can also be found. I prefer to read reference works about these thinkers, because their own works are quite heavy reading material.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Its difficult these days to get revolutionary-syndicalist works from this tendency, especially considering most is in French. But a good source I have is <strong>"The theory of Syndicalism" by Clara Wichman (1920)</strong>, although I'm not sure if its available in English.</p>
