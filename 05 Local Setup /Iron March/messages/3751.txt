<p>Yes, unfortunately I reside in the veritable mixing bowl of destitution known as southeastern Wisconsin. I have for 15 years now. I keep telling myself that I am going to depart, perhaps move to northern Wisconsin, or out of state. Never happens, however. Too much tying me here I suppose. And you? I take you are a Wisconsinite as well?</p>
