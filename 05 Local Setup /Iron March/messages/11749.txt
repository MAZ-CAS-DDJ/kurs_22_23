<p>I just listened to "The Serbian Podcast" and really fucking enjoyed it. That was gold.</p>
<p>Was that yourself, Ben and Torren speaking? Forgive me if I'm wrong - I was pretty fucked up dealing with the gravitas of our situation when I first arrived here and was wary of interacting with 'foreign' fascists in particular due to a lack of let's say, 'humanising' impressions. So I didn't attempt to cosy up to you guys at all. I'm still a bit vague on who's who.</p>
<p>Anyway, was hilarious to hear you guys take Torren to task. He's so American, haha. Interesting. Ben's a switched on guy. Pretty mature perspective. I honestly didn't expect that (that probably reflects more on my habits than your work here).</p>
<p>Anyway, I've got family to see. Perhaps we could conference sometime? </p>
