<p>We do agree on lot of thing but i had a question for you.</p>
<p>Do you support big chain Company (Microsoft , Coca Cola , Wall mart) or Small business like i do ?</p>
<p>Just trying to figure out your view more.</p>
<p>I'm more into small Business because it what keep my Region aflow.</p>
<p>I'm from the Region of Saguenay in Northern Quebec, its mostly Rural but we do have a small Urban center.</p>
<p>Some big company did give us good jobs (Aluminum Factory, Paper Factory and Lumber business) but recently most of them closed down leaving many unemployed so we have to focus on small business to survive.</p>
<p>Most of my friend work at my buddy Family bakery. I did work there but i now work at a local restaurant.</p>
<p>I heard you owned a small business, care to tell me what it is?</p>
