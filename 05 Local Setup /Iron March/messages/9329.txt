<p>Sending you my writings has been nothing short of cathartic, Ida. I haven't shared them with anyone else, there is nobody who would understand them, and sometimes the pressure of keeping them under wraps becomes unbearable. This conversation has been the best release valve I could have hoped for.</p>

<p>In almost all of my poems I am indeed writing of a homeland or a lover, if it is not exactly clear it is not really meant to be. When the feeling strikes me, they can be one and the same.</p>

<p>Dichotomy is everything, I think. I embraced the darker existence to understand life. Embracing hate and the aesthetics of death, violence, and murder led me to appreciate life and love and hold sentiment without weakness. I used to hate myself, wonder why I was made this way, percieve myself as damaged for not conforming to modern society. But I came to understand that we're in an upside down world. Like Alex said, would you fault a falling cat for righting itself?</p>
<p>Naturally I'm preaching to the choir here, you're no stranger to more morbid fascinations.</p>

<p>I am strangely happy to say that I have no woman, only girls. I have dated three different girls so far this year, but no relationship resulted, much less a real connection! The first one was the best, which isn't saying much, if only because I had some expectation of romance. After the third date we stopped texting. This is typical for me it seems. I always charm girls initially, but my interest in them is limited if they are greatly lacking in awareness of themselves and the world, and I think they can sense it. Bottom line, I will never enter a relationship where I cannot express my fascism purely and unadulterated by their sensibilities. Acting otherwise is the start of a long road to treason and dishonor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In contrast, you are special beyond measure, and I can percieve this merely through the window of a few messages. In person, oh my, it is my greatest desire we meet one day.</p>

<p>The poet speaks truth in every word! I am going to steal the metaphor of sadness carving a cup for joy for myself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is the traditional view to percieve these apparent opposites as complementary. The physical and the mental spheres should not be separated, just as sadness and joy.</p>

<p>I realized I haven't told you my name, btw. I'm Emilio.</p>
