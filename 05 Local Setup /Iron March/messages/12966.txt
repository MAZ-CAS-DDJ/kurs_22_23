	Typically you would have a shrine to represent that god. Not a statue like that one generally if you're Germanic, as their idols were more abstract. Romans had statues of their gods that were shaped as men. There are many rituals to worship, such as blots where you sacrifice an animal over the idol or altar and then eat the animal in a feast. You can also just give offerings to the gods, such as food left at the altar or in some cases just say a prayer. Better to offer something alongside the prayer however.
