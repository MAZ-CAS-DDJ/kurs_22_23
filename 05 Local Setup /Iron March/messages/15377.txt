	Yes Capitalism and Communism are 2 sides of the same Jewish coin. Both destroy anything sacred to a man and his land for the international interest. Same thing happening in Poland to a degree. International Finance is a cancer. The country sides are still pretty folkish and traditional though. That pretty much goes for most of Eastern Europe. In my introduction on this forum I talked about Permaculture and Fascist Autarky. People like Hitler and Mussolini recognized the extreme importance of farmers and their land and were very generous to them. Sons were expected to inherit their father's land and to pass it down from generation to generation [Blood &amp; Soil]. Farming is the foundation of any society - and I think Fascism has been the best for the farmers. However, many farmers are swayed from the truth and latch onto the corrupt ideas of false Environmentalism and Eco-Capitalism. Capitalism robs small farmers and destroys local communities. Communism abolishes any land ownership and has starved millions. It really is a shame that Rich Jews have put their filthy hands into our fertile and rich Eastern European soil. One day those Christ-hating kikes will face nothing but agony and torture.

	Also: What is the whole ordeal between Romanians and Hungarians? As a Pole I love my Hungarian brothers, but I don't really understand the discord and hatred between you two. Polish people don't really take sides with things like this. We respect both.
