	That's a good question, but as you could see in my intro, I don't know much about Bulgaria. I was working with some Bulgarians and they told me that the Bulgarian identity is Slavic, so I was surprised when you told me that's not the case. When I started my research on Hungary and Romania I have read that Bulgarians were present at the ethnogenesis of both nations, you were our neighbors before we came West, and you lived together with Vlachs in the time of the Second Bulgarian Empire. The Ottoman era of the Balkans is completely blank for me and I just started to look up the Balkan Wars, but I admire Bulgaria for being on the right side in both World Wars, and on the less degenerate side in the Cold War. It is also interesting that you had the same FRIENDSHIPISM we Hungarians had when you have united different subjects in one proto-nation. Byzantium is also a big topic I have to study in the future, but I like the concept of Supranational Empires, so that's also an interesting part of your history for me.

	As for the present, I know that Bulgaria is one of the poorest countries in Europe and it was a pain in the ass to see how the Bulgarian government fucked up the South Stream what would have been a little slap in the face of the EU, but I can't blame your nation for that since as Zmajevit said, there are no independent nations anymore.

	There are some places I want to see in Bulgaria, like the <a href="http://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/buzludzha-communist-monument-bulgaria.jpg" rel="external nofollow">Buzludzha Monument</a>, the <a href="http://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/plovidv-bulgaria-monument.jpg" rel="external nofollow">Hillock of Fraternity</a> or the <a href="http://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/varna-bulgaria-communist-monument.jpg" rel="external nofollow">Monument of the Bulgarian-Soviet FRIENDSHIP</a>. I am a big fan of brutalist architecture.

	All in all, Bulgaria looks like a 'good Serbia' for me. :D It is located in the Balkans, it has an Empire in the Middle Ages, but right now is poor, but it has the same nomadic past as Hungary and always fought on the right side, just like Hungary.
