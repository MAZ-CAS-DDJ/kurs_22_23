	That's the point. It was not marxism. It was some sort of leftist nationalism. There was no crime at all, laws were very strict and degeneracy was myth. Yes people lived rather humble compared to the Westerners but I think it was worth it. Of course the commie years brought a lot of negative things but you can't really deny that it brought some nice things to us. Russian people are overall conservative, however in the recent years the women got the image for cheap and gold digging whores and the men being constantly drunk and agressive. It is true to a degree - we got a lot of tourists on the Black Sea and only the english neanderthals are above the russian in alcohol consumption and overall trouble making. Usually, I am not very fond of Russians but most of them are good hearted people that were unlucky with their chieftains.

	Yea, men and women are completely different 'built' organisms. Each gender has its own specific fuctions, so to say,  but with the whole reversing of the roles the mess got really huge. Men became sensitive ( from what I've seen on magazines, mass medias, internet), caring, tolerant. Masculinity was degraded down to macho pose and labeled unattractive and so on. And the women - well, i'm certain you know what happened. The whole feminism thing was introduced here few years ago.

	It seems so. I've spoken with a lot of people and got the impression that the universities in the West are absolute cancer. Not that our profs here are not crazy but not in a way of pushing this crap. In my opinion, even Christianity can't save you fully from this poisonous influence. Even though, us the Orthodox ones are, in my humble opinion, the sanest Christians I find it simply not enough. That of course happened when I adopted the NS views. I think, if you are willing to learn you can learn a lot here. The good thing is that the board is full with info and the tone is not pretentious like other places - Stormfront which is very popular in the US and is surprisingly apathic at the same time.
