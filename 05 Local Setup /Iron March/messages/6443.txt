<p>The Traditional Britain Group is something of an enigma to me, at the moment it's employing the rhetoric and style of High Toryism. However, many of the people who turn up to its functions are bread and butter nationalists and/or conspiracy theorists. The handful of young people who are at the heart of the Group are clearly much more radical than their Catholic Professor-style seniors in that they're interested in, and motivated by, outright Traditionalism and the European New Right. It's because of this youthful element, and this alone, that I have become a member. After all, when GRECE was established most of its primary members were in their twenties. But it would be foolish, and unfortunately non-English, to do away with aesthetic continuity entirely. One needs the cult of the gentle vicar and emerald fields. But you're right, we must develop a <em>style </em>and a <em>substance </em>that work with our inheritance but refuse to be eternally bound to its limitations. </p>

<p>Countless movements have attempted to import foreign doctrines and ideologies to this country, the result of this has been the fostering of a nationalistic, and niche, sub-culture which alienates its own market; its very own nation! Thus, we must Anglicise Continental imports whilst, at the same time, refusing to submit to the petty prejudices of our own tribe. It's always a question of dialectically transcending the extremes and reaching a much needed synthesis; as both Nietzsche and Hegel would have appreciated. The Chairman of the Group, who I believe is now in his late twenties, expressed to me his desire for a synthesis between the more radical tendencies and the better elements of conservatism. I appreciate the mentality, but concepts such as Archeofuturism render all conservatisms moribund. Providing a people remain in touch with the archaic, that is the eternal in man, one will inevitably give birth to the institutions conservatives always ramble on about. We're not for the Windsors, but we are for hierarchy and authority and therefore, potentially, monarchy. We're not for the parliamentary game, but we are for localism, subsidiarity and thus democracy as the Athenians knew it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Values before institutions! - This is our mantra and it's what separates us from the conservative denominations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In terms of my broader views as to what must be done, and vanguardism, the following points represent the crux of my thought:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1) The state's apparatus, its institutions and secondary zones of influence, is being used to facilitate the destruction of our people. The process is sub-conscious and is not driven by a mysterious "They" but rather the culminating fusion of globalist tendencies, the anthropological implications of the market society (Massification, social atomisation and neo-primitivism) and the weight of constantly supplied and reused language and imagery. Because of these phenomenon, it's impossible to penetrate the parliamentary game or to utilise legislation, bills and institutions that may well have once served our people. Thus, reform is no longer possible. The Royal Family, the Houses of Parliament and the Armed Forces are lost to us; we must imagine a world, an England, without them.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2) The state of the United Kingdom aside, the nation-state has failed the European peoples and is no longer capable of being a serious world-actor following the conclusion of Modernity. Consequently, some form of European unification is a necessity. Guillaume Faye's Eurosiberian ideal is just that, an ideal to be worked towards. England must reposition herself in civilisational terms, and swiftly. The Anglo-sphere has become a shattered dream and we must surrender any hope of re-imagining our own sub-civilisation such as that we enjoyed during the days of Empire. But, we must not allow French and Continental disdain for Anglo-Saxon empiricism compel them towards the imagined Paris-Berlin-Moscow geopolitic. The French New Rightists still suffer from a Jacobin attitude, even when supposedly struggling against it, they often don't take the differences between the European peoples seriously; such talk of a European 'nation' is a phantasm. The primacy of Russia in such a union is also to be questioned and sapped; Europe needs her, but Russia still exhibits the petty chauvinism that compelled our brother peoples to slaughter each other in the early 20th century.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>3) Capitalism, especially under it's so called 'Free-Market' form, has proven itself to be infinitely more harmful to our people than communism ever was. Alain de Benoist has been right to suggest that it is a great irony that the Old Right defends precisely the economic system that destroys all that which they admire on a social level. Our rule must be to avoid all forms of economism and to fight belief in Homo economicus where ever we find it. Economics must be made subservient to both politics and culture. But, alas, what is a movement without a definitive economic approach? We must explore the two-tier concept as laid out by Faye, and we must work towards Autarky of Vast Spaces; world trade must be broken. However, because a spontaneous victory across the continent is beyond unlikely, it'll be necessary for individual European nations, united under our movement, to come up with a temporary preliminary system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4) We must proclaim a Continental party, an intellectual tendency is required first, of course, but we must learn from the Internationale of the Communists. We need one party to span across the Continent, we need it be rendered recognisable via one symbol and we need to engineer a new breed of professional revolutionaries who are competent in theory, ideology and multiple languages. I am convinced, utterly so, that England can become something of a fortress above the Continent; a leading European power once again. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for your suggestions stemming from the inversion concept, I think the concept is intriguing. I shall reserve commenting for now until you've painted the full picture. But such reasoning shall inevitably become central to our movement. </p>
