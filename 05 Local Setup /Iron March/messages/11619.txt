<p>yeah, they look like shades or shadow figures and only vaguely human, and no eyes</p>
<p> </p>
<p>sometimes they would sit on my chest, but usually they just lean over my bed and they stare at me with their empty sockets, and scream at me</p>
<p>i only vaguely remember some of the things they say to me but one of them was "prepare for your doom"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>sometimes they just stand in the corners while i cant move or anything, thats almost worst. very unsettling..</p>
<p> </p>
<p>thats pretty awful, i actually recorded my worst nightmare because i remembered it well. it was... weird, and different</p>
