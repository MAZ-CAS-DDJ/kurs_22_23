<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div><p>I have been pouring over your fascinating post on AH's personality.  The post is akin to a decade's worth of birthday presents: alluring yet substantive simultaneously; brimming with insight; chocked with tidbits. So full of points and personal opinions, I have not yet thought my comments through fully but, I felt, you deserve at least an initial reply which may engender message exchanges.</p></div></blockquote>

<p>Well I am grateful for this but I have really just illustrated some of the central points of David Irving's primary source on hitler. He really did all the historical work while I for the most part have taken his word for it; he is of course  the best historian in the field without doubt, but there is a lot of what he says where serious questions can be raised. For example Hitler's lack of knowledge on the implementation of the final solution, his 'moderated' antisemitism being anything other than a political ploy. Those things I didn't even mention because they are unbelievable. If you want a good read get the unabridged version of Hitler's War (the one at the Central Library of Philadelphia is abridged. You can definitely get it uncensored online but reading online hurts your eyes.) The very first post on the first page of the thread also has a lot of insightful material, though it is of course also online.</p>

<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div><p>He did however, as with Hitler, master the art of communication and later in his life, polish his personality for British consumption: had he learned something from Hitler during the mid '30's? In my opinion, certainly. Churchill, I feel, worked furiously, as part of his personal agenda, to dis-credit Chamberlin's attempts at negotiating with Hitler and, as we know, directly or otherwise, that Churchillian objective was met.</p></div></blockquote>

<p>There really couldn't be more of a stark difference between leaders as with Churchill and Hitler. Hitler was an intellectual among the working class, had a sincere love of his country, and was revered by those who earned his confidence. Churchill a drunk bloke from the aristocracy who had absolute loathing for almost everyone in the world, not a care for his nation or empire, someone who's class chauvinism was loathed even by the members of his class. Hitler gave his entire life to his race, Churchill sold his empire for fame. If you read 'Churchill Hitler and the Unnecessary War' that will shed light on those differences, even though in a very subtle way, and how they effected the start of the war. If you don't have the time for that, there's a good interview with the author (Patrick Buchanan, former Republican presidential candidate) on youtube, and there is this great <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/340-regulation-18b-and-the-second-world-war/?p=4125" rel="">talk</a> by Ben, though it is interrupted by our official autists.</p>

<p>in essence Churchill deliberately helped fuel the bloodiest war in history in order to make himself into some hero of moral fortitude, and that is exactly what these conservative cunts give to him. Chamberlain was a weak liberal leader and an even weaker diplomat, as a result of which British interests most likely suffered, but at the very least he wasn't a clinical narcissist or a conniving jew rat.</p>

<p>The Nazi's would've been vilified anyway because they ran in the face of the Jewish plans of cultural revolution and world government, which is evidenced enough by the fact that their boycott didn't work. Germany had been the worst of the worst in the 20s, only America today is more Judaic and degenerate. Indeed we owe it to the Germans more than anyone else that world government wasn't totally secured until the 90s and still in the subtle way that it has been. the National Socialists were men and nationalists from the great race of Europe; all eyes were on Germany to be the nation that would dominate the 20th century the way England had the 19th. This is why they are the great evil we have to leave behind in the past; they are the most glorious example of white men breaking free and not being led by their noses. They were our realest chance of victory. If they had been an inch more lenient that inch would become an angle for their enemies. In fact they were quite lenient at the beginning and experience accumulated from this turned them against it.</p>

<p>How exactly have they solved the Jewish problem? on what earth do you live? How exactly don;t the jews control everything? How exactly didn't the allies partake in a genocide worse than their so-called holocaust, in which almost all of the actual deaths were caused by allied bombing of agriculture and infrastructure as well?</p>

<p>See "the Dilema" "Molotov" Hitler's war. really a glance at a map of Europe and the national character of Russian and Germany in 1933 would tell you that war was really inevitable.</p>

<p>Holy fuck Vlad, you continue to be a treasure trove of information and, sincere, thanks for all this.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am turning in...NJ time... and imagine you are further west.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before doing so, I have to comment  briefly on:</p>
<p>- the Jewish solution. It is EMPHATICALLY not solved, nor do I feel that I wrote that, but that the 3 main Allies tended to agree and shoved the kikes into their created state of Israel, thinking it would resolve the matter but merely kicked the can down the road, leaving us to suffer their continued existence; and</p>
<p>- the failure to eliminate Soviet communism, while true that speculating what the world would be like without these commie cunts, we can but have the occasional dream.   </p>

<p>I promised a reply today but did not anticipate the crap at work today for 14 hours.  However, clutching my bottle of Scotch:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- I looked for local library David Irving books and found, in this Republican/Jewish ghetto area of southern NJ, but 1 covering Hitler's Germany from 1933-1939.  I will endeavor to get the other 2 from my main local library on Hitler and Churchill - they have a decent arrangement with Princeton Uni for borrowing. I even managed a few years ago to get an obscure book on Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe this way - forgive me, I know, but I find him an interesting nigger.  Back to Irving...although he is vilified in the mass trite called media, he was the one that exposed the "Hitler Diairies" as nothing but forgery and, what thanks does he get?  Zero;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- in the turmoil of the day, I did happen to notice, but did not read it, that there is new assessment of Chamberlain that paints him, in the Brit perspective, in a more positive light.  I agree with you that he was a weak negotiator and, had he been stronger, then lives would have been very different for us all. Although I am a Brit. and a nationalist for that country, I wish that Chamberlain - or Mosley had the drunk enabled him to - negotiated peace with the Reich.  Failing that, had Hitler had the balls to invade the island and succeeded - as imo he would have through over-whelming might once across the Channel, I think that the nation would have accepted fascism and become decent adherents;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- The Goyles thread link - I assume that is Ben - regarding warmongering WSC from Nov 2011 was great and I doubt I would have found it without your help: thank you. I find it re-assuring that another Brit in Goyles has a loathing for that national kike loving drunken slob. In fact I attempted to send Goyles a PM just to thank him but, it appears, one cannot PM Admin - shit, but understand;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- As for the aural link on Roosevelt, this merely re-enforced my views on the cripple. There is another demi-God who should be torn to shreds, running rampant through the US constitution and working with the Soviets and Brits whilst hiding behind the mask of neutrality;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- on the kike matter, I heartily agree with your summary although, I think, that the Semitics brought about a world government earlier than the 1990's....more like by a decade earlier with then rapid erosion of global capital movement.  As for the 1920's, Germany got properly FUCKED in the 1919 Versailles Treaty....with Wilson, Lloyd-George (with WSC in tow) and Clemenceau all having Jewish advisers at their sides, as well as serving their own national interests. I feel that the kikes advising prevented the already growing idea of shunting their kith into a homeland in Palestine: now, had that happened in the 1920's, well, we can but speculate;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- on the matter of leniency towards the scummy Judes by Germany, you remind me of Plato and his reference to the failures of might not enforced as being perceived as weakness in the matter of the Melians.  You are either with us or against us, as it were. I still, however, feel that, while not recognized at the time, the concentration camps were and continue to be the millstone around the neck of National Socialism;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- as for the Reich emulating the Brit Empire of the 19th C., go back to the time of Bismark and see how he was trying, sometimes succeeding, in getting the nation out of the proverbial geographical box the Brits, and French, had placed Germany in.  Only in what is now Namibia and Tanzania was the German nation given some toleration; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- the German race is a glorious thing. I lived there from late '87 - early '93 just inside Bayern in a town called Aschaffenburg. This is what finally enforced by views on the rights of fascism and the adjunct National Socialism. I meet former veterans of the Wehrmacht and others who had merely lived and worked during the '30s and '40s and all, some quietly, bemoaned the way German ideals were since the war being watered down, then by the Turks (and Islam) in particular. The time of Hitler was a time of pride in working for the nation with economic &amp; social principles that served the nation as a whole, all the while resolving the financial burdens of Versailles. The progression was outstanding and something democracies cannot achieve.  I distinctly re-call a response to a German friend of my age during this time - so born circa 1960 - to a question of mine that basically said, if are nations were at war and we met each other, how would you re-act. Without a hesitation, his reply was "Kill you for the betterment of Germany."  And, no, he was not a fascist but loved &amp; took pride in his nation.   It did teach me not to ask a stupid question!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On that note, I look forward to, perhaps, a plethora of future viewing and reading suggests.</p>
