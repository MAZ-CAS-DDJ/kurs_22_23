<p>Remember that e-book I sent you when I came clean about not actually being a Christian? Maybe it was Ben, I can't remember... anyway, I think there's something good to be learnt from it, right near the start of the book, it's not only fascinating on a religious or spiritual viewpoint, but also a racial one.</p>
<p>Hitler speaks of miscegenation in Mein Kampf also, the mix is half way between the two races, it is to the detriment of the superior and only of slight benefit to the inferior but it loses the fine tuned qualities of the two races. There are also the spiritual and most importantly the mental effects tied to race mixing which are damaging. One such set of experiments which is highly interesting for MANY reasons are these ones:</p>

<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>Epicurus believed as myself, that a genetic memory had been forged into our brains from the most ancient of times and for this reason we find the Gods familiar and fascinating to us. The fact that people<p>all over the world have the same legends and myths of these times displays a common source. Epicurus called this "prolepsis," which he wrote of in his STANDARD OF JUDGMENT, of the inborn knowledge of the mind that today we call genetic memory.</p>

<p>There was also a book written a long time ago which I believe was way ahead of its time (the Christian theology and slants aside), it said the same thing along these lines. I cannot for the life of me remember the title of the book, but I do have it on my comp somewhere.</p>

<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>EUGENICS is the science of applying the Laws of<p>Genetics toward the improvement of races and breeds. Mankind</p>
<p>is capable of passing favorable genetic characters to succeeding</p>
<p>generations, while eliminating many unfavorable</p>
<p>qualities. Man can achieve even more extraordinary results</p>
<p>than he has in the breeding of grains, fruits, vegetables, flowers,</p>
<p>livestock, horses and pets. Don't let this shock you. Man</p>
<p>IS part animal. Therefore, let us examine some of Mankind's</p>
<p>breeding practices.</p>
<p>INBREEDING has been practiced since the beginning</p>
<p>of human history. It refers to the mating of close relatives:</p>
<p>parents and siblings, brothers and sisters, and first cousins.</p>
<p>Contrary to Distorters the only injury from inbreeding</p>
<p>results from defective inheritance received: defects which</p>
<p>persisted in the stock for many generations but were hidden</p>
<p>by more dominant characters. Successful inbreeding requires,</p>
<p>for one thing, that defectives be prohibited from breeding.</p>
<p>Instead of being condemned (inbreeding) should be commended.</p>
<p>After continued inbreeding - with the discarding of</p>
<p>undesirables - an in-bred stock has been purified and rid of</p>
<p>abnormalities, monstrosities, and serious weaknesses...</p>
