<p>Several issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>There was but one primordial race that followed the solar principles and that was the Hyperboreans/Aryans. They traveled the world North to South, West to East and conquered other local races, all of which were following the lunar principles. In their conquest of these other races they imposed their own solar practices.<br>	 </li>	<li>The point is that the Solar principle is a higher and more proper comprehension of spirituality, a positive, empirical and proactive one where you can engage the spiritual world, whereas the Lunar principle is inferior due to being passive and reliant COMPLETELY on blind faith making them but an object onto which the spiritual world acts.<br>	 </li>	<li>You don't get the point of the symbolism itself.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Last point is where your confusion is from. Solar direction doesn't deny the existence of lunar elements because the world is indeed divided into material and immaterial parts, Solar recognizes both and sees their interaction, placing primacy on the immaterial world and thus you have the symbols that reflect the nature of their interaction in its various forms, the proper one where solar powers dominate and the degenerate form where the lunar powers dominate. Lunar direction is the one that celebrates and desires that material world is either all there is or that it takes primacy while bastardizing the immaterial part (what evola described as feminization of the spiritual and materialization of the masculine). So Lunar by definition is IMBALANCE whereas Solar is balance. Solar = Masculine, Lunar = Feminine. Solar/Masculine takes the role of the immovable mover, the center that by its mere existence forces everything around it to move, whereas the feminine is the chaotic energy that without the center has no direction, so in the primacy of the Lunar you get chaos, with the primacy of the Solar you give chaos form and order.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus your improper utilization of the yin and yang symbolism that has nothing to do with saying both lunar and solar directions exist in some harmony, its an entirely SOLAR SYMBOLISM, conceived by those who followed the SOLAR tradition and utilized to symbolize the relations in its own, correct, order of Solar primacy.</p>

<p><em>In traditional symbolism, the supernatural principle was conceived as "masculine" and the principle of nature and becoming as "feminine." In Hellenic terms the "one", which is "in itself", complete, and self-sufficient, is regarded as masculine. Conversely, the dyad, the principle of differentiation and of "other-than-self," and thus the principle of desire and of movement, is regarded as feminine. In Hindu terms (according to the Samkhya darsana), the impassible spirit (purusa) is masculine, while prakrti, the active matrix of every conditioned form, is feminine. The Far Eastern tradition has expressed equivalent concepts through the cosmic duality of yin and yang, whereby yang, the male principle, is associated with "virtue of heaven" and yin, the feminine principle, with the principle of the "earth."</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>"A second type of civilization must also be considered. The pair always come first. There is, however, a crisis, and the feminine primacy is upheld through a new principle, the Aphrodistic principle. The mother is replaced by the hetaera, the son by the lover, and the solitary virgin by the divine couple that, as I have suggested, in various mythologies often characterizes a compromise between the opposite cults. But the woman in this context (unlike in the Olympian synthesis) is not Hera, who was subordinated to Zeus although always scheming behind his back; we do not even have, as in the Far Eastern synthesis, the yang principle that retains its active and heavenly character vis-a-vis the yin principle, which is its feminine and earthly compliment.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Instead, the chthonic and infernal nature penetrates the virile principle and lowers it to a phallic level. The woman now dominates man as he becomes enslaved to the senses and a mere instrument of procreation."</em></p>

<p><em>"Thus the ritual alludes to visions in which the cosmic septenary is first experienced in its immanent aspect, then in its transcendent aspect; first, in its aspect of "passive reflection" (the yin of Chinese tradition), and then in its aspect of "active perfection" (the yang) and of "foundation." "</em></p>

<p><strong>Metaphysics of Sex:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<div><em>"For example, in the traditional teachings of the Far East, when a man and woman meet, even without any physical contact, a special energy or immaterial "fluid" called tsing is aroused in the deepest layers of their beings. This energy springs from the polarity of the yin and the yang, which we provisionally define as the pure principles of female and male sexuality.  This energy, tsing, is a specification of the radical, vital force tsri and grows in proportion to the degree of yang and yin present in man and woman. This special magnetically induced force has as its psychological counterpart the state of diffused intoxication, vibration, and desire proper to human eros. "</em></div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>"By means of all this we have already come close to the concept of that "magnetic differentiated atmosphere proper to individuals of different sexes" of which we spoke before. In Far Eastern terms this is a question of the yang and yin principles, which penetrate both the inner being and the material body of man and woman under the form of a fluid and an elementary molding energy."</em></div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>"In traditions of the Far East, however, the metaphysical dyad is characterized by the yang and yin, which are understood as being elementary determinations and also real forces acting on every plane of being. When understood as determinations, yang has the nature of </em></div>
<div><em>the Sky and everything active, positive, and male, whereas yin has the nature of the Earth and everything passive, negative, and female. In graphic symbolism a continuous line corresponds to yang, whereas a broken line corresponds to yin, indicating the idea of the "two" and, therefore, of the Platonic power of the "other." The trigrams and hexagrams formed with various combinations of those two elementary signs are given by the I Ching, the fundamental text of Chinese tradition, as the keys to the essential situations that reality may display in a spiritual or natural category of the universe, as well as in the human, individual, and collective sphere. All phenomena, forms, beings, and changes of the universe are considered at the level of various encounters and combinations of the yin and yang; from this they take their final characterization. From their dynamic aspect yang and yin are opposed but also complementary forces. The light and the sun have a yang quality , whereas shadow and the moon have a yin quality. Fire is yang, the waters are yin; mountain tops are yang, the plains are yin; the spirit is yang, the soul and vital force are yin; the pure is yang, the unfathomable yin; and so on. Lastly, it is the predominance of yin in woman and of yang in man that make them what they are: at this level the pure yin and pure yang appear as the substances of absolute womanhood and absolute manhood respectively. Besides the aspects of symbolism that take us back to the other writers we have already examined in Hellenic tradition, it is worth noting at this stage the attribution of the cold, wet, and dark qualities to yin and of the dry, clear and light qualities to yang. The cold quality of yin might seem a contradiction of the aspects of heat, flame, and life already examined in the female principle, but it should be interpreted in the same context as the cold light of the moon and the coldness of goddesses like Diana who personify the principle of that light; and we can see the importance of this passage in the study of the feminine character and of woman. To the yin, therefore, belong shadows and the darkness with regard to elementary powers prior to form, which correspond in the human </em></div>
<div><em>being to the unconscious and to the vital, nocturnal part of his psyche. That takes us directly back to the relationship that was acknowledged to exist between female divinities and divinities of the night and of the depths of the earth, the night of Hesiod, presented as the mother of the day. Here the day is equivalent to the clear, light ("sunny") quality of the yang, which is the very quality proper to manifested, definite, and completed forms that are released from the equivocal darkness and from the indeterminate nature of the generative womb and female substance or raw material."</em></div>
<div> </div>
<div>So the correct balance is one where Solar elements dominate the Lunar, it doesn't mean lunar elements don't exist, it means that they are subjugated to the solar elements.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And since this correct order prevails in ALL things then it is likewise applied to everything, including social structure and individuals in their respective manifestations. </div>
