<p>You know... if it was, say, winter, year or so back, after this statement I would have unplugged mah PC and never visited IM again. Now. Now is fucking summer, it's hot as hell, and I don't care. I am pretty sure you won't be getting my direct address, and if you did... Well, send in some vodka of yours. At least it's not that benzin brother product that russians dare to sell (I hope). But I guess I'll have to 'thank' jewcom of Litauen for their dedication so that western vodka wouldn't reach me.</p>
