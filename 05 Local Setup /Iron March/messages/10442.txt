<p>Today, well, I don't think so, my grandfather was an officer, and he did not know Serbian.</p>
<p>Back in the days of the Ottoman Empire, I think it was customary to know the Croatian language, which I believe is very similar to Serbian language, but other than that, language requirements for the Turkish army nowadays probably include knowing English.</p>
