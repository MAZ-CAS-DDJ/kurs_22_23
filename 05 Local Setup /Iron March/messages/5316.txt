<p>Would you be interested in being an officer for the NBU? You would be responsible for your home state and for the time being, until we grow stronger, the region around it.  We could really use someone with your enthusiasm and speaking abilities. Of course I would have to clear it with the leadership first, but I don't anticipate any objections.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As far as the direction of the American operations go I have some ideas I need to talk with Gary about but there hasn't been much action to date. All of the ideological positions you brought up above are applicable to what we're doing and what we believe. I don't think we should emphasize one above the rest. It would depend on what's hot at the particular moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I think the wordpress site is a great idea. When you have it up and running make sure to promote here and I'll do what I can on Facebook.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the meantime if you have any ideas on how to promote the NBU here in the states I would love to here them.</p>

<p>I have just made a donation to NBU on the website - although it purported to be Eleanor Urquahart Dog Beds. I sure as hell hope the STG 50 went to the correct place!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On ideological positions I mention, all is clear and understandable with your reply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had not thought of using the WordPress on Iron March but that is a neat idea.  On the matter of the WordPress Blog, I imagined taking a position on fascism in general and, as an adjunct, using it for the NBU. Do you concur? Assuming you do, I feel I should include Constitutional NBU information after a few blogs but, if I did, it would need tweaking for the US, imo - see, for example, section 2.1.  A similar set of comments goes for the Recruitment Leafer where even more adapting is, surely, required.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On promoting the NBU, I do, strongly, believe that a NBU America page is desirable. I have actually just thought of a way we could do this on facebook: form a fb "group" page, that is open but for which through the settings, limited as to whom can join and what is posted in an effort to keep the message focused and distinct.  What do you think?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On other matters of social media, a Twitter account I feel could be interesting to see how it goes but, until I can check tomorrow from work, I am un-certain whether or not it feeds back into existing Twitter pages - I "tweet" as well for the business. I will let you know on this, unless you advise me to forget it as being somewhat futile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As I have mentioned, I think networking with existing members is desirable. As you have not referenced any specifics on members other than checking with Gary, forgive me, but I suspect that the US based membership is low. If this is correct, I can understand and it only circles back, in part, to my comment about having national specific material. For Gary and those in the UK, this is far from a priority but.....  I do also appreciate the caution of passing out e-mail contacts for members, regardless of where they are.  This then partly provokes me to ask if, bar you, I and Gary/NBU, there are any NBU members in Iron March.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a tool for the NBU in the USA, what about other forums - Stormfront for example. I am not a member and have not got my head around that page from the occasional quick skim of it over the past few months. I am also not sure it is quite right for the NBU but I bow to your knowledge on the matter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taking this matter of ideas and considerations further, allow me to pose the question as to how well Mosley is known in the US to anyone but a fervent follower (of him and fascism)?  I ask this as I wonder if the focus on him in existing NBU literature and media postings is right for us here and, perhaps, the emphasis should be on fascism and what it truly means.  Again, you'd know more than I both on the matter of Mosley's "name recognition" and the finessing of the subject to an American audience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, on your opening remark, offering me a position as an Officer. Is this a position as a Divisional or a District Officer, considering how you phrase the offer covering NJ and the region around it?  On the matter of "region around it", I am assuming NJ (or at least central &amp; southern), DE, eastern PA and perhaps northern MD I am, naturally, flattered by the offer and would be proud in having either title, certainly at so short a juncture.  I checked the NBU website and in the Contact drop-down in Site Area, I see the listing of District, Divisional and National officers e-mails, alongside their name.  I would require that if listing me there that the NBU use either my new yahoo e-mail with is newjerseyfascist@yahoo.com OR SJINBU1514@mail.com but NOT the e-mail address I signed-up to the NBU with, iredale1@verizon.net.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sincere thanks for the officer offer and the time that you have given me so far. Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PS: 3  points -</p>
<p>1) any recommendations on Mussolini;</p>
<p>2) did you see in your fb "News Feed" my "Like" of Black Shirts as I am curious to learn who is being notified /seeing what among my fb friends; and</p>
<p>3) switching-off from the subject at hand, would you care to fb "Like" my business page, Medford Florist?</p>
