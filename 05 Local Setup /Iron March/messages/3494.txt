<p>Went through and read the thread on Pinochet, never put much thought into him but the man was amazing. Did a little research. Now that sounds like my kind of leader! Rounding up the communist traitors and wiping out cultural and political dissidents while forcibly deregulating the economy. That's great. His economic advisers were all from the Chicago school and studied under Friedman. And then, what is even better, is people are shocked when Chile sky rocketed in quality of life, particularly for the middle class, and how their economy boomed. When a country in the third world hell hole that is South America can have such rampant success, you know they are doing something right.</p>
