<p>Freedom is the biggest buzzword. For some reason it doesn't include the freedom to pick the people I want to hire and live with. Nor I have the freedom from current media bs. For example Google always pushes the rainbow flags and all that crap in your face without giving an option to not having to see that thing. It is cute to see that they worry about the gays in the Middle East but they basically never mention the Christians there who have it way worse thanks to the current bandit of the day. For my country I would pick a policy of neutrality when it is not in our interest. Because I really don't see why we had to send troops to Iraq, Afghanistan. Even our presence in Kosovo is a bit shady. <br /><br />Fun fact in Hungarian that place was called "Rigómező" and we fought the Turks there in the 1400s.</p>
<p>And the Serbs had battles with the Turks in the 1300s...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I miss the time when we actively fought Kebab instead of inviting it over and letting it rape and outbreed us. ie. All of fucking western and northern Europe.</p>

<p>haha</p>

<p>Gypsies are one of a kind I have to say. The ones that you can see as the low tier are stinky, breed like animals and have zero care about their environments.</p>

<p>I see. That doesn't sound good. I'll be honest I am seeing the US as a totally lost cause. No offense but seeing what american companies and media does.... I didn't knew that the US is mobilizing internally. That is an interesting turn of events! Maybe they are buzzing about the gay marriage to mask the news about that and the bad economy!</p>

<p>Ferguson was a joke people in Europe too protested. It was so pathetic. "hurr racist cop killed innocent G". Then the liberals and the media put oil on the fire. Have I mentioned that I hate the mainstream media? haha</p>
