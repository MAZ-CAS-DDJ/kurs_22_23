<p>As I said. Malta isn't horrible. It's just that there are many prevalent problems (which show even more because of our small size) which aren't getting fixed with the current parties and groups. It's the same in the rest of Europe, from what I hear on this forum.</p>
<p>The parties in Australia seem to be more or less like the ones here. I would've expected there to be some major nationalist parties and movements in Australia, especially considering the influx of Asian migrants. Is the education system in Australia filled with Liberal teachers and books like most of America and Europe?</p>
