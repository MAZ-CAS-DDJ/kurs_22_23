	What really irked me was the reds targeting my parents, both elderly and infirm and neither political in anyway, yeah, I was in the paper week after week as the bastard journalist presumed a personal vendetta. It's all a long time ago (2003/4) but I told him that regardless of how long it took, if I ever seen him again it would end badly. The journo in Scotland, who was perusing a similar agends, I told the paper that if I contuned to be a target then I would put him in intensive care and that was an end to it.

	The group to which I and the informant was affiliated, Nov. 9, advised me that this was not their way of dealing with it and I should overlook the informant's transgression as he was a generous donor to the group. I subsequently joined BNSM &amp; have been a member ever since.
