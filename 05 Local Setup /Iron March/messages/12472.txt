<p>Hey Sturmgeist,</p>
<p>This is Blackshirt 13 here. I noticed your post in that bogus thread. You making fun of me now too? Are you now against me too? Anyways, to change the subject, I noticed when you posted that picture in trivial happening there was a poster that said Illinois. You go to school in Illinois? Anyways, thanks for your time and please let me know if you get this.</p>
<p>Hail,</p>

<p>No, I'm in Edinboro, PA. Probably an internship poster on the bulletin board since this is a multi-union university.</p>
<p>Also, I'm against everyone. World Misanthropic National Edgelordism FTW Hail Satan Sieg Heil 666/88</p>
