<p>Thanks for reply. I said I would focus on true fascist ideals and building it around the cradle of the cause in Mussolini struck me as the best way to go.  I'll start to expand on points such as economics, culture, nation-building et cetera blog by blog. I will endeavor to not use "red flag" words such as Nazi, Hitler and will not yet venture into the public minefield of race et cetera. </p>

<p>As for the NBU, I'll bring them into it soon by way of Mosley.  I am holding off though for a short while for reasons of the audience ( ha, if any!) and as I am interested to see how the rally goes today and would the media, social and any possible UK mainstream, has to write.</p>

<p>Please, do share on your fb page.  Note that I will not like it as I do not wish to make it look all so obvious, certainly at this juncture.</p>
