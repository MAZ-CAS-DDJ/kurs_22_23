<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I just saw that you went on my profile. I am having difficulty fixing my avatar, every time I try to upload a picture it says that it failed to upload. I am going to prepare an introduction post for myself maybe tomorrow sometime.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Yea, you have to download it from the URL but I see you fixed that now. </p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="178" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Yeah, some things just don’t mix. Marxism and  Nationalism don’t really mix, and because Marxism reduces everything to just economics (as I explained to you in the past) Nationalism was bound to be pushed to the backseat – especially with all of those more Far-Left types on there like “Coach”. I actually read a few things by Marx and Engels which you may have not even read and I discovered that the Socialist Phalanx people misinterpreted Marxism; it is actually seriously anti-Nationalist at its core.</div></blockquote>
<p>Yes, even National Bolsheviks aren't genuine Marxist as much as they are Stalinists. I still respect the NazBol movement, as they don't go through all of Marx's writings and try to justify their views on them. If they see something Marx said as stupid they are not afraid to say so. If you look at the favorited videos on that new YT channel I sent you "Fascism - Borderless and Red" and the Ernst Niekisch video the ideologies are explained. It is much more Third Positionist and Nationalist. </p>

<p>"Germany Tomorrow" and "Hitler and I" are his major works. </p>

<p>The NazBols to a degree are inspired by Strasser but Strasser hated Bolshevism just as much as he did Western Capitalism. </p>

They not only genocide Palestinians, but they steal young women from Eastern Europe to sell them into prostitution, and they also steal organs from kids in Palestine and Eastern Europe. I saw an article once called “Israeli Organ Trafficking and Theft: From Moldova to Palestine.” Moldova is an ethnically Romanian nation that split off from Romania, but they are Romanians nonetheless! Read the article here:<p><a href="http://www.wrmea.com/component/content/article/321-2009-november/6602-israeli-organ-trafficking-and-theft-from-moldova-to-palestine.html" rel="external nofollow">http://www.wrmea.com...-palestine.html</a></p>
<p>Goddam Kikes never stop sucking off of us!</p>

<p>Might be good of you to point this out in the Palestine-Israel thread that recently came up. I posted in support of the Palestinians and got a bunch of people calling me "dune-coon sympathizer". Especially fascistcapitalist, that guy is really a curmudgeon. </p>
