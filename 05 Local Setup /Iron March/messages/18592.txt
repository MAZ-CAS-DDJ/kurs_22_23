	Yes, he steps over some fundamental questions about races in the midst of a very chaotic years to come. Italy can't just be Italy, every major train stations is filled with africans. Idk, but thanks for introducing me to the very interessing philosophy. But again to the racism: Africans clearly are more athletic so thats their quality and so on. Not really the best quality to have in our times tho'.

	In the end of the song he said my user name haha, tanrı türkü korusun. Just means "May God/Lord protect the Turks". A basic saying, but is popular to use for two reasons I think. 1) The use of Tanrı (and not Allah) and therefor Turkic oriented, 2) I guess it is written on some rocks written in ancient language. The song is about the Tanrı Dağları (Tian Shan), meaning Mountain of Heaven: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian_Shan" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian_Shan</a>. As it is written in the wiki-site, the mountains in this region is affiliated with <u><strong><span style="font-size:14px;">Tengriism</span></strong></u>.
