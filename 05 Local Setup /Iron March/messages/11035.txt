<p>They didn't say anything about the whole police involvement. I'm not supposed to know about it.</p>
<p>They gave me a restraint order against district property and a ban from all district services and property for 365 days. </p>
<p>I didn't know about the police involvement until the other guy who got searched told me what they told him. They said they notified the police of it and things like that. This was all after I got kicked out so not a word was said to me about it because Im not supposed to contact the other guy ever again and theyre taking special measures to make sure i cant see him in person. I didn't have anything "illegal" on my computer, just against district code, so police weren't involved for me. They're probably just checking in on me for safety, but probably are keeping a strong eye on him. </p>
<p>I went a bit off topic so basically I got a restraint order and ban for a year from district everything, I was told I cannot contact the other guy in any way, and the administration told me I was a liar and was refusing to tell the truth of the situation. The truth is though, the other guy was never involved. He just has a name similar to the guy online's username and so he was suspected. He's getting all this shit for no reason and they're making him a victim of democracy and corrupt law.</p>
<p>The director literally told him he would lose his job if he didn't expel him.</p>
