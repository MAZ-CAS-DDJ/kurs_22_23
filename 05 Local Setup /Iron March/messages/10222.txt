<p>thats a good outlook to have. I dont really hate christianity so I try not to mock it, even though I know Europe would be better off pagan, I accept that most of my kinsmen aren't ready for that yet. even though the imperium is very aesthetically christian it always struck me as having a pagan, specifically germano-roman outlook. </p>
