<p>Racial greetings.</p>
<p>Well, I used to read your blog The Archeofuturist. Sadly, it's not online anymore. I have copies of your articles "The Communitarian Neurosis and the Demographic Crisis", "Caste and Class" and "A Philosophy of Pain", but I remember there were many more. Do you have another blog? I ask you these questions because we (www.fni.cl) are preparing the third issue of Identitas, our white identity/archeofuturistic quarterly, and your articles liked me.</p>
<p>If I am not bothering you, could you send me your texts to my email? I will be glad to include them.</p>
<p>My email: fcojavgzo@gmail.com</p>
<p>Thanks and cheers from Chile.</p>
<p>Francisco</p>
