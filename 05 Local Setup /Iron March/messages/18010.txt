	Sieg Heil,
</p>

<p>
	you mentioned in the Esoteric Hitlerism Thread a research group. Can you give me some information how I can get involved in this?<br />
	I'm not a expert on Hinduism or other related topics, so I think I would rather be a disciple of the group but if it's possible I'd like to contribute and learn as much as possible with you guys.<br />
	If it's like a "secret" Skype group I have no problem if you may beÂ skeptical with a new user.
</p>

<p>
	I would be pleased to hear from you,
</p>
