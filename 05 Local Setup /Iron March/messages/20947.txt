	No I'm not MARSOC. Funny enough, I leave to PI in 2 weeks with an Infantry contract. You hinted at Special Operations command in "Western Provinces" so I only assumed that you were MARSOC. Thats the real deal though. I have a friend in AtomWaffen who's at Ft. Hood with the Army Engineers at the moment. He was in OEF. Hes on this site too, I can give you a way of contacting him if you want. If only you were up by me, I really need an Intel/Radio guy for my own group at the moment. The only Fascists I role with are ex-Military.
