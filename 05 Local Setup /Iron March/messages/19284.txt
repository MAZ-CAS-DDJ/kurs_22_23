	Judging by how construction of the southern border wall, and his incessant calls for 'unity' among a populous of cretins who hate him, I see very little to be optimistic about. At least France is camouflaged of sorts with all its neighboring socialist democrat states. Austria, The Netherlands, etc. I do feel bad that the French will have a particularly bloody fight, because of how entrenched muslims become, and because the common people can't really get ahold of guns. Thats one perk of the U.S, a low intensity, shadow war can be waged on the more criminal brownskins by blowing their heads off when they try to break into your home or property to steal from and kill you. This 'controversy' comes up the U.S occasionally, but its only an implicit deterrent. Europeans lack this.
