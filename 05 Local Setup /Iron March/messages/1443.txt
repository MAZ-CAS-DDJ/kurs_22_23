<p>William, I wanted to know what you'd think of the following correlation between personality types(and their subsequent disorders) and Party positions:</p>
<p>Choleric - Party leader(though a Psychopath could be suitable for this position too.)</p>
<p>Psychopath - Paramilitary leader</p>
<p>Melancholic - Propagandist</p>
<p>Histrionic - Agitator</p>
<p>Sanguine - Public Relations Administrator</p>
<p>Narcissist - Promoter(i.e.: Speech Giver)</p>
<p>Phlegmatic - Party Member</p>
<p>Borderline - Infiltrator(Though this one could be <strong>very </strong>tricky, so I doubt this could work.)</p>
