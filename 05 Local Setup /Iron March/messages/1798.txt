<p>Slavros,</p>
<p>I must ask for redress. I feel that your decision to permanently ban me is completely unjustified, as I have never advocated pedophilia, nor should my comments be construed as such. Simply because one can explain such behaviors from an evolutionary viewpoint does not justify their practice. What is natural is not necessarily what ought to be. To argue otherwise would be to commit the naturalistic fallacy. I ask that you reconsider this extreme decision, and I can guarantee never to comment on such matters in the future.</p>
<p>Yours respectfully,</p>
<p>NatCap</p>
