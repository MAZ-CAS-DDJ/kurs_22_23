<p>an early challenge when studying pagan myth is learning to have the pagan worldview, and part of this is how to view the gods. i still dont think anyone is entirely right including me haha. i was supposed to take psychology this year but my professor was some jewess cunt and dropped me from the class for being 1 minute late on the first day. *screams double internally*</p>
<p>oh well, i dont think i missed out on much. i flipped through the textbook it included such insightful information as</p>
<p>-nonreligious people dream more</p>
<p>-nonwhites have more developed pituitary glands</p>
<p>-dreams of flying symbolize sex</p>
<p>into the trash it went</p>
<p>i would recommend you go to east coast before west. i like the west just because ive lived here so long but its...weird. LA is degeneracy central. the desert has a certain wild beauty to it i guess but thats about it. and i know a few phrases in PG but just simple things that ive memorized from bracteates and other artifacts. I know a guy whos learning it all the way though. But those ones are my favorite words, they sound cool! Houaz and Thurisaz are my favorite words from that language. anglo saxon is quite different, a bit more gentle and poetic than some germanic languages. modern english sounds boring to me, but its my native language so thats to be expected. yeah thats true, could be coincidence. farmers are aryan though! im studying in college but honestly being a farmer sounds like a nice life. what do you want to do for a living? no im at a community college. i transferred from a university when i moved from alaska.  honestly i really miss that school in alaska, but i needed to move. i didnt mind the cold or bears, other reasons. yeah, i need to reread it sometime again. i remember relating so much to his biography that it drew me in, and his arguments in the second half sealed my belief in him. "3 occult books of philosophy". its pretty interesting, to be taken with a few grains of salt however. i mostly study it for the folk traditions contained in it. yeah it seems blond is more common with youth. when i was born my hair was platinum blond but it got darker over time. now its pretty much dirty blond, gets lighter in summer. dark brown hair  is pretty though</p>
