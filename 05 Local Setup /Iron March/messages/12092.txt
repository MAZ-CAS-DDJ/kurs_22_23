<p>Im well versed on the Aromanian or Vlach (we and they call themselves Vlachs over here) Question since I also hail from Pind and in a village surrounded by Aromanian settlements, so I have first hand experience. I am aware that it is really a sensitive matter and the reasons for it. As a matter of fact even here Aromanians are vocal nationalists, even from the foundation of the Greek State (2 of the three founders of the Filiki Etaireia were of Aromanian origin and many state benefactors). Anyhow as I said i recognized that the fighters of the Iron Guard were Aromanians, but I was mostly interested in the Greek minority that were non-Aromanians. I understand that they were hostilities against them from now and then, but judging that the Iron Guard did try to make some connections with Greek nationalist organizations, i was wondering if Greek emigres helped in those attempts...</p>
