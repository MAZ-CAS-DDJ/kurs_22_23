	Haha nice, the Deobandi are weird to me, I think they're Sufis but Salafis like them (hence the Taliban, which are Deobandi), they were founded in Delhi to resist British control of the subcontinent but have come to be the dominant ideology of the Taliban, aside from that I don't know much about them, cool that the imam opposed the kikes though.<br /><br />
	Also the dawah chat (Link: <a href="https://join.skype.com/RGwVldCdKFB0" rel="external nofollow">https://join.skype.com/RGwVldCdKFB0</a> ) is mostly Salafi, as Salafi fiqh seems the most logical to a lot of people including myself, Muhammed ibn Abdul Wahhab is a good place to start reading to get an understanding of this, I'm currently reading Ibn Taymiyyahs book on imaan, which is pretty good so far.<br /><br />
