<p>To be honest, it's just been a influx of miscreants lately. First Ben, then FC, now this commie comes slinking in. Makes my job more difficult than on I3PF, where the Admins could handle all this bullshit. I suppose I've become a bit purist with my mod powers, as I loathe the bickering that I'm beginning to see. More contempt floating around then usual. It makes a man unsure whether he should crack down or let it slide. I suppose none of this has much to do with you. Just blowing off steam. And keep this^ bitching between us, no? And try to be nicer to FC; by being civil in the face of his foolishness, you prove yourself the better man. Civility can be a biting blade if handled with care.</p>
<p>Kindly,</p>
