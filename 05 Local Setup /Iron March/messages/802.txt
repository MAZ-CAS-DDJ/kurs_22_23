<p>Hello Benjamin. About that post, where you quoted my letter. Could you delete some fragments from it, because some of those things shouldn’t go public. It is not the Ironmarch users that I’m worried about, but our party have had some experience when media takes something out of the context and makes big deal out of it. We are now very careful about our public image, because one mistake is all what the media needs. I have responsibility for my party not to do anything that would harm our image.</p>
<p>These are the things that are little dangerous and I would be grateful if you would take them out:</p>
<p>‘’Now we have became more ‘’friendly’’ to masses.’’</p>
<p>This just sounds too cynical.</p>
<p>‘’In this election our approach was like I said – friendly to masses.’’</p>
<p>This also.</p>
<p>‘’Many of them are not nationalists, just patriotic people, but it helps for our public image (as we are often portrayed as fascists (like it’s a bad thing  ) ).’’l</p>
<p>‘’At that time TB/LNNK had lost all its influence and we pretty much control our coalition. Corrupt politicians had to leave and when we will make a single party (in this autumn) it basically will be liquidation of old TB/LNNK. I predict that name and symbolism of united party will be ours.’’</p>
<p>Right now we are deciding about the new name and symbolism, propably It will be like I said, but In my letter I am too opened about it. </p>
<p>‘’Some in the party leadership say that we should start a mass movement for 4th national awakening (it’s also title of one of R.Dzintars books), where our party would be political wing of the movement, but there would also be choirs, sport clubs, paramilitary and other civic organizations committed to our goal – Latvia for Latvians. That’s also what I would like to see.’’</p>
<p>These plans definitely shouldn’t be known publicly.	</p>
<p>''Our liberal wing and radical wing often work on their own, instead just of being the different expressions of same spirit.’’</p>
<p>Public doesn’t need to know about our inner weaknesses.</p>
<p>‘’We cannot destroy the system, because it would be in the interests of Russians.’’</p>
<p>They would love to see that we even a consider possibility to destroy the system <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>I think without these things the meaning is still there and people get the idea what we are about. The rest is ok.</p>
<p>Thank you, </p>
