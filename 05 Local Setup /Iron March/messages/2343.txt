<p>As far as I'm concerned - Germany died in 1945 &amp; it has never seen resurrection since, and with its' death every bit of dignity our culture maintained. Everything we had, everything we created..we established the greatest empire of magnificence &amp; majesty this world has ever seen &amp; lost it to Communists, liberals, jews &amp; degenerates, while losing millions of our people..our women, our children..I look at what Germany is now..and it isn't there. The "German" is not there; there is but a lone "y". The spirituality of Germany, is not there; our land is majestic! From the teutonic forests to the hills of Hannover, our land is the most majestic in Europe &amp; the most defiled. </p>
<p>I literally don't know who I am as a German sometimes, and that breaks my heart.</p>
