About discrimination of polish minority. It's highly exageratted. Let's take an example: "If Lithuanians living in Poland asks for Lithuanian letters in Polish passports, would you agree?". It's more or less a political game for a couple of Polish Politics who are Populists to rise in power through these minorities. I was shauvinist against polish people 2 years ago, while I didin't knew anything about disastrous situation in Europe. But now, I don't feel any hate for those minorities. To summarize struggle of minority: if that minority respects laws and respects rules, there is no need for hate or any other atrocious actions. But if that minority wants some change in law and the majority of population is against it's hard to see how this can end peacefully or with a result there both sides would be happy.</span>

About uniting againat west and east: Baltic states, Balkan states and Poland with belarus should form some kind of defense pact against influence from east and west. After all I'm for Pan-European vision, where Europe is Europe of Nations, not some globalist European federation. </span>

About our movement: what we are doing is politics, it's just a different kind of politics. It's called meta politics, basically creation of propaganda, street action, etc. To become a political party might be a cause, but it's just too far in a future to even think about it. Our cause is to attract young people and red pill them, so they could become one of us, or achieve something better for our nation. </span>
