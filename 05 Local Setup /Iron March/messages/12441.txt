<p>Hey, you don't need to be so formal in all your messages.  I'm an Aussie, we hardly know the meaning of formal.</p>

<p>I'm not an expert on Mithras, and there's nothing weird about a fascination with Romans. I look at them with awe, and so did the Germans. As far as I know, there isn't any particular historical text involving the worship or rituals involved with the cult. The most I can advise is to try to stick with old books on the topic and archaeological evidence. If you're relatively new to paganism it's better to get a more general outline of the religion and the beliefs first, rather than delving into specifics. Writings of people living in that period of time are also incredibly useful, such as Marcus Aurelius.</p>

<p>I assume you're familiar with Evola. His works are useful when you make sense of them, same as the Havamal, Eddas and other Germanic texts I've suggested. Building up from the basics lets you get a better idea of the parallels and make sense of more complicated texts.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Varg Vikernes, his blog is a good foundation to learn about the practices and thoughts of the ancient Europeans, and his books are very interesting.</p>

<p>In the end, I see paganism as more of a worldview, rather than a religion, just like Fascism is a worldview rather than just an ideology. The two are completely compatible too. There's a reason the Nazis were interested in it and used a lot of symbolism, whether intentional or not.</p>
