	I know about the Islamization of the Albanians and the Bosniaks, but they were European people just like us (if I recall correctly, Bosniaks were some heretic sect from France, and the Albanians are the far relatives of Romanians). So I don't support their extermination, but I am sure we couldn't Catholicize them, so that's why I don't know what to do. Maybe that's just OK if they can sit on their asses, there are some Christian nations in Muslim territory also.

	Hohoho! So you are also against this anti-Pope! Thank God. I feared that you as a Catholic may be loyal to the pope, but now it's clear you also say Sede Vacante! I know some things about the Vatican II, it was really a Jewish occupation. :S How about the other Poles? Are they redpilled also in this question?

	Modernism is of course a denial of Christ, but ISIS and migration is also a denial of Islam, that's why most of the Sheiks are against it. I will show you also a video on that question:

	That's long, so maybe it's better if you download it as mp3 and bring it to work or to the gym. There is a much shorter stuff I found today (That's a Jobbik rally but what will you find at <strong>1:58</strong>?):
