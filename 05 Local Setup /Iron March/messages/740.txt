<p>I do not intend to rectify anything, I was just informing you that I was observing the IRC.</p>
<p>I didn't post that publicly in the relevant thread which should show that I am not intending to be malicious although I do want to correct you on one thing.</p>
<p>I didn't mock the concept, I merely said it was shocking.</p>
<p>Also, I would appreciate it if you would not talk to me in a condescending manner with comments such as "your friendly moderation staff"</p>
