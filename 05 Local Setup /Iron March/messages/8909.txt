<p>Yes, yes yes. I know exactly what you are talking about. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> I know it makes us sound a bit close to edgelord status, but I know what you mean. The normal reaction to people on our side is contempt- <em>lol what ignorant shitlords, i bet they were abused as children, Hitler only had one testicle. </em>That shit gets really boring. Being<em> </em>feared is even more fun than hated. Our enemies are really the most gutless group of people in all human history. If say... somebody introduced a credible threat of punishment for having a liberal opinion, these people would fold like lawn chairs and our problem would be solved.</p>

<p>But being feared, yes. I found it hilarious how much just the simple fact of you being a fascist will frighten somebody. I wrote a post (in... trivial happenings I think?) soon after I joined about an essay I wrote on Mosley and the BUF back when I was in school... and people's reactions to that... ach, I won't try to repeat it here, i will see if i can find the post to show you. But the point was basically faggots are so afraid of their own shadows that they will call the police over upsetting essays. I can tell why some join us just for that feeling.</p>

<p>Did I mention I was on the terror watch list and I got a visit from the feds? I'll try to find the bloody post...</p>

<p>I'm really rambly tonight huh? Yes you're a creep and I like having other creeps to relate to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aw, are corsets something you'd be into though, or is that not really your style? If I could guess you sound more folky to me.</p>

<p>Oh, and our blacks have the same problem, they stink. A very distinctive stench that all of them have. Mostly because they simply don't shower. Most live in the "long grass" as we say, I.E just camp outdoors in the bush. They only come into town to go to the centerlink office (that's aussie social welfare) and to the petrol (gas, lol) station to buy another bottle of petrol to sniff.</p>

<p>Ohh haha, I've seen that I think, it was on bestgore a while ago. Yeah, one thing you'll notice is that the eyes always seem to come out fine. It's a kind of meme over there. Eyes are a lot stronger than you'd think.</p>
