	Yeah, like I said I think I may just have slept on my neck wrong. But it is <em>sometimes</em> good to take a break though. Also, I think you are right, I guess it really will just come with time. It is just that society really makes you feel like a loser if you don't have a girlfriend. Of course, as I type this I just realized why should I give a shit about what the type of society which I am totally against, says anyways? Answer = I shouldn't and I don't. Also, sorry I had to ask to keep this discussion private as I know that you are a man of honor. I really had no right to ask this, it is just I have been burned on this in the past, *cough* Oakleaf *cough*. I think there is a fine line between hazing and just being an asshole. Also, yes I would like to know you thoughts on <em>The Sailor Who Fell From Grace</em> after you are done with it. Ha ha I always have fun discussing books with you my friend.

	PS I actually didn't get to play the game today because it is still installing! Man, laptops and gaming really don't go together at all. So, I guess tomorrow after work I'll play it. Also, I'll watch that Varg video on The Key to a good woman's heart as soon as I can :)
