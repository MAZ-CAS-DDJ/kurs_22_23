	I have read your comments and know about your origin, that's what I was referring to in the last paragraph of my first reply to you here. I can't speak for the Romanians, but here on IronMarch <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/5039-balkan-wars/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=167062" rel="">most of us are tired of the wannabes</a>. I don't think they would care about your blood as long as you have a minimal Romanian ancestry and more importantly you have serious intentions to integrate into the nation; but you will have to make sacrifices in order to do that - if you have read the writings of the CÄƒpitanul, you know that Romania is a poor country. If you will be able to return home, everybody will respect you, otherwise you are just another rootless roleplayer from Burgerland.

	I don't know too much about Romania, but it's certainly more than what the average Hungarians knows about it. I came here to see if I can work together with Romanians Fascists against the Chauvinism which is a threat to both of our nations, and thus is an enemy of Fascism.

	If I were you I would talk with <span><span><a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/13246-ironfalx/&amp;do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13246" href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/13246-ironfalx/" rel="">@IronFalx</a> and </span></span> <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/13289-primavera/&amp;do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13289" href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/13289-primavera/" rel="">@Primavera</a>, both of them good guys and the latter was also born in Murrica from Romanian parents.
