	Hello, sir. I'm not sure if someone else told you this, but I and a few other people are possibly looking to join silver legion. Communication between all of us has been a bit scrambled, so i apologize if you have already heard this. We used to be members of Atomwaffen, but that went down the shitter due to the recent incident. All of us are in the Boston area. I was wondering, would you like to start up operations there? We are the group that did the Boston university stickering, and we are ready to utilise our services.Â
