<p>Im not talking about the central English oriented library handling the other language material. Im talking about a wider network of autonomous libraries that a specific task force in any country is responsible for. Meaning: If we take Greece for example, you have the English original library, and a greek task force makes a greek version that is autonomous in aspect of running and material management. That way a bigger network and cooperation of give/send material can be achieved, that enhances the capabilities of each archive equally and provide the knowledge and material to an even bigger target base. For example, we can translate classical material and present them in our library in Greek, whereas we can translate the work of Greek authors and Greek material so the English library can be enriched.</p>
<p>In short, the original task force shouldn't bother making the archive multi-lingual in itself, but promoting the exportion of the idea to cells of comrades in other countries so different projects that are inter-related emerge. That would be great as means of providing the chance of anyone to be educated ideologically, as well for anyone who wants to know first hand what he will like or dislike! Plus it will be a major strike on some random white kikes wanting to get rich out of this need!</p>
