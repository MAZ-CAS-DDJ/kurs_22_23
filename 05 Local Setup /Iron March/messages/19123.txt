	Hey, good to hear from you. 
</p>

<p>
	Very unfortunate, maybe when we are more 'legitimate' or whatever we will able to draw in guys like that. No problem though.

	Yeah so if you want stuff that will be useful, get a tarp or a small tent, I got a 10 dollar tent off Amazon and its a pain in the ass to use but it works. Personally I would get a small air mattress, separating your body from the cold ground makes you much warmer at night. Next, get yourself TWO pairs of good, comfortable boots, and when you are in the field, switch them out every day. Get paracord, its cheap and you can use it for so many things. A personal waterfilter like LifeStraw or something similar. Socks - a thin liner and a thick wool sock to go over it, you shouldn't have any room in your boot or else you will get blisters. Sleeping bag like you said of course. Good backpack, idk how much you feel like carrying around, personally I like a compromise between being light and having essentials, this is the one I have so you can see for size comparison

	also I live in a city of 1.3 million, so if things went down <em>right now </em>I wouldn't need to live off the land or go long distances. If I was in the countryside, I would definitely have a larger pack, I'm not sure what you are planning.

	Also if you have or plan on having any firearms, a good load bearing vest is a good idea. Forget any kind of armor.

<p>
	Duct tape, zipties, mess kit, canteen (1L <em>and</em> 2L), a few flint spark lighters 
</p>

<p>
	that's off the top of my head, hope it was helpful
