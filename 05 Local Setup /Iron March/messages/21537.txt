	Hey Florian, thought something like this would be interesting to you.
</p>

	I'm planning on undertaking a pilgrammage to Mount Athos to disconnect from modernity and cleanse my soul. The way it works is you book your stay at a few monastaries and the monks feed and house you but in exchange you help them with their daily monastic labor. Codreanu wrote in For My Legionairies that labour could not only build comraderie but also be a very ennobling experience if done correctly and with a good attitude--I see no place where this can be truer than at Mount Athos.

	I'm looking some brothers in faith that share our worldview and are around the same age as me to join me in this endeavor and travel together with. I think it would be really good for a Fascist Orthodox man to be able to take a few weeks off to escape from this kali yuga and immerse himself in mass and prayer free from usual stressors in a place that has virtually remained unchanged for over a milennia.

	This isn't something I've quite set up yet, right now I'm just gauging for interest around the community and trying to set my small little group up. It would be a project I'd like to undertake sometime within the next five years preferrably before graduating university. Let me know if you're interested.
