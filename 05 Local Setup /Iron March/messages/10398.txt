<p>Will Land in Manchester on the 12th, spend a night there and Liverpool for a couple nights, would like to meet some other mates along the way, if it's no trouble. Will probably end up in London at some time, if perhaps, at white man march, we end up meeting some lads from down there, than we can organise a meet up. I don't know where you are Ben, but would be keen to meet up, if even for a beer. Figured if I bring the flag and two cable ties, than I'd be able to get a length of Dow from a hardware store and be set</p>
<p>But cheers m8, might be easier </p>
