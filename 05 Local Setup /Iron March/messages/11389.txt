<p>I'm probably going to be moving to the Philippines and work in a call center or something. Or do what my dad does: type up deeds. Or start writing, who knows. I'm not really interested in getting a load of dosh, I just want to live.</p>

<p>You're doing college, but did you have a career in mind? If you just did whatever courses interested you rather than what you need to take, you're gonna have rough time. My advice to any young guy who doesn't know what they want, I'd say go to a trade school, pick up a skill for real. I've mentioned welding before; it's a good thing to learn, people always need welders, and it's pretty easy to find an introductory course at a college or something.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm too stupid and lazy for most things, it might not be the best idea to ask me about this sort of stuff. I just don't think about it.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and once I hit eighteen (next year) I'll start getting money from the government 'cause my parents are divorced. Don't know how that works, but that's what I was told. About $1,000 a month.</p>
