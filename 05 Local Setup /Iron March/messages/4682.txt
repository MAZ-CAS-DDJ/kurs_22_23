<p>I am curious why do Russians hate Catholicism so much and why Russians are seemingly apathetic toward Islam, Judaism, and Protestantism. I am more curious about your opinions.</p>
<p>I am a nondenominational Protestant. Personally, I hate Catholicism for a variety of reasons such as their universality and corrupt priesthood. Orthodox Christians are disloyal to Christendom because they have frequently made alliances with Pagans and Muslims against Western Christendom; however, Orthodox Christians are respectable because of their conservatism and fundamentalism. Judaism and Islam are relics that should be destroyed.</p>
