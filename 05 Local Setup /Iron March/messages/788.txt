<p>Hello, WiB. Regarding the thread, it would sound very SF.</p>
<p>Why? The ideal state would develop in a long time and it is heavily linked to the evolution of science and technology.</p>
<p>So, I ask you, do you recommend I make it or not?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>Of course you should make it if you want! Everybody's free to discuss whatever subject he wants, and many of our visions of an ideal state are projections into a distant future. Feel free to open any thread you want if you want to discuss something.</p>
<p>Hails, WiB</p>
