<p>Also I would say that in the last 50 or so years media got cheaper and cheaper. Which means more and more people can talk which means what is being told worth less and less. For example in Hungary all web new portals are being owned by liberals. I guess their papa bought them a job because they couldn't become a banker or proper media person... I think the gawker owned sites and 444.hu is the worst offender. Currently liberals are worshipping immigrants, hating everything value related and thing that gay parade is the apex of  the human achievement. Also their EU / Europe fetish. I have to admit I needed some time to separate the real Europe and the current political idea of Europe.</p>

<p>Back in the day I wanted to make a political blog but I didn't because I realized it is pointless. First of all I am young and lacking a name my voice is worthless. Also the people who would read it are the people who would either support or hate it. Only the big internet sites and old media can win over the big neutral crowds which are the ones that matter. The internet gives us a false illusion of being equal footing on with others. Which means many people will simply stick to intellectual jerking off online without trying to make themselves better.</p>

<p>Conservatives wouldn't be mainstream if they were really against the system...</p>

<p>People can change but the problem is that they don't want to. They would run so far to hear a conforming lie instead of hearing the truth.</p>
