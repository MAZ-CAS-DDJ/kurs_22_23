	The author of SIEGE, James Mason, once did an interview with this carny evangelist personality, Bob Larson, where he just mocks the shit out of him and gives no grounds. It's been muted on youtube completely and we've set out to find and restore the audio, which we did, we have the full thing with both video and audio, but Zeiger said "this already has that VHS look to it. Just needs some retro/nazi/vaporwave music and aesthetics".
</p>

<p>
	So basically we want to create a new version of the interview, that would have all the music and effects, maybe some quiter and relaxing tracks in the background during their conversations and then have our a small break period where you could play around with the visual aesthetics and different music.
