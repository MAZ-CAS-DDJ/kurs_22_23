<p>True, though Mchap has made some comments that have impressed me in the past. On the otherhand, he's Australian, so the specific concerns for his country aren't going to reflect Americas concerns....</p>
<p>When it comes down to agencies, the two that would have the most disproportionate impact would have to be immigration and healthcare. Getting rid of illegal immigrants would reduce unemployment immediately, and getting control on rising healthcare costs is a must for reducing medicare/medicaid, and increasing expendible income.</p>
<p>I thinking getting down to specific agencies might be a better issue once we tackle macro-scale issues. For instance, taxes- I'd suggest swapping production &amp; investment taxes in favor of a Land Value tax, implementing a 35% tariff against nations that rig their trade(such as China and Japan), and Piguvian taxes, such as BTU's, emissions, and "fat" taxes. The immediate effect would raise more reveune than currently, while reducing the cost of American products by an avg. 22-23%(according to fairtaxers), and leveling international trade. Essentially, raising revenues and reversing our trade deficit.</p>
