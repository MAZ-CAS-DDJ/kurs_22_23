	What do you think about an article teaching about starting your own business? Like offering a service and giving examples of services that most likely we have, just being internet efficient, that we can offer small businesses? Because that is what I do. And the incentive for doing so was so that I could be political, get doxxed and not have to worry about my life falling apart.

	I could talk about how to market yourself, how to get clients. I think it's something we should focus on, encouraging being independent. I know it's harder to do it in Europe but in Canada it's quite easy.
