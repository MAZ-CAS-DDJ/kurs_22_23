	Hey, I just read through <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/5660-journey-of-a-nonconformist/" rel="">your topic</a> in the IM Outdoors Club. What happened since then? By the way I have a friend who lived a somewhat similar lifestyle (he lived in a little cottage though) for 1 and a half year, and whom I gave a link to your topic so now he is interested too. What's the situation? Where do you travel?
