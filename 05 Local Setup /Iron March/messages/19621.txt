			Hungarians did change the demographics of the area but it happened slowly and organically without ethnic cleansing given the fact that nobody was thinking in ethnic terms.

			Just think about it, if Hungarians would wanted to assimilate every nation within the Kingdom we could have easily done it over a 1000 years - but we didn't. You can read about a lot of Hungarian noblemen of various ethnic backgrounds, but it was natural that if you were part of the aristocracy you were part of the Hungarian nation regardless of your ancestry.

			You say it was Slavic land before, but there were Celts, Romans, Huns, Germans, Avars there, all of them before the Slavs who by the way came here <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/The_Donets_Basin_is_the_heart_of_Russia.jpg" rel="external nofollow">from the East</a> just like Hungarians. Even when Hungarians conquered Pressburg it wasn't defended by Slavs but Germans.

	Nope. We only learned about that quote which says something like: 1000 years old mariage with Hungary went wrong, we must dissolve.

	It is selective as fuck, who can be behind this?<img alt=":feld:" data-emoticon="" src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/feld.png" title=":feld:" /></p>

	Edit: My opinion: I like idea of stronger roots with Hungary. In economic union or military aliance most. Although i wouldn't like being in common state with your people. But don't worry, i don't even want to live in same state with Czechs (after Moravians our closest brothers in language similiarities)
