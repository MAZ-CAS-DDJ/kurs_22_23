<p>"Anyways, any thoughts on your country's monarchy? Should it be created once more? Or you are saying no to a monarchy?"</p>
<p>Hmm totalitarism is just like the monarchy but without succession wich make it better in some way it depends of the "Leader" though but i more like it.. Stratocracy will do the trick too...</p>
