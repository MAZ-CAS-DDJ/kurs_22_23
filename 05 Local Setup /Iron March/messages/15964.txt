			Skype is safe enough. There are of course government people watching, but they can't prosecute us for anything. Atomwaffen has a rule that if you do anything that isn't safe, don't speak about it. <br /><br />
			Simply putting up stickers in your town will help with recruiting, if you feel alone in chapter that is fine. We have a couple people that are lone chapters, and some that were.

	Ok I'm setting up skype but I don't get cell reception where I live (I'm very rural) and it's supposed to send me a code, so when I go to town I'll finish setting it up and give you my info. Stickers and flyers were my plan I work in town with a larger population. I'm thinking that's my best bet. I'm off work today and tomorrow so I'll have plenty of time to be in contact with you.
