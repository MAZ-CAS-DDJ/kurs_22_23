	Hello WeisseWolfe,
</p>

<p>
	        Id like to just introduce myself before I go any further. My name is Jared, I'm 16, and I am in the Boston area. Specifically, Reading. I heard of the poster strike at Boston University, and I must say it was glorious news to hear about. I was almost jumping for joy when I heard it, but I was in public so I kept my excitement contained. You put those kikes on edge, lets keep them that way. Now, One of your members in the area contacted me a while ago and asked if I wanted to join Atomwaffen. I said I did, but she disappeared on the site I was using. I'm assuming she gave you my Skype, but I just need to make sure if you got it. Also, is she ok or is she occupied trying to avoid the investigators? I am very excited to be in the Ironmarch community, and I look forward to working with the members as much as I can. My thanks go out to the staff that have allowed me to be a part of this fraternity. I should be available for a screening by the summer at the latest, but it will probably be much sooner so ill keep you updated. But remember, goyim, never forget the lampshades and soap, as well as the 6 gurbillion! :D. Together, this fraternity will organize and agitate to achieve any goal we wish. Stay safe, man. - Arundel (Jared C)
