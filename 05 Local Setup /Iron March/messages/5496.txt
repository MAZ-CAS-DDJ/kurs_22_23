<p>Hahaha, I am actually American. I live in America; my parents are both Romanian. </p>
<p>There are actually a large number of Muslims in the South Eastern part of the country. My family came from a small village that was centered around a Tekke (a sufi lodge), and from what I have read and seen, the Bektashi community seems to be doing quite well for itself there. I know for a fact that my family has been in the Bektashi community going back at least as far as my great great grandfather, which means they were probably orthodox Shia Muslims or Orthodox Christians before that (the Bektashi accepts both).</p>
