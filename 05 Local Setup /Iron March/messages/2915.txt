<p>Hello, I have read your description and it lead me to an idea.</p>
<p>For sometime prior to becoming a member of this site I had been reading several posts from some of the more active members and it has become apparent that the main reason that an active fascist party with a new perspective from the youth such as we is that we tend to lack a key trait, Ambition.</p>
<p>Oh yes we can sit in our classrooms and daydream of enlightening those around us and rallying them behind a fascist cause, but in truth we lack the ambition to take the first step into politics, we lack the discipline to carry out our ideals and see them through.</p>
<p>This leads me to my proposal.</p>
<p>You and I are both Americans so I don't think I need to explain the situation in this country or the evident and inevitable collapse coming.</p>
<p>I propose that You and I work together to create a order dedicated to establishing a new Fascist Nation. I have no fear of a Future in which I fight for a better nation.</p>
<p>It is a simple proposal.</p>
<p>You say that you are ambitious, I am as well. so much so that i am no longer afraid of standing and taking punches for my beliefs.</p>
<p>I will close by saying this.</p>
<p>We all wait for the opportunity to make a difference and it is the moment when that opportunity presents itself that a decision is to be made, do we seize that moment with no doubts, no regrets, and stride headlong into the future and forge our fate? or do we let opportunity pass, assuring ourselves that it is not the right moment, or that to much is at stake to take that chance? or perhaps that it is simply not worth the effort.</p>
<p>The Chance is here, if you are willing to take it.</p>
