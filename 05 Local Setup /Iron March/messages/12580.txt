<p>Hey, I am doing well, go to hear you are too. I am still thinking about ordering the comic or I guess the proper term would (jap) manga version of Legends of the Galactic Heroes from Barnes and Noble. I mean I am not a web but I do like LOTGH and it is not degenerate, so I may just check out the comic. Your thoughts? Still wish there was more fiction from an imperial/empire view because I think people can be taught <em>some </em>important values and virtues from fiction. Kind of like your idea about making a game with Fascist themes, btw let me know if you ever do that. So, how is university going for you? Maybe, you can watch more episodes over break. Me, I have midterms next followed by a week long break, which I will probably spend working. Anyways, sorry to ramble on. It was great to hear from you again. Let me know if you get this m8.</p>
