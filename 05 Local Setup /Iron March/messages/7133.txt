<p>After that Wolves of Vinland article by Jack Donovan the group is seeing crazy interest, funny how that can happen. We're keen to meet with as many people as possible this year, going to Sweden in the next few weeks to meet some old NS folks out in the woods. There's definitely a movement and energy this last year that hasn't been present before.</p>
