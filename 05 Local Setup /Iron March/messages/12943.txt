	Right let's focus on the expose. 
</p>

<p>
	What we'll need in the story part of the article is some background on the Lithuanian nationalist scene, some background history and minimal information on existing movements or groups and why they actually amount to anything good.
</p>

<p>
	After that it should move on to the history of Skydas, namely who started it, what was the basis for its creation or inspiration, some personal background on the founding members, how they came to be fascists.
</p>

<p>
	Then we can move on to the interview part, which would actually depend on how much info you put up in the story part but I'll send some basic questions right now and we can see later if we can just incorporate them into the story or keep separate and then maybe develop them further and come up with follow up questions.
</p>

<ol><li>
		Did you start out creating Skydas already knowing what you want this group to be or did it experience some changes as it developed?
	</li>
	<li>
		What are the founding principles of Skydas and what is your overall plan of action in Lithuania?
	</li>
	<li>
		What kind of activism do you do? 
	</li>
	<li>
		You've taken up a very particular style, could you tell us about its role?
	</li>
	<li>
		Does Skydas appear to be something novel on the Lithuanian nationalist scene? What was the reaction of the public so far to your appearance? What about the other nationalist groups and the police/government?
	</li>
	<li>
		How big is Skydas at the moment? (no need for specific numbers just an estimate) Do you have multiple chapters across Lithuania or are you localized?
	</li>
	<li>
		Benjamin Raymond of National Action has actually met up with your group, how did that go?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is the relationship between <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> and Skydas?
	</li>
	<li>
		What kind of news can we expect Skydas to become associated with once you break the media barrier?
	</li>
	<li>
		Many people find it hard to actually start up an actual group and get going. Is there anything you'd like to say to our readers and fascists worldwide that could prove useful?
	</li>
