			For example in Košice lived mainly Slovak population (Hungarians were big minority (around 20-30% as far as i remember) bit Slovaks were still majority). Or Šaňo Machs birth village Slovenský meder was taken too by Horthy. The problem was that your people haven't taken only Hungarian majority areas.

	Yeah but if you look up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Bratislava" rel="external nofollow">demographic changes of Bratislava</a> f.ex. you can see how Czechoslovakia turned a mostly German and Hungarian city into a Slovakian one in just a few years, even if before it was one of our most important cities in which a lot of our kings were crowned in the past. Nitra would have been a more Slovakian capital imho, even a more historical one because of its name. Also the ethnic maps of Czechoslovakia clearly shows that they didn't really give a shit about Germans and Hungarians when they created it.

	There are tons of literature about them, I will ask the Romanians from here what would they recommend for you. One of the IM headers sums up what I wanted to tell about them though:

	They had a strong death cult and I see this as something similar to what you told me about Hlinka. I collected some texts on the connection between death cults and Fascism, you can check it out <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/7541-cultural-cuisine-exchange-thread-formerly-secondestate-spergout-playpen-hijacked-by-youthknives/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=182246" rel="">here</a>.

	Good, that's how I do these things usually. Also make an imgur profile for your pictures so that you won't lose them later.

<p>
	Make a topic on the life in the Slovakian state for a start in which you can write about all these things you mentioned here and also the cult of Hlinka and post it in ex-Chechoslovakia, then you can make another topic which focuses on the person of Hlinka, his views on politics, religion with some quotes from him and post it in the Famous persons category.
</p>

<p>
	If you want I can check your writing before you post it (don't worry I won't do Hungarian pranks :D).
