<p>Canadian Sniper training depends at what level you operate on. There are two levels to simplify it, general snipers who are assigned to regular regiments and JTF2 and CSOR snipers who are things made of nightmares. </p>
<p> </p>
<div>The training pipeline to get into the Sniper School itself is extremely arduous and only the best and mentally and physically fit make the cut, even then the drop out rate is 90%+ </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>Basically, once you've finished Basic Training and your Soldier's Qualification, you'll have to complete your QL3's for Infantry and then just do your time and get some courses under your belt, as well as meet a minimum standard of marksmanship to be even considered for sniper training. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>From what I gathered speaking to snipers and other infantry types, they're looking for people who are extremely fit, have good leadership skills, initiative, patience, memory and analytical skills, above and beyond the marksmanship skills and the instincts for fieldcraft that are required to pass the training. And that's only for the snipers attached to the regular infantry battalions. </div>

<p>Now JTF2 and CSOR are much different, you are selected. In the CAF these two groups are rarely spoken about in the CAF because it is considered taboo, many people in the CAF do not even know what missions they have been a part of other than Operation KBAR. The prime minister or any government official has no jurisdiction over them and are not told of their operations, some soldiers will not even talk about them over forums. Their training is not really known. I have heard rumors that one of the things they do is they leave them in a dark room for two weeks and rarely give them food and water, they blast loud sounds when they suspect they are sleeping and mid way through the week a person enters the room and tells them they can leave and will be charged with treason if they speak about what they have done, they are also on experimental PEDs. Soldiers are even suspicious of some of the videos the government have used as recruitment campaigns as the soldiers have never seen them in real life, even US commanders have selected JTF2 over SEALS in Afghanistan. Only 400 of them.</p>
