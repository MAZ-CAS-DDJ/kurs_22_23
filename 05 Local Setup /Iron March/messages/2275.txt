<p>While, I approve of the DPRK's nationalism and militarism, I don't feel they're on the correct path to socialism. Their regime has a very exclusive party membership (like China) and their people are kept dirt poor by the lack of proper involvement in the national system aswell as the lack of profit motive.</p>
