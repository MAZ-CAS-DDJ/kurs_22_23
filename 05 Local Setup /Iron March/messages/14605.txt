	I think it's pretty safe to say that Trump won't be living much longer, I'm sure he'll die in a totally normal plane crash or something of the sort. After such events take place, do you think that's when killing political or cultural icons will take place? I'd think so, unless they totally buy into the MSM story of whatever happens to them. I also think that it would be easier to polarize sectors of the public after such an event. Any thoughts?
