<p>Hey Akhnaton,<br /><br />This is Blackshirt 13 here. I just wanted to ask some questions real quick. I don't know if you saw my post the other day about have I have to wait until March (because my hair needs to grow) to get a better version of the Hitlerjugend haircut. I was thinking I would go with this version. Although obviously, without the earring because I am not a fag. Keep in mind that I have glasses and both brown hair and eyes. Anyways, what do you think?</p>

<p>People will probably ask for me to post a pic, so since you know how to get that to work (last time I couldn't post the picture but had to put up a link instead) would you mind if I sent the pic to you in a link and <strong><em>you</em></strong> would go ahead and post it unaltered. I mean I honest can't figure out how to get past the error message (nor do I have the time to figure it out) and it would just be easier for someone to post it for me. Although, to be honest after the flack I got from the last pic I probably won't post another one. But, I was just curious that if I did would you be willing to do this favor for me? Anyways, I also wanted to ask if you made any progress on LOTGH and KOTOR 1 and 2? Sorry for the long PM. Please let me know if you get this.</p>
