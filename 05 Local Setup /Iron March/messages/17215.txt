	I studied it when I was younger, and most of the 'advice' I gave was not wrong. But then I read a book (I can't remember the name) about these things, it debunked pretty heavily - you can say that "in your workplace, something's gonna go wrong, but you should stick with yourself" or something like that and it will come true! ... because it's human nature and basic knowledge of life stuff.

	Nowadays I don't believe. But you can, heh, call me an Agnostic-Pagan if you want, as I see the 'real' paganism (not the LARP and wicca shit, but the connection with nature) as the only 'true' spirituality. Also, the term in itself is 'problematic'.
