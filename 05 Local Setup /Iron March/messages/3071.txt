<p>The Moscow Patriarchate definitely consists of treacherous pigs and liars. It is quite common for Moscow-priests to spill ukrainophobe crap, e.g. that Russia should occupy Crimea or that Ukrainians are just "Little Russians". All they deserve is a bullet to the head. I agree on your observation that Orthodox people are chauvinist all too often, the Russians but also the Serbs being the most obvious examples.</p>
