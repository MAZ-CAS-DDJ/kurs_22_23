<p>Ok, so I assume you're going to be resitting this year?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What universities are there in that area? Nottingham, is good. But I'm unaware of what other places that offer degree study.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We currently don't have anyone from Lincoln, so someone going around agitating around there should be a boon to us. Ideologically we intend on being hardline and uncompromising when it comes to our propaganda - it is all out attack.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What we can do is send leaflets to you via courier, it is quite expensive, but if you are going to distribute them, it is worth the cost. What are you limits when it comes to activism? Are you able to travel or are restricted geographically? Do only do things as part of a group or can you do things alone? Staying legal is obviously important. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>No, actually I'm taking a University course at the College rather than resitting my A-Levels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As far as any activity I could engage in, it would all be solitary. I don't have any sympathetic friends and Keith Thompson has informed me that the closest group I could find would be an hour's train ride away. Not that I'm fazed by that; I'd just need you to keep it in mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'd distribute anything you gave me and I could, say, make monthly trips to Nottingham if you don't already have someone up there. I don't have access to a car, though, so other than it would be restricted to Lincoln and North Hykeham.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What do you mean when you say limits? I, pretty much, up for anything as long as it's legal.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ah right, fair enough.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the moment, what I'm finding is that we have a number of people in different places but without any concentrations of people. So we are focusing on forms of activism that require less manpower but have a high yield of interest. An example: at Warwick there might be a protest next term against the selling of sweatshop made goods in the Uni, I'm thinking that me and two other comrades turning up with banners, black flag, dressing in the black bloc style, with our message being the emancipation of the people of the world from the globalised capitalist system, it could press some buttons. Some clever person does some research on us, finds out we are Nazis and ends up doing a write up on us in some student paper = result. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other things like leafleting are good in themselves, but hand something to some busybody and you'll find something written in the paper or a blog about the group - alles gut. Likewise with stickers or posters. Something more ambitious however would be an idea that Ben has had, to hit libraries with business cards and A6 leaflets. Just stuff them into the books. If people keep finding them and complaining about them, eventually the library might be forced to close for a day or two so that it can be 'cleansed'. So if you can think of anything like that - give us an idea of what you need, we shall provide it and go and do it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are artistic at all and there are some walls nearby with lots of graffiti scrawling, why not take a can and do something like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1n4b3MbLIo" rel="external nofollow">this</a>? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Really though, what will work is if you can find a local issue that everyone in your area cares about but is neglected by the establishment and run with it. If not fine, but don't expect any breakthroughs or inquiry's anytime soon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thinking a bit further afield. We will be trying to attend London Forum meetings in force over the next few months to man stalls and raise our profile among what is the best of our movement - even if they aren't much themselves. Also, if numbers allow we will be aiming for a spontaneous demonstration at some point. We will also be mobilising contingents to any demonstrations we see to be pushing for something we agree with - there is an annual march in Boston against immigration, EDL demonstrations possibly, large anti-austerity/cuts protests and if events unfold in a certain fashion, against the war in Syria.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our first real world actions we are beginning in late September/early October, and currently in several places: Birmingham, Warwickshire, Surrey, Essex, London, and with you in Lincolnshire. After a month of establishing ourselves as a credible group that is active on the streets, we will be holding our first meeting. I'm in contact with Jez Turner who should be able to line us up one or two good speakers. It will be in Central London and in early November. I want a good attendance. If all goes to plan and it doesn't get rumbled, we should find ourselves in a good position to continue until Christmas. Then we can rest for a bit, recharge and decide our next move. </p>
