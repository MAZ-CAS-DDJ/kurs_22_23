<p>I don't have much of an opinion on him. I can't judge whether or not his authority as a religious leader was valid, since I don't know much about Islam from an Muslim perspective. Though I am doubtful that it was valid, because he most certainly had power. As far as I understand Tradition (Tradition defined as the root of all valid religious forms), religious authority can only entail minimal political power, and Khomeini obviously had a great deal of that. So that indicates to me that he may not have been practicing and heading up a valid form of Islam.</p>
<p> I sympathize with Theocracy in principle, but I don't know enough about modern Theocracies to pass judgment, I'm likely to oppose them according to where they fit in Geopolitically. I have a degree of respect for Islam, because it certainly has esoteric content when it comes to the Sufis. I oppose Islam when it comes to Europe, and I get the feeling that Khomeini as well as modern day Iranians intend to promote Islam anywhere and everywhere.</p>
<p>If I were to put it simply; Khomeini may have been good for Islam and Iran, but I can't see him being good for Europe or Europeans.</p>
<p> I have to say, I find your question strange. Is there a sizable amount of Muslims in the Philippines?</p>
