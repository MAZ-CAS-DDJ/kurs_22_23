	Mass conversion and assimilation of catholic Serbs into Croats is a hostile act of Vatican towards us. They were begging the King and Serbian officials to merge their lands into Serbia so that they don't get divided by Italians or Austrians, we made them equals to us even tho Croats en mass fought against the Serbs in Austrian army. April War came and all of them deserted and took part in biological destruction of Serbian people. No one has done this to us expect Albanians and Croats. We have this joke about Bulgarians being back stabbers because of WW1, but real back stabbers are Croats. The future of Croats is either they will accept their Serbian and slavic roots and assimilate and their lands divided or face genocide.Â <br />
	Balkan peninsula belongs only to 3 nations, Serbs, Greeks and Bulgarians, artificial constructs of nations must be dealt as if it were cancer.
