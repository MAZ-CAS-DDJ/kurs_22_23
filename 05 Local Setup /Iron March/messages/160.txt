<p>Good on Occidental House bit, I have some links to share that you may like. Qho is Fasces again? Why a National Socialist slant? And I have a question, if you abandon "Union!" I'm seriously considering taking it for myself to replace reakation!</p>
<p>Tell me about your religious projects. </p>
<p>Regards to whatever it is your mother is going through. </p>
<p>I haven't officially converted to the Orthodoxy, I'm going to wait awhile before starting catechumem. I've taken a liking to the Romanian OC, although the only difference in the nationalities behind the churches are just that, nationalities. Same message, different flavor. </p>
<p>God bless Codreanu for inspiring me!</p>
