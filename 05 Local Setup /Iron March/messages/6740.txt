<p>It's interesting that you mention the Christian faith, because from my understand many of the leaders within the Reich were moving away from Christian ideology towards a more pagan belief system wrapped up in Aryanism. In this case, men using women for pleasure would not be something shameful, but just part of the natural order. These women were serving their men, state, and race. I think they are heroes in their own right.</p>
