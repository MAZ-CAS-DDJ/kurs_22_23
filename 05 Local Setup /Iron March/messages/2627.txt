<p>I have heard about Danskernes Parti before, read about them on realisten.se i think. I am convinced that a true ethnic nationalism is the only thing that will save us from the genocidal policies of today. The cultural nationalism of SD and DF will merely lead to a slower death of our peoples than the policies of globalist parties.</p>
<p>What i like about SMR is that they, so to speak, but a boot in the face of politicians. They stand up for their beliefs and are not afraid of being radical. But what i donÂ´t like is that they are very sectarian, and very suspicious of people who don't exactly think in the same way as them.</p>
