<p>Thankyou for posting the reminder about the charter- ie. that this is not a WN hangout. </p>
<p>I've been a little concerned lately to see the large number of Nazi/NS members joining Iron March. One of the initial reasons I joined this forum was because it was a place I could discuss 'far-right' politics and ideology without having to listen to boneheads drone on about 'niggers'. </p>
<p>It seems that lately almost every other thread lately is either about Nazism or dominated by Nazis. This is unpleasant. I think you know me well enough to know I'm not a delicate type, or in favour of PC language, but the amount of derogatory racism being thrown about lately is also concerning- it turns the forum into a primitive sewer. It's good to see the staff are on top of this trend, or at least aware about it. </p>
<p>Thanks again, and sorry for the long message, but this has been on my mind a bit.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>-PSG</p>
