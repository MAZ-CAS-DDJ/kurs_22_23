<p>Hi there. I know you put up quite a struggle against the Soviets as well.</p>
<p>Well, radicalism isn't very popular here, as Finland is economically and socially still very stable, and so I too am undecided at the moment. Politically, I'm anti-EU, anti-globalist, anti-multiculturalist and anti-immigration. And that's the view of our nationalist party as well so I'm quite content with them, for now.</p>
