	We'll get there, buddy! No worries. I'm 100% determined to not stop until I reach the final final Truth.

	I haven't seen that Slavros calculation yet. Do you know how he came up with it? Because it looks like he's referring to one of the mini-Kali-Yuga cycles rather than the ultimate Kali Yuga cycle (which I believe will end in about 400,000 years, bringing about the literal end of the universe). I don't think Slavros is referring to the Apocalypse there.

	About AW, that sounds wonderful. Feel free to tell them that I'm living in the East Coast at the moment. And about Baranyi—I appreciate the effort, but I don't think that question will receive any fruitful answers. I know Kurdish politics up and down, and it's mostly just capitalists and Marxists and Islamists. There's not much else aside from a few youth groups. (There are some interesting Sufi orders though, in case that's what you're wondering about.)

	Hmm, are you sure about the alt-right thing? You mean the Spencer and Anglin crowd? Doesn't look serious enough to me. I mean, come on, Pepemancy? Lol, that's comically ridiculous. It's like if Hitler began his NSDAP rallies <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6V6c0e7-3c&amp;t=12s" rel="external nofollow">like this.</a>

	And yeah, I don't like beaches or lakes either. Too bourgeois for my tastes. I prefer mountains and forests. The more secluded, the better.
