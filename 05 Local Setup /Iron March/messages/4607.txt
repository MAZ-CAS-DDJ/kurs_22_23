<p>If you are making an offer to contribute materials I support that 100% it is what we are all about. I have not updated the archive in some time as we have put money into raising a second archive which will be super modern and internationa. See the operation igloo topic. but it depends.</p>
<p>However if you want to share something then see the "community archive project" section of the forum and under external materials is where we have been posting some of our findings (though you will find most of it around the forum). besides this even secondary sources on Quisling are thin on the ground. We have not had a norwedian speaker on the forum for some time, and we cannot traslate any work, or know if it to speak of.</p>
<p>A while ago We shared a large set of Hi res occupation/samling posters.</p>
