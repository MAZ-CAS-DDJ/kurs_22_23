<p>I think I mentioned the earlier on in this conversation. They mostly turned into something similar to the Conservative Party in Britain: Somewhat Christian and Conservative and very Liberal when it comes to the economy. I don't particularly like them to be very honest with you. Their plans for the economy can mostly be boiled down to "SELL EVERYTHING AND THEN CLAIM WE ARE IMPROVING THE COUNTRY". I still firmly believe that they deliberately mismanaged public industries so they would be able to sell them off when they began to fail. I think their leadership is overly weak and totally unwilling to make any hard but necessary decisions (Such as on immigration, our outdated and flawed education system, overpopulation, inefficient bureaucracy etc)  which may cost them votes, so they just bend over and let private companies (very often foreign) and organisations do what the hell they want. They also brought us into the E.U. and got rid of our old (Hard as rock) currency.</p>
<p>They have some good aspects, of course. They are really and truly the only organised movement which opposes going liberal on many social issues (Divorce, Gay marriage, abortion etc) but I have a feeling that will end once the next generation replaces the current one. I also trust them more than the other party (which isn't such a great achievement, but anyway) and do believe that they have some decent members. </p>
<p>What are the parties like in Australia btw?</p>
