<p>Yeah, I haven’t understood the reason for the flak you’ve got on IM. They pride themselves on giving people a hard time, but can be quite arbitrary in who they give that hard time to.</p>

<p>I’m going to have a go at running a regular email through PGP. No point in pissing about with less than 100% alternatives like Safemail, if I can figure this out instead. Though I think I’ll use GPG instead. How does it stack up against PGP? Is it pretty much the same?</p>

<p>Also, in case I can’t get my head around the above, how long do you reckon it takes to get a Protonmail account, now there’s a waiting list?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And yeah, I’ll definitely be staying in touch. I like the way your mind works. I particularly liked one phrase you used in your talk; something along the lines of you wanting to help us ‘build an impenetrable wall of darkness.’ I’ll send you an email anyway mate (probably from Safemail.)</p>
