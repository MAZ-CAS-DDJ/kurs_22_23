	Other than the <a href="http://www.nsm88.org/" rel="external nofollow">NSM</a>, I don't think so, the NSM is the largest, and the majority of them are skinheads, but they are the Â largest and most organized at least to my knowledge. If you're looking for like an National Action sort of movement, I don't think America has one, but you can join groups like the NSM or something of the sort and start to reform it from the inside. Not sure if that was the answer you were looking for, but I hope that helps.
