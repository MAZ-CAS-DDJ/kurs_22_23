<p>Cute cute cute. Is that you? Wait, I thought you were a teacher. Where did you steal that baby from?? Babies are a more serious crime than vacuums, Ida.</p>
<p>Babysit too, or something?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And is that a baby telnyashka? <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>Yes cold is the best, and I love rain too, and sheepskins sound awesome. I'd say I would like to join you but then I'd sound like a real creeper. I'm sitting under the aircon pretending i'm somewhere cooler.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also what... thing do you keep sending me? After "The cold is best", it's coming out as a box with numbers in it, so I dunno what it is.</p>
