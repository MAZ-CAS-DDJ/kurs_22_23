<p>Blackshirt 13,</p>
<p>First, I apologize for the time; I was moving out of my dorm and back home for the summer and I've been immensly busy. On top of that, my email seems to be acting up and not notifying me and so I assumed you didn't write back. </p>
<p>Second, I checked my messages today and it seems that there are three different conversations between you and I going on and I'm unsure which one I am to reply to. Namely, they all seem pretty similar and so I am unsure which one you want to grow the conversation out of. </p>
<p>In that respect, can you resend the message you want me to reply to in this PM thread and we can continue from there? </p>
<p>_V</p>
<p>ps. you don't need to formally address me or anything, you can just chat. </p>
