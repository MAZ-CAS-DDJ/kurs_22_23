<p>Do these forums really have that much of an issue with queers and lesbians? I only advocate such things because I recognized my own peculiarities and realized that it's all good as long as it doesn't get taken too far (like "pride" parades). People should not flaunt sexuality. Anyway nice to meet you.</p>
