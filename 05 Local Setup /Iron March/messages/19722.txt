	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	 am not an American, I am French and I live in France.
</p>

<p>
	I saw your publication about your organization. I find that your organization looks very beautiful.
</p>

<p>
	What I particularly like is the militant ethnic nationalists like you who do not lack daring.
</p>

<p>
	I myself am a nationalist militant who is ready to do anything to defend his country, his faith and his race. We already have that in common. My country, France is invaded (33% of Arab and black Muslims).
</p>

<p>
	I'm not going to procrastinate, I'm here to find material. At home, it is very hard to find efficient equipment and prices (for bad equipment) are more than exaggerated, so international alliances are obligatory for us, even if informal.
</p>

<p>
	I think we both have a lot to bring if you agree to continue our conversation.
</p>

<p>
	See you soon American comrade !
</p>
