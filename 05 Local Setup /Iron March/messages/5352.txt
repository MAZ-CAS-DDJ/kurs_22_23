Eventually this led them to support corporatism and fascism.  </p>

<p>Yes I know Ritz and his initiative Zwart Front, although he still has a long way to go. The movement in our country has completely collapsed in recent years, so its not easy to build a new movement, especially not if you build it from scratch. We also invided Ritz as a speaker on a meeting of the National-Syndicalist Platform.  </p>
