<p>Greetings, Mr. von Eisen</p>
<p>Thanks for the greetings and kind words. At this point, I still feel I'm very much getting my feet wet in the forum: I certainly have a lot more reading to do, and so don't feel equipped to align myself with any person or group at this point. Indeed, that day may never come, but that's entirely down to my 'lone wolf' personal philosophy, and should not be taken as any slight on you and your colleagues' opinions. [Though I must confess to some curiosity as to which of my views attracted your interest!]</p>
<p>Best wishes regardless, and I'll definitely keep an eye out for your posts on the forum.</p>
<p> Max.</p>
