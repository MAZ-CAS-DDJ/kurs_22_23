<p>That sounds great, unity is what we need the most - especially in rather bleak times like this. Regarding the Russians, my attitude towards them is not nearly as bad as one could assume reading my posts here, I just like to see Vladimir Borisov and Slavros go mad since they are pretentious fags. I view the Russian state with suspicion and I don't like how many of the Russians in Ukraine behave and act like a fifth column as well as their chauvinists (naturally), but that's about it. Normal Russians don't bother me and I think Ukraine and Russia should have normal relations based on mutual respect (same goes for all our neighbours). Anyway, I didn't know there were Russian Catholics. I always thought the Catholics in Russia were actually descendants of deported Ukrainians, Poles, Lithuanians and Germans.</p>
