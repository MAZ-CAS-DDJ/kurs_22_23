	Well actually I've been recruiting Polish diaspora in the states. I have a friend who served in the National Guard here and wants to set up the Paramilitary group with me, as well as a few friends from Poland who are going into Straz Graniczna who are interested as well. And Falanga is Catholic? I have been reading Xportal for while. I think the site is very interesting but I disagree with Bartosz supporting Hezbollah and LWP. I talked to a few members on IronMarch like Bombenhagel but we didn't really get far in discussion. He basically said setting up a paramilitary group is difficult but can be done, (since Falanga has done it). I also noticed that under your ideology you have "Clerical Fascism" just like I do - so I can probably assume that you are a Traditionalist Catholic like I am, because the Vatican II is a Jewish facade.
