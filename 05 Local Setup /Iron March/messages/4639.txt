<p>My beliefs? That's a tough questions. My beliefs change day by day, but if I had to say what I stay consistent with, it have to be my firm loyalty to the right wing. I used to be a starch conservative but I felt that it wasn't cutting it enough for me to answer the really deep intellectual questions. I would hear professors always spout their leftist bullshit and I would think to myself "Well fuck, I can only attack this from a conservative angle." At one point I found myself losing grip of my Conservative values which then made me look up harder right wing ideology. That's when I realized that fascism was neat, and had a vast array of intellectual tools that really knew how to drive home at critiquing Marxism and liberalism.</p>
<p>I don't know if I would call my self a full on fascist as there are a lot of things that are wrong with that system of government. But it did lead me to understand the Right more in depth.</p>
<p>How about you, what is it about Henry Clay you admire and what principles of America do you like?</p>
