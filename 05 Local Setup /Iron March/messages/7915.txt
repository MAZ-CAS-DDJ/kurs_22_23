<p>How did it come that you were introduced to Turanism? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for Turanism in Finland, yes, I can understand why. Finland has been under Swedish control for so long, and even now, the Swedes exercise control through linguistic dominance, forcing Finns to learn a non-standard form of Swedish that will not benefit them at all.</p>
<p>And given that Turkic and Finnic people have had a shared history in places such as the İdel-Ural area, I can positively state that Turan does hold a place for the Finnic people at heart, more so than what they can find in the EU, or amongst Russians.</p>
<p>But of course, it is up to the Finnish people to decide with whom they wish to associate with or not at all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of the Finns here are very opposed to the very idea, while some have a mild sympathy towards it, as you can see from this thread:</p>

<p>Well, I was always interesting about Ural-Altaic connections but first I did not know correct term. Later net told me more. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>Well, many people consider Matthias Alexander Castren one of the pioneers of Turanism, so Finland has history of it.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is up to Finnish people to decide but as you have maybe noticed, there are many type of Finnish Nationalists and different ideologies. Some feels solidarity towards Sweden and West, some are openly hostile towards Sweden. Same with Russia etc. Some cares just about Islam (Though even they leave Tatars alone. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> ), some condemns almost allkind of immigration etc, etc. So, same with Turanism, I would say.</p>
<p>I saw Ukko Finno-Bear's pics and posts about Turanism and I have seen those many times in net before so no surprise. </p>
