<p>Making money from your hobby is probably the nicest thing that may ever happen to someone but as you might know it is extremely hard. Authors and writters in Bulgaria are not swimming in gold due to the fact people struggle financially and buy books rarely. Although I grew up in a semi-working class family my mother (teacher) managed to teach me the value of books, reading and I am extremely thankful for that. Thus, my own book collection is growing and even my grandmother is joking what are we doing with all those books <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>I agree on the more traditional life here. Yes, we are a capitalistic state  now and a lot of people try to mimic the western crazy way of living but overall people are more racially aware, conservative etc. They are heavily trying to influence the youth in creating a degenerate mass of whores and stupid pseudo alpha males like everywhere and this is concerning. Youth is being bombarded with drugs, degenerate music (rap and chalga music), pseudoideals (silicone prostitues for women and steroid halfapes for men) and criminal's mentality but I think those things fade after high school. </p>

<p>We still have much to change in our lifestyle but at least you won't see idiot leftists (there are some antifas but their activity is mostly on the web and almost nothing in real life), openly praising homosexuality, refugees/gypsies etc. It is funny how socialism kept our conservative way of thinking unlike the ultraliberal West. I will probably have hard time blending in the Western world with all that political correct crap and all the witch hunting and thought crimes that we, the white people are being accused. I'd rather live here and be myself than being a silent pawn in Germany, for example for money. Not worth it, imo.</p>
