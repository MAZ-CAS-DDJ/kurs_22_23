They try and insert modern values into ancient religions that would have despised them and sacrificed them to bog goddesses, it feels like some grand insult by the Jews to defile ancient Aryan teachings. I have noticed every Wiccan I met was a former Jew</p>

<p>Yes, <strong>organization is key</strong> is the lesson to take from Gaul. They had superior armor, weapons, roads, gold, strength and numbers but it took Vercingetorix far too long too organize the tribes into an army. By the time he did it was too late. Rome however worked like a well-oiled machine and they adapted to any situation and copied the tactics and technology of their enemies. </p>

<p>Those statues from Gaul depict ancestors and have niches for skulls, possibly the skulls of the ancestors depicted. Their workmanship in statues  was almost as skilled as the Romans while surpassing them in creativity. </p>
