	We rarely delete threads, no we just close them after a week to prevent useless prolonged discussions inside the intro threads which should be happening elsewhere on the forum.

	And deleting an intro altogether is kind of meh, I can change the OP to anything you want though. Also was the other thread you redacted your jew-watch thing? We do have subforums which are hidden from non-registered users that we could move it to and you can keep the discussion going, but obviously once someone registers they'd have access to it, so alternatively you could start a new thread and phrase it differently.

	Just as a sort of explanation, I suppose, our unspoken consensus on these sort of things is not to say anything online you're not willing to repeat in real life because anything can be brought up with a waybackmachine anyway or screenshots and so on. Deleting or removing stuff just makes it more suspect. Frankly I don't think you really have anything to worry about though.
