<p>Saw your post on the "shitty conversations" thread. Want to comment something here.</p>
<p>Did you by any chance join for the purpose of serious discussion of fascism and it's application and "re-birth" in the modern day, to find a site that appears to be 4chan-esque in behavior?</p>
<p>I'd make a post on the thread but I'm just an "autistic roleplaying fetishist with only 6-7 posts"(the most likely answer to my displeasure and concern).</p>
<p>I just wanted to get your opinion here, because I'm starting to question whether I came to a site for mature discussions of the fascist ideology or just some close-knit community of circle-jerking misfits.</p>
