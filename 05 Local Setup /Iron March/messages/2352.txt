<p>Sounds good. But do have a backup plan, those conservatives might quickly reject at you for asking to donate for a nationalist enclave, but persuade them as best as you can, and tell them this is good for their country. I also suggest using your group's collective fund, and using your own money, but use it for emergencies only. I also suggest in buying small plots, your enemies might notice that you are buying land, and might then claim your purchasing against you.</p>
