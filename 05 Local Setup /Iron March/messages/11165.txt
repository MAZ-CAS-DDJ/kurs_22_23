<p>Yeah, nofap is basically no porn or masturbation of any kind. But some take it further and include no actual sex. It depends on what your goals are. People who have hardcore porn addiction and suffer from erectile dysfunction because of it sometimes need to spend some weeks or months without any sexual stimulation of any kind (including sex with their wives and GF) in order to become "normal" again. I'm not in that situation, I just do it for improved concentration and self-respect (confidence). I don't currently have a girlfriend, so I can't comment on whether it makes you "quick" or not, but it's definitely easier to get turned on in general. I wouldn't really worry about any negative effects in bed really, if anything, it'll improve it. But ultimately those things are secondary, what matters is behaving like a real man (keeping my dignity), and that's the key for me.</p>

<p>But if you're not married/ have a girlfriend, I would definitely include stuff like avoiding strip clubs, hookers/escorts and so on, as part of the challenge. It seems the same as porn to me, maybe worse.</p>
