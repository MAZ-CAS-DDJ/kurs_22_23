<p>Howdy. I read the Atomwaffen Division thread and it piqued my interest.<br />I'm a native PNW guy so I'm not close at all to you guys in Florida. But I'm absolutely interested in supporting your group. There are similar groups around the northwest (particularly in western Montana up in the mountains, where blacks and/or hippies trying to grow pot tend to disappear), but less on the outright national socialist side, and moreso quasi-White nationalist militias who do milsim and general /k/ stuff.<br /><br />I'm in Marine NROTC at the moment so I could bring that training to the table and moreso in the future, if I earn a commission. I go to OCS next year.<br /><br />I am stuck in Commiefornia til the end of this year. Are there any people from your organization located out west that I could network with? Maybe a western chapter could be created, similar to what the Wolves of Vinland are doing.</p>
