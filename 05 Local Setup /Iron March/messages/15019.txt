	G'day m8. I live in Melbourne myself, but I do know a fellow that runs a WN/Fascist group in Canberra. You can listen about more of it here:

	If you're interested, you can ask me to put you in contact with him. Even if you don't like the group per se, it wouldn't hurt to talk to some local shitlords from their area. Ironmarch is a pretty purist place, and generally don't see the need to meet with people who don't meet up 100% with your views, that's why I didn't mention it in the thread.
