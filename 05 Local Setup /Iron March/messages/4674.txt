<p>I don't think a fascist government could possibly be brought about without a revolution anyways, so I'm not to worried about the electoral college affecting that. And I guess it would make sense to keep the electoral college in place for a little while after we take power. But assuming voting is going to be limited to landholding males with military experience, I don't see any need to keep the electoral college. People like that would presumably vote for what is in the best interests of the country anyways.</p>
<p>I'm from Vermont. It's a beautiful state with a lot of great, hardworking people in it. It's also one of the whitest states in the union. It's a shame it votes liberal nowadays though; I don't understand it. What about you, what state are you from?</p>
