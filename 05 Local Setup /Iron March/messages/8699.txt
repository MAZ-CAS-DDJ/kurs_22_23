<p>I've done a bit of shooting, my parents own property in the country. Haven't done it in ages though so I think I'd probably be shit now. Hate fishing personally, but everyone I say that to says drinking while doing it is essential so I reckon it'd be far more tolerable if that was part of the action lol. More into cycling and just splashing around at the beach in terms of outdoor recreation, like bushwalks too which I don't do enough</p>

<p>I didn't make it to Reclaim Aus which I'm pretty disappointed over. They held it over the Easter long weekend, I'm guessing partly because fewer people would be working, but that naturally meant I was out of Perth visiting my family so I couldn't get there. Not surprised to hear that about Socialist Alliance. Was actually a member of Socialist Alliance between the age of 16-19, they played a big part in making me realise I was a nationalist &amp; kindled my hatred for Marxism. What started it was when we'd have meetings and they'd refer to Australia Day as 'Invasion Day', and talk about how all the people getting out and waving flags on Aus Day were 'racist', which I remember actually got me pretty pissed off- as did their constant talk about just letting every refugee straight into the country, didn't think of myself as racist then but I remember thinking "that is a really irresponsible idea, who will pay for them, where'll they live, our infrastructure is already struggling etc." They were just clearly not living in the real world &amp; it really helped wake me up. Kind of surprised to hear they still exist tbh, thought Socialist Alternative had taken over as the main commie group.</p>

<p>As for Aus Action and ANZAC day, I had pretty similar ideas to Quis. ANZAC is kind of a touchy subject with Aussies because of how deeply honoured it is, but I think it might get people thinking about how much that honour gels with Aus as it is at the moment if you compare ANZAC &amp; veterans' fighting to Australia today. They fought to prevent foreign invasion &amp; keep the Empire intact (i.e. for white solidarity)- now the invaders are being welcomed and Aussies are taught to hate themselves. I'm sure we can figure out how to put that sentiment into a short slogan and slap it up on posters, stickers, or stencils.</p>

<p>And finally looks like Slavros has split the ANM thread. I'll chuck my quotes up either today or tomorrow &amp; make sure to link to Jack's book Sine posted, still fucking stoked that now exists. Do either of you have a Stormfront account? I kinda can't be arsed making a new one &amp; going through that whole vetting process where they monitor your posts. I know SF is paranoid as fuck, if I make a new account &amp; the first post I make is a link to a PDF by an Aussie terrorist group it probably won't even make it past the mods. Happened once before with a thread I made there about the ANM, probably radnat (Saleam) had something to do with it.</p>
