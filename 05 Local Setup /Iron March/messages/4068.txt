<p>Me and a few of my friends have been going once or twice a year for the past two or three years, kind of like a tradition. The fact that it's so close means flights/boat trips are very cheap and Sicily itself is not too expensive (prices are more or less the same as they are here).</p>
<p>That's great btw <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" />. Do you intend on recruiting more members any time soon?</p>
