<p>Hello again Svitanok,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I just wanted to clarify that while I said that I disagreed with 'aryanism.net's' characterization of YVWH as the god of evil, the demiurge, I do reject the Jewish conception and characterization of the God which they claim but do not. Based on decades of immersion into study of the Cabbala I've come to the conclusion that the esoteric secret of Judaism is Atheist Materialism, in fact Karl Marx's Dialectical Materialism given a non-secular disguise. So in fact the Christian God, the Holy Trinity, is the real God of the Old and New Testaments in my world view, the Old Testament being a preparation and a shadow or symbol of the final revelation of God, while the 'YVWH' of Judaism (in their view) is just the dynamic universe evolving conciousness in the form of the Jews, 'god' not 'existing', but 'becoming', in the form of their Race, which they claim goes back to the same people as described in the Old Testament but is not at all. I reject their claim to Abraham, Moses, etc... or any other people, except the Canaanites perhaps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At any rate, the outcome is the same as the one seen by the people of 'aryanism.net', a struggle against the 'jews' and their spiritual poison of money and materialism.</p>
