	Hello, yes you recall right. I am orginally from The Ivory Coast and is currently living in Europe. 
</p>

	&gt; <span style="color:rgb(224,224,224);font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:26px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;float:none;background-color:rgb(28,28,28);">What's that like, if you don't mind me asking?</span>
</p>

<p>
	It was frustrating at times. When I was younger it was hard to know, what I should identify as. At times I felt like a ivorian around danes and at other times I felt like a dane around ivorians or other foreigners, since I was "raised" danish.
</p>

<p>
	When I began growing up, I realized that what I identified with, was pretty much useless. It was more important to know what I could achieve and accomplish that really mattered, not what I or other people saw me as. And I also think that is the problem with Youth today.
</p>

<p>
	They don't know who they are or what they can do. So they begin associating themself with all sorts of deviancy, because it seems <em>cool </em>to them.
</p>

<p>
	Instead of focusing on the future of finding a mate, starting a family have a nice house and job. They want to party every week, fornicate, get drunk and smoke weed. As a society we should give eachother a hand we should be able to tell eachother what is the right and wrong path, but we don't do that.
</p>

<p>
	Noone in society gives a guiding hand or leading light. 
</p>

<p>
	That's why depraved minded groups like the LGBT literally prey on the youth. They know you're most lost when you're young. They know that's the point in your life when you have to take some of the hardest choices in your life.
</p>

<p>
	Anyway I am going a bit off topic, but to put it simple my parents obviously wanted the best for me. I know that from their intentions, but the consquences and outcomes of that was not always so great.. All I can do now is live a life that is righteous in the eyes of God, while perfectly curb stomping reprobates.
</p>

Do any of them think like you do?</span>
</p>

<p>
	I don't believe there is loyalty to be found among non-Europeans immigrants. Most people today are too naive. They think because they'll give a bunch of "refugees" a home, food and water, they are automically going to be thankful and want to contribute to the society/country they are living in. 
</p>

<p>
	I know 2 girls that think like I do regarding the "migrant crises". One is iraq/iranian the other albanian(both are muslim). I've been slowly trying to convert them more and more, it's a slow process but worth it. You just got to come with few examples, of how adult refugees men act. I brought up subjects like the cologne new year rapes and provided a few vidoes for them about how refugees acts all across Europe. 
</p>

<p>
	I usually bring up many topics regarding the world and daily life. Both with males and females
</p>

<p>
	Just the other day I jokingly brought up with the iraqian one about how in the islamic world muslims throw homosexuals over the roof, she said it was good since the disease of sodomy had to be exterminated. She almost took me by surprise lmao. I almost couldn't keep the smile off my lips while I asked her questions regarding it. I tried to seem concerned to test if she was extreme in her believe or not(if it was just a act to prove something to me). She didn't backdown on her statement.
</p>

<p>
	Women can be wonderful creatures.
</p>

<p>
	Anyway thanks for the questions and nice to hear that you find my posts great. If you got anymore questions i'll be happy to answer. 
</p>

<p>
	Have a great day!
