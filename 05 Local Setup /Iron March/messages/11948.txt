<p>The whole series can have a name <em>Meet the politician with the cross , </em>since whole concept of the series is to introduce this man and his work to audience. And I think it's ok to just go from Part I to Part II Part III etc.</p>
<p>I think it would be too much havingÂ  Title of the series + Title of the current article + Part X, or if you think it can go with main title + article title I'm ok with it, but this first one shouldn't have additional title.</p>
