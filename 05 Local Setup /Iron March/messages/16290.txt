	Thanks for the information! I forgot to mention that while I was researching Algerian Fascism I have found another blog:<a href="http://numidian-soldaten.blogspot.hu/" rel="external nofollow"> http://numidian-soldaten.blogspot.hu/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Numidia is the North-Eastern part of Algeria and this guy uses Berber and Fascist symbols, so I think you should check out his blog (though it is more than likely that he is a Berberist and he writes a lot about Kabylie - let's hope he is not a separatist too).
</p>

<p>
	I got the credo and it's hierarchical arrangement. What colors should I use? I know that green is the color of Islam, and that the colors of the national flag of Algeria are white, green and red - but I don't know the correct sequence. According to the original plan it would look something like that:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	الله (green)
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar"><span>الوطن</span></span> (white)     <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar"><span>الشعب</span></span> (red)
</p>

<p>
	You have also said that I can use these words only with Allah on the top, but I wonder if I can use the same words on the green flag carried by the Eagle of Saladin:
</p>

<p>

<p>
	So the credo would be down here. Is that acceptable or not? Should I use the slogan instead?
</p>

<p>
	And you forgot to answer one of my questions: why do you choose the Coat of Arms of Transnistria for yourself? I would make a bigger version of that too, but I think we have to choose the correct heraldic colors.
</p>

<p>
	Last two questions: what CNPA stands for? I wasn't able to find the full name of the organization. And what does "El Afkar El Wataniya" means?
</p>

<p>
	The photo of the volunteers look badass! <img alt=":daggers:" data-emoticon="" src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/daggers.png" title=":daggers:" /></p>

<p>
	Thanks for the info, I am happy that I can give some help - even if it's minimal.
