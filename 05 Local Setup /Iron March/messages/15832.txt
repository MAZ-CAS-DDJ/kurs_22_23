	Hey there!

	I just want to give you a heads up that I may not be able to send money anymore or atleast not for the foreseeable future. Things seem to be moving along faster than I expected for me and I may be leaving the country sooner than I thought I would be, so I'm going to use all my money to pay off all the debts I have as quickly as possible.  If I'm able to pay off my debts before its time for me to leave the country then I will start sending money again.
