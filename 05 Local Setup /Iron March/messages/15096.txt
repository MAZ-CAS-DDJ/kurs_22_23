	Thanks for writing me back. Though like I said it will take many many years of saving up money for me to go to Italy. So, I don't suppose the next time you are in Italy you could go and see if they speak English at Preddapio and D'Annunzio's house huh? But, the idea of teaching English (or anything) in Europe is interesting. However, could I really do that with my degree though? Philosophy major and starting this semester German minor. Anyways, to answer your question I live in Missouri and I am 23 years old. Unfortunately, I waited to long to pick my minor and as a result won't graduate until 2018.
