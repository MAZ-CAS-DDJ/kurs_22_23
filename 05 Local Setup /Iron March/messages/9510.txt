<p>Blackshirt 13,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I apologize, as per usual, for the time; I've been very busy as of late. To jump right into the reply, however: that is an way to start a class. What did you (collectively) do with the knowledge of each others' beliefs from there?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How does the M65 show your fascism, if I may ask?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The big question comes now: how is "might makes right" morally justified? What's more, how does that moral justification work under a Nietzschean 'transvaluation of values' framework?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Do you have any philosophical questions for me?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, I'm neutral on neo-folk; I haven't listened to enough to render an opinion.</p>
<p> </p>
