<p>Hello Talleyrand!</p>
<p>I must say I admire your support for traditional monarchy and Christian civilization, when so many IMers can be hostile to it all. I have similar views as yours, only more Luddite and from an Orthodox stance. How did you come at to where you are?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>John.</p>
