<p>Hey man, I was just wondering what it was which convinced you and made you take up fascism over communism. IIRC you were a communist and a supporter of Tito. It got me thinking recently since I re listened to Rockwell' Nazism the only answer to communism speech, re read some more NatSoc literature and remember some of my own research and the stuff written in Mussolini's Intellectuals about the goofed predictions and the very real historical reality that "communists" had to make concessions to right wing principles on a more extreme level than even fascist groups. I remember a south slav on another forum I used to post on and got on well with who spoke with positivity of Tito's "fascism". I did some research on this myself and found that he transitioned to a co-operative based economy and it worked much better than "communism" did in other economic areas. I'm not that fond of the co-operative model, not on a large nationwide scale anyway because there are better models but after my recent revision it seems to confirm my convictions more than ever about communists having to make concessions to the "right".</p>
<p>Excuse the rambling.</p>
<p>You're a valuable member to have and an asset to fascism, as I've always said on here I value a former communist over a flavour of the month libertarian queer. I'm going o be making a thread probably in the next few days solely for communism; it'd be great if you could offer input either in that thread or over PM, especially since you came here as a communist and ended up being a fascist.</p>
<p>Have a good weekend brother.</p>
