<p>Okay this party doesn't sound too flash from what you've told me. But still, it's cool they used to be Fascist. Sounds like there are a lot of things to work on in Malta. </p>
<p>As for Australia, the two major parties are Labour, who are in charge now and they're center left and then there is Liberal who is center right. The third party is the Greens but they seem more interested in homosexual issues than the environment. As for fascist parties, well there are none. There used to be an Australian Nazi Party in the 70s. There is one party that seems okay called Australia First and there is a student activism group called Nationalist Alternative or Nat Alt for short. </p>
<p>Hope your life is going well. </p>
<p>Yours in comradeship, Cedric.</p>
