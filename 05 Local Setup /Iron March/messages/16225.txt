	Hi Bloender,
</p>

<p>
	I appreciate your contact.
</p>

	To be fair, the hostility wasn't wholly unexpected - National Socialists don't exactly receive the kindest treatment in modern society! It's also good that a thorough debate is held with new forum members to identify clear ideological grounds on all sides, challenge views, and weed out any trolls/agitators etc. Thanks for your complements though - I thought I got significantly ridiculed!

	I'm unsure about <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>. Some of their activities I've seen online look very honourable and effective (particularly supporting marginalised white communities in poor areas, and the paedophile set-up video). Being unaware of their activities and seeing them for the first time in Newcastle, I was distinctly unimpressed - although apparently I didn't hang around for long enough to see the full impact of the demonstration.

	I've done a lot of "real-world" activism on the Left, but was always a marginalised figure due to many of the cultural, political and social positions I was developing (my initial affiliation with the left was founded through an early support of Socialist economics). I don't know any significant political movements or groups in the UK that I'd like to join. It's a shame we don't have broader movements that are active in Europe, such as the <em>Identitarians </em>in France and Germany, or the <em>Nordic Resistance Movement </em>in Scandinavia. I'd definitely consider National Action, but I don't explicitly consider myself a "National Socialist", and think this may cause some (or all?) of its members to reject my engagement.

<p>
	Where abouts in the UK are you currently residing? Do you know of any interesting groups active?
</p>

<p>
	All the best,
