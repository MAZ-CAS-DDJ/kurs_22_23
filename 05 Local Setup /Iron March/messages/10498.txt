<p>I know, it seem super crazy to think about. I've never asked questions when I meet them, who knows where their hearts are. I just always think of this story:</p>
<p>Haci Bektash Veli once told one of his mursid to go take a sack of grain to a near by village where an Christian priest had prayed to God for sustenance because the village's crops had done poorly that year.</p>
<p>So the mursid takes the grain and along his way sells little bits of the grain to passer-by people. "This priest isn't even a Muslim" he thought. "So why should I bother giving him the full bounty?".</p>
<p>Eventually he arrives at the church with half the amount of grain he was sent with.</p>
<p>He meets the priest who thanks him and asks him to accompany him to worship God in thankfulness for his safe travels. The priest took the mursid to the basement of the church where, in an Eastern wall, he had dug out a mihrab and placed a candle. The priest the made sujoodnand said "oh Allah, thank you for protecting this selfish devotee and providing my people with food and blessings. " . The mursid instantly felt horror and shame at his judgement of this man and how he had given away so much of the grain. But when he looked behind him at the sack of grain, it was full again.</p>
<p>When he returned back to Haci Bektash Veli and recounted his story, Veli replied "all slaves of al-Haqq are given their just due, no matter what their shackles are made of"</p>

<p>I have never heard of this tale, thank you for sharing.</p>
<p>It can be the case as you said, yet it seems weird given that I hear "inneddine indallah ul-İslam" at every friday prayer.</p>
<p>There might be those amongst the Christians and even the Jews that have genuine belief in Tawheed, or even genuine directed worship towards God.</p>
<p>Yet I make a distinction in worship: there is worship that is pure, and there is worship that impure.</p>
<p>Both is worship, both can be directed towards Allah, but not all is approved by the word of Allah.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was just as with the Mushrik of the Makkah, who prayed to Allah during their times of need, yet also prayed to effigies and idols, some even directed to him(swt), but these were not pure in his eyes.</p>
<p>My opinion is that one's heart cannot be in two places at the same time. One cannot worship Jesus Christ and Allah at the same time, or do something that is in between. </p>
<p>This type of heresy breeds only more heresy, and it is the same kind of heresy that distorted the original message of the Torah and the Bible, which was pure monotheism, yet the Jews replaced it with the law of their Rabbis, and the Christians with their deification of Jesus Christ and his mother Mary, may Allah be pleased with them.</p>
