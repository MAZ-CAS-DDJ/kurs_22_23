<p>I agree. I will say that the happiest I have been in my life is when I have been under the guidance and control of a pure and dominant man. I have dated some of the more modern types and I found them to be indecisive and effeminate in their treatment toward me. I love to serve and submit willing to a man's will, as I feel all women should do.</p>
