			So what do you want with any of this? It's all largely mainstream discussion points that don't actually attract attention because its everywhere anyway. Stuff like this plus your symbols will come off as kind of larpy teens trying to politics.

			Also who gives a fuck about trump. Now a nice provocative poster related to the election would be something like "bernie/trump/HITLER" or "bernie/trump/ROCKWELL", the last of the three with a swastika, plus some text that frames the message, something to the extent that the two former are shills and the latter is the real deal.

	Our group is openly NatSoc so we do not mind swastikas on flyers, I would LOVE some of those Atomwaffen style flyers, especially targeted towards local colleges like UC Irvine and Soka
