	Foreal, boot camp and ITB are gonna be the easiest parts of the Marines, not gonna lie. The hikes aren't too bad, the worst one for me was the 20k and that's bc it was raining nonstop and we were the last platoon. My feet were destroyed and we had mout town right after that. The Crucible isn't that bad honestly, it sucks while you're in the middle of it but that's everything. You're gonna have a couple hell days with your DI's which will be worse. The hard part is gonna be getting to your unit and not having someone tell you what to do or not do. Work your ass off now getting ready for it and suffer less while you're there.Â
