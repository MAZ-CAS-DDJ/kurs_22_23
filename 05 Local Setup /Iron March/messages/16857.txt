	Yes. Something what directs your attention towards that which is beyond. There are people who, when they are looking at a statue, will see only something great, but we should see greatness through the great things, not only those in themselves. (This just gave me an idea for another picture.) I think intensive light is something similar to those moments in music. When you see a bonfire at night, it looks like a gap in reality; when you take a look at the Sun you can't see any colours in it, because it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescence" rel="external nofollow">so intensive</a> that it becomes white. White is above colours, black is below them.

	Look up Epicurus, his concept of Ataraxia, and the story of his death. He can be considered an Ascetic, and this shows us what Hedonism became in our era - it was accompanied by Asceticism back then, and it goes together with Modern Nihilism today.

	I have heard about Wittgenstein, our Traditionalists are admiring his works, but I haven't read anything from him yet. He was perfectly right about the Involution of language though, and that's related to the archaification I have mentioned above. This makes me wonder how did I not think of this sooner:

	Ffs, this conversation is getting more and more constructive. Hungarian Traditionalists were always saying that you can't just join to the Ummah without speaking Arabic first. We Hungarians (mainly because of our isolation) are lucky in this case, with a little effort we can read our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamentations_of_Mary" rel="external nofollow">oldest texts</a> <em>(notice the lack of political correctness in the 2nd and 11th stanzas)</em> and we also managed to save our pre-Christian runic alphabet thanks to the Szeklers living in Transylvania. I am happy to hear that Kurds were also able to conserve their heritage because the great past is one of the most valuable things we have in common (and if our tricolour wouldn't be enough my brother just informed me about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurd,_Hungary" rel="external nofollow">this</a> village).

	The Involution cannot be stopped in the outer world. One has to stop it in his inner world first to become able to do that (fighting in the outer world can be a part of your inner journey of course). In spite all of these Islam still stands. I have mentioned earlier how the Abrahamic religions are having the sign of the Dark Age on them because they were adjusted to this era to withstand it. Well, Islam is the newest among them (and probably the last since Muhammad is called the Seal of the Prophets), thus it has the greatest protection against Modernity (while Judaism became modern in order to survive). I believe you that most of the Muslims are not better than the masses, but they are still led by a Traditional religion, while the Western world has cut off itself from Christianity. This is the protection of bidding - while the tenet of mercy (and its misinterpretation) made Christianity tolerant towards Evil, Islam just won't give you a choice, and that's totally right since most of the people became unworthy to choose for themselves. Last time I had a thought about the Apocalypse, that it will be fought between "idealists" and everybody else, because that will be the last antagonism between people. This comes up a lot when I am thinking about the Involution of Islam.

	Of course you do. Even with the Treaty of Trianon we still have a country for ourselves (even if it is ruled by Jews and their servants). Geopolitics are another topic which I want to speak about with you and the other guys. You have mentioned Western Kurdistan, and I know that the Kurds living there are fighting fiercely against ISIS. Do you have any chance for independence there?

			But when we don't have fascism, I've noticed that every example I've seen so far indicates that communism is still less harmful than capitalism. Do you happen to agree with that too?

	<a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/6881-converted2islam/&amp;page=4" rel="">Yes.</a> Both Capitalism and Communism are Materialist, but Communism (at least the Eastern one) is more Idealistic. This is like choosing between Chaos and Dark Order. While the latter can be changed by changing its leaders, its ideology, etc. the former undermines the whole system with all of its categories, thus destroying the whole structure; and this combined with the Involution can lead only to a catastrophe. Some months ago I was talking with a good friend of mine about "controlled chaos" as something what the Eurasian barbarians used in battle: when they arrived to an enemy territory, the leaders unleashed some kind of frenzy which was the most effective weapon against everybody - but after they have won the leaders were able to somehow stop this frenzy and thus "contain" it. This means that Chaos is also a chance, but it is very unstable and we have to be sure that we can control it if we want to use its power. The Traditionalists would kick me in the butt for I am saying this since they see Capitalism and Communism as different, but equally destructive forces (I think Evola also writes this), but I can't help it, this is the way I see the situation.

	I can't say I am sure. I don't really know Hinduism, only some writings of Savitri Devi, but those are mainly about Hitler and cats. :D I totally agree on your journey to India though, since I am also planning a very long trip to Asia. It is no question that Tradition is more intact there. I didn't knew about the similarities between Yazdânism and Hinduism. I thought you are more closer to the Zoroastrians of Iran.

			Oh, I see. Well, when it comes to language, we're not Arabized at all. Interestingly enough, Kurdish is the purest Iranian language, and even Persian is much more Arabic in both vocabulary and spirit compared to Kurdish.

		<p>
			But when it comes to blood, sadly it's true that there's a large Semitic component within the Kurdish nation (and within other Iranian populations).

	Well, the importance of the language is clear for me now, so that's great. About the blood... you know, most of the guys on IronMarch would say that Eugenetics is the right thing to do, but as a Hungarian I know that Integralism can also work to an extent - I have Hungarian, Germanic and Slavic ancestors as well after all. According to the concept of our Traditionalists humanity is made up from four different races - the European, the Asian, the African and the Australian (the others are all mixed). Europeans and Asians are "Boreal" while Africans and Australians are "Tropical", with the Boreals as the superior races of course. (Szálasi also talks about different categories, I will try to dig that up for you.) The blood of the Semites, they say, were tainted by Tropical elements, and if that's the case then you should separate, but I still have to check that and some additional information about the Aryans in my books. Compatibility is also a question, f.ex., Christianity was compatible with the Greco-Roman culture, which later integrated the Barbarians as well. Integration and mixing are two different things, that's what the Hindu society was built upon - and that could be your answer too. You will have to implement more defensive measures given the fact that even if Hinduism is still a living Tradition, it wasn't able to avoid the mixing of the castes.

	Rockwell was right about that statement, but most of the time his thinking is overly Materialistic. Classical Racism is accepted by us, but Spiritual Racism will be always more important.
