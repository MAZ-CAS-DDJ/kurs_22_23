<p>Well i like the debates too but what is the common matter that i will debate with them ? That their problem will not be solved instant. I think they know it already if they not it will be worthy to talk with complete idiots? I think they just want to stop thing going bad then now.</p>
<p>Nevertheless i will see their thread when i found it <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> and maybe ask them thing or two...</p>
