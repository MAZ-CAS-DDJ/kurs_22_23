<p>Hi! If you are outside of Europe you can go to the following address: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/olena.semenyaka" rel="external nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/olena.semenyaka</a></p>
<p>She is the person I was coordinating with. However everyone should have gone to Ukraine a month ago, I'm not sure if she can still help.</p>
<p>If you are in Europe you can also email Gaston Besson and ask about joining Azov battalion. gastonbesson@yahoo.com</p>

<p>Thank you, and you are correct...I am in Europe now but I have been in Mexico for the past 5 months.  I did make a little contact yesterday  and this was part of the response: " But most of those men wants to join to Azov and now question about foreigners in Azov is very difficult.</p>
<p>Thanks for support!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I did suggest that they might consider forming units made up of foreigners something like La Légion étrangére under Ukrainian officers.</p>
<p>I do not expect this ceasefire to be effective.</p>
