	We have hippy's around here, but they preach the same shit and clutch their purse and keys when they do see a brown person so they are slightly better. They will all smoke themselves retarded and wither away rather fast. All of my friends are race realists and most even aware of the JQ to some extent but a few are cucked. They are toÂ complacent or dont think its as bad as it really is though or think its to late to change so worthless for doing anything until shit hits the fan at least. No antifa around here but i wouldnt have to go far to find them i would fair to say as im close to Cleveland, Canton and some other bigger places but i never associated with those types to actually know any, i'v always been on the right of the spectrum some place. I would love to provoke some of them though i see them online and it makes my blood fucking boil
