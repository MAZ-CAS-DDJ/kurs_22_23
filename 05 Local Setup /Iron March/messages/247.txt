<p>Cordial Greetings,</p>
<p>I was wondering what the official policy was regarding warnings is. Is it procedure to add to the warning bar or no? I'm asking because I noted that, after your warning to our favorite new antifa, you didn't add to his warning bar. Was that simply an oversight, or have I been doing something wrong? I'm always a little heisitant in regards to actions I undertake ad a mod; so I wanted to be sure.</p>
<p>Felix Dies Natalis Solis Invicti &amp; Merry Christmas,</p>
