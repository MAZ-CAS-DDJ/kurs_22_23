	Also, I think it may be possibleÂ that humans can serve as unknowing vessels for the Gods. I think Hitler may have been the incarnation of the force/archetype that we call Odin/Wotan - if you look at my profile picture, its a painting of Odin partaking in the Wild Hunt - and who does Odin look like? Hitler! This was painted before Hitler was even born; it's almost like the artist unconsciously "predicated" Hitler's arrival. I'm not saying this is all inerrant "proof" of something, but it just makes ya think, y'know?
