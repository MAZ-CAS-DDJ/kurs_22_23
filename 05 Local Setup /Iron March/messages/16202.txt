	Hi there,
</p>

<p>

<p>
	I saw your thread in the Introduction section and some of what you said caught my interest, so I thought I'd send you a message. Looks like things didn't go quite to plan for you in that thread, but that's pretty typical an introduction thread. You rarely get the opportunity for much high quality discussion there, and for the most part they seem to be about giving you enough rope to hang yourself with. Write too little, and you'll get stick for that. Write too much, and it provides ample opportunity for some eagle-eyed autist to find a minor doctrinal disagreement to pick on and milk for a few pages of bickering. For the most part I thought you did well to keep your cool, and came across as sincere and reasonably well-grounded in your views.

	Personally I'm less interested in petty doctrinal bickering and more interested in making contacts and trying to build something real with like-minded people, and as a fellow Brit I was interested in your take on <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>. Obviously the posters here push them pretty hard, but what are your own feelings about them? From what you wrote about your own encounter with them it sounded like you were less than impressed with on the day, do you still feel the same about it? Are there any other groups in the UK that you've been interested in getting involved with? If not, what do you intend to do from this point in terms of transitioning your political views into some sort of real-world activity?

	Anyway don't let that thread discourage you. This place has value as a learning resource, you just have to be picky about where and how you engage with people.

	Hope to hear from you soon,
