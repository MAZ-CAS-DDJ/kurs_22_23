<p>Well in modern democracies its illegal to have military like chain of command in political movements. So dont expect ranks in their military meaning sometimes there are not insignia indicating member rank and org status. More like persons in charge for specific subdivisions: Propaganda, Public relations, Sport org, Humanitarian corps, Protection unit... Mainly depend on internal structure of targeted organization.. Most of all its not necessary to be a mass movement to be effective one. Some of bigger movements are really  clumsy because they lack effective division of labor and cooperation between different wings within. Lack of communication buried not one or two organizations just look what happen with "Spanish falange" movement.  They fragmented on basic components because their fail to coordinate also personal dislike between regional leaders have it role too..</p>
<p>As for the music metal mostly : Slayer, Cannibal Corpse, Sodom, Motorhead, Pantera, Immortal, Marduk mostly fast and joy music i dont like slow and melancholic ones, its way depressing for me. Also im fan of Pagan/Folk metal and our folklore etc..</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
