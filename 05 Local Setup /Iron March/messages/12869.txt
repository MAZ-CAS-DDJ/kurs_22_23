	Valincius, who has registered today to forums are our Graphics guy from Skydas. He is far more talented at graphic design than I am. He creates most of our memes, artwork and etc. He created our "Degeneracy = Jews" banner, which we used on March 11. (Our first video)<br /><br />
	I could try to do those designs myself, but I'm not using any fancy programs like photoshop or corel, because my aspiration is video art and a bit of photography.Â <br /><br />
	Ofcourse I would love to learn the magic of graphic design, but with books and video projects under my sleeve, I have no desire to concentrate on something I know very little, then I can improve there I'm best at.
