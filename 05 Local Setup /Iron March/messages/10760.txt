<p>I wouldn't be posting publicly. Chances are if they made an arrest they know about IronMarch and chances are they're gonna see everything that's public.<br /><br />Prayers, because that's all I can do. That's fucking FSB and for all we know they're going after him for his support of Azov. That's an assumption on my part but if that's the case he's pretty much fucked because this is a lot.<br /><br />Chances are they're gonna get his information and start scanning shit.</p>
