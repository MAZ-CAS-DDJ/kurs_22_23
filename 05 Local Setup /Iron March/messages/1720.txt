<p>NatCap,</p>
<p>I hate to be rude, but you do owe me an explanation. When I said in that thread that I wanted you to explain that post immediately, I meant that in the context of a moderator. I was not asking you to do something, but telling you. You are to tell me immediately what you meant by that post. I <em>am not</em> asking you.</p>
<p>Yours cordially,</p>
<p>Dux</p>

<p>I meant nothing other than what was stated. Refer to FascistCapitalist's post on the matter.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>NatCap</p>
