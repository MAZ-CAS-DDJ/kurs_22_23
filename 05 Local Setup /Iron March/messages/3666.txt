<p>Good question.</p>
<p>Philippine Nationalism</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ca/doodz/philippines3.html" rel="external nofollow">http://www.angelfire...ilippines3.html</a> last part of the article shows the sad state of our nationalism.</p>
<p><a href="http://mnnetherlands.com/dir/_page/102092/" rel="external nofollow">http://mnnetherlands...r/_page/102092/</a></p>
<p>nationalism is often confused with patriotism. I mean, if they mean nationalist, they say "proud to be pinoy" while being pro-yankee in spirit, not getting from better inspirations like the Khomeinists.</p>
<p>About 3P movements (only one exists i think)</p>

<p>To be honest, I am willing to work with them, and even give up some of my ideas, as my mission (and theirs) is to save our country, not to remake my country out of my personality (totally), unless they are pro-us as well. Any pro-us in their movements, would make me leave. They are a bit active, i think. But they're not the Golden Dawn level or that of Noyles' level. I should really introduce them here.</p>
<p>We had these once</p>

<p>There are considerations in our nationalism</p>
<p>We are geographically divided, plus landlordism (must die!), is trying to kill it, plus pro-americanism amongst many people here (unfortunately). Proof?</p>

<p>Regards of plans, Hmm.</p>
<p>First of all, ties to the yanks will be lessened/eliminated, and more ties of friendship to oppressed countries and enemies of liberalism (Iran, Syria, Zimbabwe, and so on, and possibly in the future, TotalitarianSocialist's Volkstaat). China will be considered as a neighbor, and Spratlys islands cannot be owned by Chinese alone. Us Southeast Asians will own the islands, respectively going to any island's nearest country, geographically.</p>
<p>Crime shall be solved with labor-based punishment. Death Penalty and Penal battalions (labor and military alike) will be established. Corrupt officials and nasty criminals (rapists, pedophiles, traitors), will be punished by severity. Lowest punishment is jailtime or labor, highest is public execution and/or public torture.</p>
<p>Culture shall be given a big boost. Music/other media shall have Filipino characteristics. One can still watch/listen to foreign stuff, since such media could be used as an inspiration to make our own. New forms shall be encouraged as long as it has Pro-state/pro-Filipino/pro labor themes.</p>
<p>Removing Colonial characteristics that hurt the country is a must (as the spanish + yanks included bad things in their colonial raping, like democracy). Immigration is ok for foreigners and Filipinos alike, as long as foreigners will obey our rules + assimilate + immigration to be limited, and Filipinos will do the same thing in other countries. Those who have skills shall not be allowed to go out to the country for jobs, nor shall the unskilled. Filipinos will only go as respectful and considerate tourists. Foreigners in my country can live with us, provide they behave nicely + assimilate + don't come in numbers. Filipinos from other countries should assimilate ASAP.</p>
<p>Military shall be given a big boost too. It shall be on the top priority. Muslim rebels will be talked (as they belong to the same fatherland and desire a better country + they belong to the same culture), while communist rebels/private armies will be eliminated. Guns taken from the enemy shall be given to loyal persons and to veterans. State intelligence and Organizations for the state and nation shall be given top priority. Equipment will come from our own people's hands or from newly found allies.</p>
<p>Economy shall either be State Socialism, Syndicalism or Corporatism with considerations to my country, so it would both be nation wide, and all islands given priority + class collaboration. Since we have debts, the debts from the us government can go to hell. Labor shall be given a boost, with medals for those who work a lot. Major industries are to be government owned. private companies are ok, unless they are mistreating the workers and the locals alike. Also, economic immigration to other lands will be and foremost restricted. </p>
<p>Religion shall have no priority in the state. There are Muslim Filipinos and others, so no religion shall be given a damn. We will only worship our state, our heroes from the past, the leaders, and our nation as a whole. They can keep their religions, as long as they give priority to the state and to the leaders. The rich shall be allowed to stay, as long as they obey the government, and support the people. Middle class, same thing and rules. Those who do leave and side with the enemy shall be imprisoned/exterminated  and lots of Filipinos work for the US government, so they will have persona non grata for status, and the name "race traitor", unless they prove that they need it for survival of their families. If They go back to serve the country, good. If they are oppositionists, they go to labor prison.</p>
<p>Population control shall be given a big boost. People should consider to produce with quality, not in number. Abortion is a yes, for rape victims, pre-21 year old mothers or mothers who might die. Parenting Licences shall be issued to those with good genes and merit, and shall be checked for behavior towards children, and their children as well.</p>
<p>The language shall have big boosts as well, using local terminology or self made terminology, and to modify it for everyday and formal use alike. Dialects can be used, but giving priority to State Language (filipino) is a big yes.</p>
<p>The system of government is a one-party state, but with 2/3s restrictions on freedom of speech, as long as it isn't totally anti-state + Guardian Council. Opposition shall be destroyed politely, as there are fakecialists who can be converted, unless they do oppose  my government for real. Autonomous regions shall be dismantled, and all citizens of it shall be considered as Filipinos, no special "but". Tribal persons shall be considered Filipino citizens, and we shall look upon their character.</p>
<p>Values shall be kept, indecency frowned upon , and social conservatism shall be a big must.</p>
<p>Technology should be an obvious emphasis as well.</p>
<p>As for Moro Separatism, they do have a good reason to separate, but nonetheless they should not. Moro culture is totally different from Luzon/Visayas/Christian Mindanao culture, true, but nevertheless, it's a permanent part of it as well. They also share the same blood as us from Luzon/Visayas, and they also have the nationalist and warrior spirit.</p>
<p>However, as my Country is dying under recent multi-culturalism and neoconism (most are under the spell of the neocon/liberal/maoist here), I have no choice but to support the Moro Separatists, as they want to distance themselves from Luzon/Visayas culture that is becoming totally globalized (which is worse), unless they be persuaded to unite themselves for our country, and still keep their culture from getting poisoned. But the good thing here is at least most of us (even Muslims, and even assimilated spaniards+chinese+so on) consider ourselves to be Filipinos, even the Spaniards who live here consider themselves as Filipinos, yet can speak Spanish + any other language (in the case of others) and Filipino (not like the Russians/Jews/Gypsies in your country who refuse to assimilate).</p>
<p>If you are to ask about the communist rebels here, there is no doubt they've got to give up or die, they're annoying, they're "muh democracy!". basically our own PMOI. Except they still are here, which is a bad thing.</p>
<p>As you have told us of the Gopnik, we have these, probably because of Mexican/US influence, (like the telenovelas)</p>

<p>the website might be liberal, but this is the truth. I do not agree with their ideas, but their criticism is great.</p>
<p>At least you know about the Moro Separatists, than knowing my country as a place of entertainers + domestic helpers + nurses + overraped country (which is true anyway, but my fellow Filipinos will go butthurt). To be honest, our country has been in the gutter because only a few considered violence. Qutb was and is right. Because we were under the yanks, we became empty spiritually.</p>
