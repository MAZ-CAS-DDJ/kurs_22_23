	How do you propose to "keep the system" if the entire thing from top to bottom and bottom to top is egalitarian ingrained belief system.

	Have you read<a href="http://ropeculture.org/2017/01/13/zero-tolerance/" rel="external nofollow"> Zero Tolerance</a>?: 'To ensure the global dominance of <strong>Truth</strong> on Earth, <strong>worldwide</strong>, <em>without exceptions</em>, manifested in the form of <strong>Organic States</strong> that are rooted in selfless service and duty â€“ it is rooted in a loyalty to something more than human and thus eternal and unchanging. Fascist/NS economic and social concepts are thus not derived out of utilitarian concerns for material goals and the human imagination trying to produce the best working system, but only from the eternal laws of Truth, which dictates only one possible solution in all matters, and Fascism/NS is the sole force on earth to be motivated by these eternal laws. '

	It just seems really bizarre why you invoke fascism and yet are not presenting any real argument as to why the system should or can be preserved while the system becomes fascist &amp; while you stay true to your principles, ie belief into action.
