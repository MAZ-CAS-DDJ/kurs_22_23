<p>Nice to meet you too, Emma. You had a project about Ljubljana in sixth-grade? Wow, I didn't think you learn about our city in USA. Yeah, that was one old wheel they found. I live near the castle in the center of the city, this is <em>the </em>Ljubljana castle, other castles in the city are the castles of some noblemen from baroque era or something like that. My neighbourhood: <a href="http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/t1.0-0/543808_599877170038885_460695834_n.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/t1.0-0/543808_599877170038885_460695834_n.jpg</a></p>

<p>I don't know which books I'd recommend, it depends what you're interested in. If you're looking for books about Croatian history in general I'd say <em>Croatia: A Nation Forged in War</em> by Marcus Tanner. If you're interested in something specific, I'd recommend this website: <a href="http://hrcak.srce.hr/" rel="external nofollow">http://hrcak.srce.hr/</a> They have many articles dealing with Croatian history in English there. For example, if you're interested in fascist Ustasha legacy, I made a quick search, this looks interesting: <a href="http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=80853" rel="external nofollow">http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=80853</a> Obviously though, everything written about 20th century history of Croatia, ie. dealing with the period from 1918 on will be controversial and you should be sceptical about what you read, look for pieces of truth in different publications.</p>

<p>I can help you with learning Croatian sure, no problem. There's a mistake in what you wrote ("<span>Ja</span> <span>ga</span> <span>ne želim</span><span>.</span> <span>Možete ga</span> <span>imati</span><span>.</span> <span>On</span> <span>je</span> <span>predebela</span> <span>za mene</span><span>."), it's either "On<strong>a</strong> je predebela za mene" (she is too fat for me) or </span>"On je predebe<strong>o</strong> za mene" (he is too fat for me). In Croatian, adjectives are different when you speak about different genders. <em>Debeo</em> (fat) would be used when speaking about something that is in male (grammatical) gender, and <em>debela</em> (also fat) when in female and <em>debelo</em> when in neutral. <em>Pre</em>debeo means too fat (or overweight, <em>pre</em> is basically like over in English). On/ona/ono is like what you he in English, he/she/it. I think the characteristics of grammatical gender in Croatian language is explained well on this blog: <a href="http://basic-croatian.blogspot.com/2009/01/7-gender.html" rel="external nofollow">http://basic-croatian.blogspot.com/2009/01/7-gender.html</a> As you can see on the tables of contents, he deals with everything you need to know for knowledge of basic Croatian. I think it's a good blog and great for start, I see the comments are positive too. When you'll need anything just ask, obviously you'll need much help because it's a difficult language to learn but don't give up.</p>

<p>I'd prefer Croatia over Sweden if I was you too, Central Europe is just much more interesting and less politically correct. The only problem is that Croatia is horrible economically and is in a bit of crisis.</p>

<p>I chosed name Torquemada after Spanish inquisitor Tomas de Torquemada. Can't say my first name here because it's rare and would basically give up my identity, which I don't want to do on a place like this, you can add me on Facebook or on Skype though.</p>
