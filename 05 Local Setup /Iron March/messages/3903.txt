<p>Ya, I think some of the members here should be more tolerant towards new members. Our movement is small enough we don't need to be turning away potential recruits. I guess some people here feel the need to compensate for some personal shortcomings by making the newbies feel inadequate. Oh well, it's still the only fascist forum on the internet and it sure beats Stormfront.</p>
<p>I agree with you on the Spanish Civil War, it's absolutely fascinating. One of the few times in modern history where the good guys actually win. I just think it's dissapointing that Franco never applied the teachings of the Falange while in power. He would have had little opposition to any installment of their programs. Spain could have been fascist Italy without WWII getting in the way and screwing everything up. Unfortunately as with all conservative dictatorships his regime lacked the revolutionary spirit needed to combat the decay all societies are subject to, and which Marxism feeds on.</p>
