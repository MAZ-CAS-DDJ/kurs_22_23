<p>''by the way, i can guess you are from Norway, and a Christian, who fights for the revival of national identity, how do you explain Christianity as a part of your national identity, and what are your thoughts on revival of Paganism (or at least pagan values and traditions) (i am not attacking, just curious of your thoughts)''</p>
<p>Well, thats very easy. Christianity has been in Norway since year 800 over 1000 years! Most of our Kings have been Christian and Norway was at its greatest in the Christian rule, know as the Norwegian Domination. (Norgesveldet) And in a choice between Christianity being the main religion and Paganism it's obvious it's Christianity, not only with the Historic facts but Norse Paganism is Mythology, it has a bunch of flaws, Christianity is theology. And most real Pagans are just autistic viking wannabes ''HURR IM A VIKING''</p>
<p>Revival of Paganism? I love it, that traditions and values are being resolved. But they are beliefs are totally shit, and they use more of their time whining at Christians and listening to bad metal music that worshipping their gods</p>
