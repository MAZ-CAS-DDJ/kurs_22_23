<p>I've been pretty busy with school lately. I am studying economics and higher level math. That is why I didn't reply earlier. Yes, I think we will get along well.</p>
<p>As for your racial rankings, I mostly agree but with a few differences. I don't know what you mean by energy level but it seems to me that mongoloids tend to have a great deal of discipline, tenacity, staying-power etc. They seem energetic to me.</p>
<p>I am also not sure that general intelligence ought to be thought of as something completely separate and apart from creativity. By general intelligence you must be referring to g which is the "general factor" of intelligence as measured by IQ tests. But, though IQ tests are usually a good proxy for intelligence, I am not at all convinced that there isn't a great deal more to intelligence, as commonly understood, than that which is revealed by IQ tests. I think that IQ tests are limited by their time constrained nature and by the fact that they are designed so as to test abilities which do not require much knowledge. I suspect there is a type of intelligence which doesn't manifest very well in severely time constrained contexts and which best demonstrates its usefulness within knowledge heavy contexts. I am thinking of various sorts of abstract and analytical thinking. I suspect that Mongoloids are deficient relative to Whites wrt this other form of intelligence. You could perhaps call it creativity.</p>
<p>Also, I think it has recently been shown that Mongoloids born and raised in the West actually score higher than Whites on the verbal sections of IQ tests and not only the math/visual sections. See the SAT results for instance.</p>
<p>You need not fell the need to reply point by point, I just thought I'd let you know what I thought about your rankings.</p>
<p>I recall reading a post from you in which you revealed that you are a 1st year psychology student at university. I used to write essays in high school pretending to be leftwing so as to satisfy the teachers and stay out of trouble. It worked and my psych/anthro/sociology teacher said that he thought I was his best student. If you are not already, I would strongly suggest that you do the same or switch to a different major.  Leftists can be very nasty people and  psychology departments are filled with such obnoxious leftists.</p>
