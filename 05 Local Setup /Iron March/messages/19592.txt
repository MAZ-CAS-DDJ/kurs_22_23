			Alright so I have got more than a few question on what is going on here that I haven't gotten answered yet, even with the official statement.
		</p>

		<p>
			On wessies' Muslim cliche:
		</p>

		<p>
			 - These people have been kicked out of the organization, but they still have knowledge of how these kinds of groups work.  Can we get a list of names of people to avoid to prevent similar things happening?
		</p>

		<p>
			 - How devoted were they to wessie, are they willing to turn violent like he was?  How much training do they have?  How much of a physical threat do they pose?
		</p>

		<p>
			 - Do we know if his ring extends beyond AW?  What else do we know about his activities?
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			On wessie himself:
		</p>

		<p>
			 - All the reports I have found say that he is still alive, is this correct?
		</p>

		<p>
			 - He held up a store as well?  Did anything actually happen or was he just doing it for publicity?

		Good idea, I'll get that to the AW guys that we need a list of these fuckers. However its not like they are hiding their behavior or their muslim attitudes.

		Devoted enough to at least praise his actions online and say he had done nothing wrong and that the AW guys deserved it for being non-believers. I doubt they have any sort of real training however, they were a small group that nobody in AW liked. They likewise probably pose no real danger, especially without Devon to actually coordinate them.

		No information of this kind.

		Yes he's correct and in custody, he's talking to the feds, that's the only reason Odin was arrested, all of this is in the media reports.
