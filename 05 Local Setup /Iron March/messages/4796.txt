<p>No, I've nothing to boast about myself. Although I speak to others who consider themselves English nationalists, or radicals at the very least. I've spoken to representatives of various parties but have found them wanting. I'm still a student, and have limited resources. But I'm doing my best to seek out like-minded individuals and opportunities for myself. </p>
<p>Thank you for sending my blog around, it's only small but I enjoy articulating my own views from time to time. </p>
