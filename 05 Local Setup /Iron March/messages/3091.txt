<p>This is what I support. Christians and Muslims are closer. Both are non-materialist religions. Islam prohibits usury and modern-day finance. Islamic economic jurisprudence has even been supported by Nick Griffin of the BNP. Not to mention, Christians are respected due to their People of the Book status.</p>
<p>Islam has done some wrong though such as the conquest of Constantinople which should have been left to a Greek Christian vassal of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
