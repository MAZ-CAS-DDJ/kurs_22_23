	Most people are to dumb to know the difference in SS units they think I'm a Sargent or something cause I have a lion on my collar rather than the runes.Â  Polish para is pretty cool. It's not to expensive to do. I'd like to start my own polish para unit. The guys that do it now are all way to old to do it.
