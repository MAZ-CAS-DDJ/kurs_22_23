<p>No, you started this by bringing up something highly questionable and then persisting to act out like everyone should acknowledge that, i.e. how you call people peasants and etc. You didn't expect to be put down for that?</p>

<p>For one thing it apparently gets you to grovel in PM to change your title and it revealed that you are fascap if he were bragging his heritage instead of his "business prowess".</p>

<p>I don't want spergs and shitposters on the forum, that's for sure, hence why I always pushed to get rid of fascap and his twin - one down, one to go, and you're on the horizon batting to be the fascap of "nobility". Also learn to abbreviate according to the community standards, we just call it IM.</p>

<p>As a sperg that just HAS to act out on this bullshit of being nobility you just couldn't resist the notion of calling yourself a "benign entity", could you?</p>

<p>That's the fucking point. You can't shut the fuck up about your heritage, ergo you get beat down for your heritage.</p>

<p>That would've been the way to go from the start, yes.</p>

<p>Rather simple for a fascist to be a Stalinist if he's Russian. Red Fascism is what they called Stalin's Socialism in One State. You should've read some of those topics I posted just before you earned the new title.</p>

<p>Enjoy your new title.</p>
