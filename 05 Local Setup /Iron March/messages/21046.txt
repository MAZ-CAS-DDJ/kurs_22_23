	Kalki (Destroyer of Filth/Harbinger of the End Time) is the 9th and last avatar of Vishnu. Hitler is Kalki in human form. At the very end of Kali Yuga, our current and final age, Kalki will appear in his purest form, riding a white horse, and will lead us into the Golden Age, but will leave behind the weak and the subhumans.
