<p>Yeah I agree, I remember my philosophy teacher saying "reactionary" like he was talking about ringworms and then openly calling himself a Marxist and I stopped listening to those lectures afterwards </p>
<p>Most of my peers are getting worthless degrees but acting like entitled shits about it. </p>
<p>I should have stayed in Alaska, Wotan, God, Jupiter please destroy California lol</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah liberalism is a new religion in a way, with its own doctrines and crusades. But it's like an anti-religion, instead of adding to cultures or replacing them it destroys them entirely </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah I prefer physical work to desk jobs, its what humans were supposed to do. I hate sitting and being inside all the time, especially for work. My major is Biology but I'm terribad at math unfortunately, I'm trying to learn though. If that doesnt go through trade school is my best option. </p>

<p>As much as I shit-talk and seem pessimistic I'm pretty optimistic about the future. The next incarnation of the Aryan spirit will come soon, maybe it is all of us at once. The next Hitler/Mussolini will arise soon, with how shitty liberalism is its only matter of time</p>
