	I will admit the physical strength part was mostly my libido talking. But I much prefer natural-looking muscle which it looks like a guy got from simply playing a sport or a hard day's work, which will inevitably have some small amount of fat around it. Gym-rat muscle is rarely as appealing, though there are exceptions in the heavyweight category where it starts approaching natural muscle in appearance when rested. The "swimmer's body"/"lightweight bodybuilder" thing is honestly something I associate with gay guys?<br /><br />
	Combat sports are a huge plus. I feel protected around a guy who has actual, useful physical strength. Also mental fortitude is a must.
