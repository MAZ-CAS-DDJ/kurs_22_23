<p>Sent a PM to Goyles and got you validated and I can send you PMs now so you should be able to post as normal now if you can read this. The member base (namely the admins) like new members to introduce themselves before jumping into discussions.</p>
<p>Glad to see another calvinist on here, especially one who's not afraid of the fascist label. A lot of calvinists I've been running into both online and offline have been of the libertarian and anti-fascist persuasion out of what I think is to appeal to the popularity of the masses. We've got a few catholics on here but they don't slate protestantism that often and I just give em a jab about their Jewish like standards now and then when they do, most of the time we just concentrate on the areas we do agree. It's easy to get along here so long as you can give and take a bit of banter. The site isn't a movement, it's just a discussion board.</p>
<p>I think you'll like the theonomy thread we have in particular:</p>
