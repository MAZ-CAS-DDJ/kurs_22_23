<p>Not sure if that works with PM's but we do have autosave on posts, its only noted as small faint text on the bottom bar of the window where you post the message in, left corner. Probably won't help you now because it could've spent time re-recording the new message in place of the old one provided the function works with PMs but just so you know in the future in case you loose something you try to post to the forum.</p>

<p>I mostly just go by what Evola had to say on drugs in this regard, namely that it's not the drugs that are the problem but who uses them as it affects the outcome, plebs degenerate, patricians thrive, albeit he did say in Ride the Tiger that they are just substitutes for the real experience of the spiritual world. Either way my own take is that I am willing to try certain things but to a certain limit, before I read that evaluation of drugs by Evola I was a staunch opponent of drug use, the Russian nationalist scene at large is very anti-drug as a response to the massive social decay in the 90s, so here it is now a nationalist standard that all drugs are bad, including alcohol and cigarettes, so those are banned at many nationalist events. I'd still say that as far as social policy goes drugs should become more so a privilege of certain elites. Alcohol and cigarettes are just pleb drugs tho, would remove those entirely.</p>

<p>Figured you may know him and that he'd be interested in projects like yours and the Wolves of Vinland.</p>

<p>Fascinating experience. Well I may get initiated into the jackboot shamanism this summer, we've got a trip planned with certain forum users, a real life IronMarch meetup is overdue.</p>

<p>And we don't have a thread on fitness we have an <a data-ipb="nomediaparse" href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/forum/90-sport-fitness/" rel="">entire dedicated subforum</a> so I'm sure you can make good use of it with a dedicated Centurion Method topic, like I have a <a data-ipb="nomediaparse" href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/3261-fascism-restoring-tradition/" rel="">dedicated topic</a> to showcasing some basics of my research in theory as a precursor to the book I'm planning. Currently reading Evola's Hermetic Tradition and its already yielding important information that expands on what I wrote in the topic.</p>

<p>I'd also like to say that I'm very glad to have you on the forum, IronMarch is pretty much the only legitimate fascist community online (stormfront fags pussyfoot around too much) so I'm always pleased to see people who actually have contributed something for the struggle are joining, a sort of "British Union of Fascists effect" with how they attracted many people who had already established a name for themselves in society. Now if only we could get Jack Donovan, Kai Murros, Golden Dawn, Casa Pound and the Nordic Resistance to establish a presence on IM <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_ironmarchy.png" alt=":ironmarchy:"> Although Kai and Resistance are actually well aware of us, one of our Finnish users had recently met Kai in person.</p>
