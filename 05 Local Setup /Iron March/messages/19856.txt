	Hey mate it's nice to see another Aussie figure out what's really going in the world! I've always kinda felt like a minority considering I'm in a very left wing area anyway, since you're new and since we're both Aussies I think we should stick together. (Sorry if this seems like a half ass introduction I'm used to people meeting me)
