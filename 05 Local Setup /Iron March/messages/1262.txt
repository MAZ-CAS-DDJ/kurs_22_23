<p>Look I don't know if it was you but someone was being rather disrespectful to me on the Black Corps thread. If it was you I'm not mad but I like to treat everyone on Iron March with respect in all aspects. All I ask is the same in return. I hope that this can be resolved in a mature way. It was a mistunderstanding. </p>
<p>I messed up while hoping to contribute to the forums as a mod and I apologize for that.</p>
