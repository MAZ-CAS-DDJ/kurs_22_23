<p>Sounds familiar, my fascism really crystalized from just historical/heritage appreciation into real radicalism once I was in high school and surrounded by niggers. I don't understand why there aren't more redpilled in Baltimore, whites here must be fucking imbeciles.</p>

<p>I used to be into paganism in a kinda spergy way because folk metal is damn cool and Thor is badass, but it's nothing to do with my real heritage and I will be returning to trad catholicism soon. I really like runes though and did a lot of real study on them.</p>

<p>I was kinda late on realizing the jewish problem, it happened after I joined this forum, but I saw how what they have done to this world is the exact opposite of my ideals. I was a little sceptical on the Nazis until I read Leon Degrelle's works, Hitler's Revolution by Richard Tedor, and Mein Kampf itself. Although national socialism isn't my heritage/aesthetic I definitely appreciate it.</p>
