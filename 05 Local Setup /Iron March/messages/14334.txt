	Sadly no, not his side of the family at least. They're kinda fucked up, his own parents didn't even come to his memorial and his land whale half sister hasn't spoken to us since we refused to lend her any more money. Its an embarrassment really. My mother and I are on good terms at least and she was there with all her friends and family. Did your father have any relatives around besides you?
