<p>Yes, "ovo je" means "this is". Basically "ovo je kuča" is "this is a house" and "ovo je Ana" is "this is Ana". If that's what you meant.</p>

<p>When you get computer I can give you more help. I just talked with my friend, we'll organize German lessons at my place, me and 3 friends of mine from "fascist" scene. It's the same guys who helped me organized my underground boxing club, we're trying to develop ourselves following the "Aryan" ideal.. Sports, education, knowledge.. I'm glad that those few of us who're serious got together and started to organize something meaningful, before it was only drinking and drugs and degenerate lifestyle. I started with healthy diet in august and I increased my activity in sports to 5 trainings a week, and I'm really happy with the way I live my life right now.</p>
