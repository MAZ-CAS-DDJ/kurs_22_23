<p>I think the reason they tend to look down on protestantism is because they erroneously equate protestantism with liberalism, which is absurd, if anything catholicism has much more in common with liberalism and the catholic church has actively helped advance many liberal causes, but I digress. I tend to avoid arguing with them, especially if they're fellow nationalists, it's not worth it. I get on better with Orthodox Christians but the differences are still significant enough to disagree with them.</p>
<p>Bibles are tricky things, without Strong's Concordance withHebrew and Greek Lexicon interpreting the true message of the bible can be very difficult. Needless to say, I'm not fond of the KJV, which adds to confusion by adding words which should not be there into the bible. I mainly refer to the 1599 Geneva bible (I personally find Calvin's commentary in it to be interesting at times too) and then Young's Literal Translation, New International Version, Tyndale bible and the Septuagint. Rarely do I refer to the KJV, as I call it the knock-off jew version, lol. As I said, it's a lot of work and a lot of research, I still have regular discussions with fellow Christians myself.</p>
