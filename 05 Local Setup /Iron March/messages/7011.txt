<p> </p>
<p>Here are some of their posters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the war they were handed over to Yugo commies by the British and commies brutally massacred all of those who were returned, 14.000 of them. I mean, what kind of sick society murders so many unarmed people after the war? Most of them were children of peasants who enlisted after bolsheviks butchered half of the country, their average age was like 20.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is why our Church gets so much respect by far right and NS people here, they organized these units, they were their biggest moral support in the fight against evil. And during the communist regime, the Church was the only flame of resistance. You see, this was just some unit of peasants, but they were undeafeated during the war (only had like 1000-2000 losses, partisans had much more) and with their sacrifice they gave us something more - true martyrs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is why our regular right wing is a bit more "radical" than in other countries (especially if compared to Western Europe), crimes like these simply aren't forgotten by population. Our country lost more than 6.5% of people during the war and mostly because of senseless violence of the bolsheviks (which then caused reaction), some regions lost more than 15%. The left always plays the victim, but acts like a bully when it can. The problem is that IMO in countries where they never had a chance to commit violence on such level (western Europe) leftists get away with this hypocrisy. Here they're cynical about victims of red terror but want us to remember "muh holocaust" and moralize about attacks on gays...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For us here it's easy to simply hate them. I read story after story of red terror, perhaps I'd translate some of them and post them here so everyone can see how sadistic bolsheviks were. Imagine a 17 year old Anti-FA punk deciding who lives or dies, because that was basically what happened here during and after the war, when individual partisans were sending people to different camps... I remember a story of a mother who lost all of her 4 sons to red terror, one of them sadistically killed only because he belonged to some Catholic movement before the war, and she couldn't even tell anyone about her tragedy for 45 years. The story of local German ethnic minority is also extremely sad. We're basically the land of mass graves <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_graves_in_Slovenia" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_graves_in_Slovenia</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the other hand we simply admire the dignity that the Catholic anti-Bolshevik community preserved during communism. Some villages were deliberately neglected by the regime if they had a large number of inhabitants participating in anti-communist struggle and they wouldn't build schools or roads there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I think it's the tragic faith that makes Home Guards such heroes for us, the Slovene fascists. If you like them you're basically 80% redpilled. Slovenia never had anything to be really proud of from fascist perpective, partisan bolshevik struggle against Nazis awakened the untermensch mentality of people under the disguise of patriotism and they're basically like Irish nationalists I was talking about in that other thread yesterday, labeling everyone as a traitor for not following some peasant patriotism. So the horrible massacre of our warriors at the hands of the forces of modernity is the only powerfull story worth mentioning from a fascist perspective.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Overall, it's a good story and myth for a small nation like ours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The only problem is that the regular right is not redpilled enough to recognize that modern West and EU are basically continuation of the same Marxist problem. They also like to play the victim card because they don't realize that Europe doesn't care about White Christian victims. So instead of this cult of victim we're planing to build a cult of revenge. No mercy for marxists and other untermensch degenerates of all sorts, just like they didn't have a shred of mercy for our people.</p>

<p>rough translation of the speech: "we're proud that we ardently love our beautiful homeland, this wonderfull God's garden in the heart of Europe, and we're ready to defend our homeland and our nation from criminal "liberation front" (bolshevik partisans) and its supporters to the last drop of blood, helping the community of European nations, defending Christian Europe. Truth, justice and almighty God are on our side!"</p>
