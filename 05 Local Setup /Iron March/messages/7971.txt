<p>Hey mate- firstly don't worry about long posts, I do them all the time myself and as long as they're worth reading like yours was they don't worry me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Completely agree on your views on the ANM, &amp; came to the same conclusions myself after a lot of thinking. I have no intention of involving myself in terrorism (hi, ASIO) but when we're under attack from all angles as we are now, with such basic uncontrontoversial things as national pride vilified as political incorrectness, some people will feel violence is the only option left open to them and I do sympathise with both that desperation and their feelings that it's the only option left open to them to create change. When we're completely shut out of parliamentary politics as we have been, the system brings this desperation on itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Personally what I admire best about the ANM is both their Australianisation of NS as well as their propaganda campaign, which has been hugely underappreciated. They SWAMPED the entirety of Perth in posters for years, it got everyone talking honestly about multiculturalism and even non-Nazis were speaking favourably of them and their message (or so I've heard from family members etc.). <a href="http://aso.gov.au/titles/documentaries/nazi-supergrass/clip3/" rel="external nofollow">Both that</a> and the <a href="http://aso.gov.au/titles/documentaries/nazi-supergrass/clip2/" rel="external nofollow">questionable terrorism</a> prompted copycat behaviour and got plenty of Asians to fuck off home too. Noone else has ever been that ballsy or had that big an impact, except One Nation shills &amp; maybe Aussie NA. You're right, they're the closest we've got to a Rockwell group- though Rockwell was a lot sharper than Jack, if I'm being honest. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>In terms of the Henry Lawson/Old Labour-style nationalism, Australia First seem to be doing that and I think ideologically and intellectually there's nothing to criticise. Also sympathise a bit with Saleam's distancing himself from hard radicalism nowadays, presenting a more 'respectable' face, because I personally am on the same page as you- you need multiple aspects to the nationalist scene, from the party playing the parliamentary game to radical street activists like British NA (which we lack unfortunately). I have reservations about Saleam as an organiser though, he's been at this game for 40 years and has produced a lot of bright ideas/observations but made fuck-all headway anywhere else. It's whats put me off joining Australia First- that and being in the public service, I'd lose my job, but I'll have to make sacrifices like that eventually.</p>

<p>Sounds hard as shit being on the mines mate, but you must be earning decent coin I bet. Glad to hear you're working with white guys too, I've met a lot of Irish heading into the country to work those jobs. As for the book- I checked, and the public libraries seem to have gotten rid of their copies (they do this regularly, it's not necessarily political). Only a few uni libraries hold it. You can buy it <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=12265208642&amp;searchurl=tn%3Danm+story" rel="external nofollow">here</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ANM-Story-Jack-van-Tongeren/dp/0646499041/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417522948&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+ANM+Story" rel="external nofollow">here</a>, but I imagine it'd cost you at least $60 &amp; I'm always happy to lend you mine (so long as I get it back lol).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyway I think I've written more than you by now, this must be a cunt to read so I'll head off, cheers.</p>
