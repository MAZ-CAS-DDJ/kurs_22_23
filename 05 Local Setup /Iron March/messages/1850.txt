<p>Short answer, no you will not have any problems from publishers.</p>
<p>If you are an academic author or you are published as such you basically lend your work to be a public service on some level. Nobody's work is protected the same way the twilight books are because they are an educational discourse which is why academic works can be freely distributed. It is only the publisher want their pound of flesh, but even then it depends on the publisher, the author, and in any case if you are not making money off it they can't do shit. How do you think a university is able to operate when it has all the work put up for the students.</p>
<p>Publishers don't appear to have cottoned on to this whole internet file sharing thing, have you ever heard of anybody other than a major record label challeng a website? So far though we have been sticking to back end nazi publishers like stevenbooks, and their own situation is so dubious they don't touch us with a 10 foot pole.</p>
