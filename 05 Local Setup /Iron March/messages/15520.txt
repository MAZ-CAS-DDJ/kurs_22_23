	I wouldn't know anything about the Moklowski surname. The best thing to do is to ask your older relatives if they have any documents on it. My family was lucky enough to keep hundred year old documents safe, so I know my own family history pretty well. Turns out I have Ukrainian/Russian ancestry lol. I completely encourage you to visit Poland, because you well be treated extremely well. Poles have not forget the good deeds :)

	And I will answer some of your questions you asked in the thread.

	So "my group" is in the sandbox phase. But I am organizing a legitimate (and legal) Paramilitary/Defense force. I currently live in the United States so I will be serving in the Marine Corps (inb4 serving Israel). My other friends who live in Poland are going into the Straz Graniczna (Border Guard). This is all for the experience and training. I plan to only include Poles and Polish diaspora with ex-military service. The prime function of the group serves to not only assemble an elite force of veterans, but to train our brothers in defense, survival, firearm use, and other skills. I think the best thing to to is to train Polish men to defend their God, women, children, blood, and soil.

	I came to this forum to find allies with people who seem like they have a world view. It seems like I find many decent people. So far I have come in contact with Falanga members, Serbs, Romanians, and a Hungarian (You), haha.<br />
	But there is also a mix of garbage on this forum. Self-proclaimed "National Socialists" who are degenerates baring a false label. There are a lot of drug addicts, non-whites, apostates, and faggots on this forum, so its good to find true friends in the midst of all the bullshit.

	When are you going to Poland? I return next summer, so if you want to meet up with me and some friends, you're invited for some beer and a fashy camping trip hahaha. I want to assemble potential future allies who are fighting the same struggle, so it would be nice to hear some good ideas in person. Hope to hear back, God Bless.
