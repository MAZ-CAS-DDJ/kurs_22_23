			Yes, I just read an article here about the ideology of Ernst Niekisch and it's much better than what I expected it to be. First I thought he is just an other Strasser or something. Nonetheless, most IM members are skeptic about Russia, and I have to tell you that today it is obvious for me that back then my views on Russia were overly idealistic. As far as I know they have the same shitty demographics (or worse?) and Putin is almost the same as Orbán; a simple Pragmatist. That's still better than the Satanist Westerners though.

	I believe the demographic picture of Russia is changing for the better. You have to give it to them, they are pushing the ban of abortion.

			I totally support that, but this goes against what you have said earlier, and I really can't see how are you going to take it back. You have the power, but Geopolitics is another question. Btw, I thought that today's Macedonians are more closer to Bulgarians. What is your stance on that? I know that Macedonia was ruled by both Serbia and Bulgaria after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, but I read somewhere that their language is almost the same as Bulgarian.

	I'm not contradicting myself, no idea what you're on about. <br />
	I really don't know who was the wise guy who said Bulgarians and Macedonians have the same language. Yes, there is a great deal of influence of Bulgarian among macedonians because at the time they financed schools and books in Bulgarian, but still Serbs understand Macedonians better than Bulgarians and vise versa. Bulgarians already have their own chunk of Macedonian Region, Greeks too, only Serbs were deprived of their claim to it, especially the one where are ethnic Serbs, now renamed as Macedonians.<br />

	Yes, those who live is Serbian living space. I don't count in possible migration. Ofc there are former Dalmatians now living in Zagreb etc. But that number is prolly tiny and insignificant.

	New Byzantium is Russia, Third and final Rome. If God wills it and Russia spreads its wings, we will be under her protection and part of restored Christendom.
