	I'm right near Fort McCoy. I think it's like an hour and a half from here to Madison, according to Maps anyways. I'm not picky at all as far as food. I'm on a budget between buying a vehicle and recently moving and all so preferably a cheaper place if possible. But yeah that'd be great, meeting halfway is a good compromise.
