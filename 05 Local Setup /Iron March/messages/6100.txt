<p>I don't consider myself as white or european either, though I have nothing to prove to one such as you.</p>
<p>We Turanoids have many heroes and many great conquests to look up to. What has Hungary as a "european kingdom" to look up to, other than being the buffer zone of the west? They used you and now they abuse you even further. Instead of being proud conquerors, like your ancestor Attila, you try to be a servant to the west. Why don't you hop on to our side and join in for the big win? If not, stay out of our way.</p>
