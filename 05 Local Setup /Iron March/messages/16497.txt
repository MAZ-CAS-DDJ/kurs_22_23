	Lol you remind me of this other Flip fascist I met long ago. He hated Christianity and thought we should become pagans. <br />
	I think Christianity was the best thing to come out of our colonialism, elevated us beyond spear chucking savages, also traditional Philippine religions actually allowed tranies and there wasn't any cool stuff like throwing homos into the bog. <br />
	tbh Japanese annexation would have been best thing for us instead of liberation.
