	Did you look at my thread in the actual slightest? I posted numerous quotes from Allah and messengers deviate from the Universal Truth, from the preaching against racism, to espousing egalitarianism, to finally hating Tribalism. Why should we allow them within this movement? I specifically "targeted" AtomWaffen because they are the only group that I know of that has any Muslims at all. I fail to see any one else every talking about this issue either. Muslims can't be Fascists plan and simple, read my post again specifically the part in which I quote their holy book.
