	Oh nice! Quite long interview I'll start to read it after I finished the James Mason video I am watching right now.

	I don't know exactly when my sis will go to Algeria, I guess it will be in the next month or so, so please go easy on 'Westerners' that time. :D She will go to a work mission, but since she haven't traveled much in her life (only to Slovakia and Croatia IIRC) this will be quite a tourism for her. She just told me that she have to buy new clothes that cover every part of the body because of the Islamic laws. We don't know what is more in line with Islam, her wearing trousers or a skirt?
