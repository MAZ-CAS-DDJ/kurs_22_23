<p>I've seen how you're ideology is 'Peronism'.</p>
<p>I liked Peron &amp; his wife, but from what I gather there is a lot of confusion surrounding what exactly Peronism is.</p>
<p>Apparently, both the Left &amp; the Right claim to be the rightful ideological successors of Peron's legacy.</p>
<p>I would be very interested in knowing what YOU say Peronism is.</p>
