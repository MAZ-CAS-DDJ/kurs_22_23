<p>man, it is better not to go around pointing fingers at who is to be sterilized anyway, especially among people you can call comrades... it sounds retarded, not to mention disrespectful and unempathic. we simply need to mention that it is a method, that it is immoral is obvious but for the greater good equally obvious... read your edit and it sounds like you are apoligizing for something better left unsaid. ideally this sort of thing would be handled by experts and officers behind closed doors, and to be honest a far greater proportion of the third world is unaryan than first world, it is <em>somewhat</em> linked. obviously everyone will be treated the same, but that will not mean it will yield the same results, if that makes sense. if you can, delete that edit.</p>
