<p>1. I feel rural life is ideal. The architecture of modern buildings is also corrupt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. That sounds like a good idea. A nation should maintain a large population. It would allow ruralism but the nation will not be under populated.</p>

<p>3. I don't think it will be feasible to abolish cities anytime soon. Maybe one day cities will be abolished.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4. State owned farms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5. People will still be trained to do different jobs. I think most people should be employed by the government. Though some private enterprise will be allowed.</p>
