<p>Hey,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That sounds great! Just send me specifications, I'd love to help out. Stenciling is a great tactic and something I like to do often. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am fairly busy but I have enough time to do work, particularly if I could get paid for it, but I wouldn't want to jew out on another nationalist. I hope $5 AUS for each design would be a reasonable price? I will make sure to print it out and test it before sending it off. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Btw you Aussies are one of my favorite peoples on the whole damn planet, every one of you I've ever met is likeable and laid-back but also competent and very masculine. I really hope you are successful, you deserve it!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>E</p>
