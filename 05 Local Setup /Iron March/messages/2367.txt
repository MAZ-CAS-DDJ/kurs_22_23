<p>Sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>I agree about Casa Pound, and I'm very surprised this forum has shown so little interest in them so far.  As I understand it, Riprendersi Tutto / Recovering All is one of their key texts.  They seen to translate nothing into English.</p>

<p>I think even their mayor has undeniable personal ties with the far right of Italy, which I got a chuckle out of the other day.  The son in law of a key 70s terrorist figure or something.</p>
<p>I just registered on Salo as Heiligen, and I'll put those articles on my ereader.</p>
<p>Eurocontinentalism is buried somewhere in my Google Reader account, can't say I've read it in awhile.  You might find some value in www.reddit.com/r/new_right/ , there is a good flow of articles there even if the sidebar makes it a sort of warped promotional page for the user mayonesa, who is also Amerika.org / Brett Stevens / Vijay Prozak, among other identities/pseudonyms.</p>

<p>On the topic of the 'New Right'-- I think its strength is that its solely an intellectual movement and therefore doesn't attract hooligans or those who want to wrap themselves in the fascist aesthetic/mystique.  Then again, its also basically dead.  I keep seeing been on IM here make comments indicating he doesn't have an critical grasp of what the 'New Right' is at its core.  Have you read much about it?  I'd say its a sort of salon for the foundational ideological bedrock of fasicsm.There is one book that sums it all up very well, and can be had for $4 for a digital copy.</p>

<p>Its key weakness is that some of its proponents, at least in North America, still want to discuss aspects of Esoteric Hitlerism and Ariosophy, which would be a severe achilles heel if it ever managed to gain traction.  No to mention, its all nonsense based on my research. </p>
<p>I will give IM credit however for the podcasts, as they are working with primary texts and not discussing complete frivolities such as news.</p>
<p>Lately, in terms of making counter-revolutionary progress in North America, I've been thinking that the modern obsession with 'holistic and organic' consumption/liftstylism needs to be reconnected with Traditionalism.  Of course the American status quo is so thoroughly homogenized and inane that I don't think it will ever be receptive to such ideas again.  I really only see success happening on a secessionist, Nationalist-'Galt's Gulch' level.  I don't necessarily think that the modern technocratic system will fail-- its that reactionary culture will not survive.  </p>
<p>I'm starting to ramble so I'll end it there.</p>
