<p>Sorry i took a while, just been thinking up some questions. I can always add more, but I think this is all the meat.</p>
<p>To start with though I am not sure how you want to introduce yourself,</p>
<p>A rank, a vague job description, your background, your career/where you have been, anything else - obviously how much you say is up to you. I think the questions are mainly innocuous, though you might still enjoy answering them. You dont’ really have to answer all of them I am just sort of prodding areas that are relevant. I am interested in any good stories that highlight your point. I have tried to be intuitive here but if there is any Q&amp;A:</p>
<p>You need to break it up into multiple questions or you want to add that could be in any way relevant</p>
<p>I am happy to modify my part to fit whatever the answers are – this is to compensate for the lack of conversational direction.</p>
<p>Also I am a Brit, notify me of anglicanisms – like ‘serviceman’ and ‘forces’ I don’t know if you use these or not.</p>
<p>{Introduction}</p>
<p>    Hello.  I am conducting this interview using the pseudonym Ferret, as it would be rather unbecoming for my identity to be comprimised in my career field.  I am a platoon leader, 1LT in the United States Army, Air Defense Artillery.  It is a combat arms branch concerned with destroying air and ballistic missile assets.  I grew up in a trailer park in East Texas, I grew up viewing the poverty and hopelessness that a lot of American society faces.  I was for a very long time a rabid Leftist, an opponent of both Christian reactionary thought, and Capitalist exploitation of the lower classes of American society. </p>
<p>    In my teenage years, I was into Punk music.  The violence, the aggression, the energy, it was beautiful, it didn't adhere to the idea that I had to shut up and sit down.  I was vibrant, I resonated energy, I had charisma, it was tapped into by violent aggressive music. </p>
<p>    I was also intelligent and had forsight.  I knew that where I was, a trailer park in the backwater areas of Houston, was not going to get me to any level of success or greatness.  I went without excessive partying, drugs, drinking, all that nonsense, I knew that I had to do well in school and get to the next level.  This I did.  I put myself through University, and although I did my share of partying and drinking, I never lost sight. I couldn't! This wasn't daycare for some spoiled brat, this was my future, and I accomplished my goal of getting a bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>Why did you join the military?</p>
<p>    I joined the military about two months after graduation.  I hated my prospects, this was 2009 and the economy was in the shitter.  I hated that the Financial sector of Wall Street capitalism had destroyed my country, I hated that my chance of success was curtailed because jobs were being shed to stop the economic bleeding caused by billionaires.  At the time I joined, I was working part time at a political phone survey company, and it was an egregious affront on my dignity to be held on the vine.  I was borrowing money from my father, who was also unemployed in this period, I was ashamed of my situation.</p>
<p>    I went to a recruiter, mainly because I felt the military might be able to square me away, and because I wanted the time I spent laboring to mean something.  If you labor your life away for a paycheck, well, I cannot think of a more disgusting and misguided use of your time.  Luckily for me, I scored a 97 on the ASVAB military test, with a 135 GT score and they offered me the oppurtunity to go to Officer Candidate School, in which I passed and got my commission.</p>
<p>What are your general political sympathies/views if you have any?</p>
<p>    I won't say that I read the Fascist Doctrine first, and then adhered myself to the views stated.  I had my views first, which were Leftist, but as time and experience weighed itself on my conscience, I started shifting to the Right.  I'm American, but have little to say to Conservatives, who are usually synonymous (sp?) with Christians, as I am a devout Atheist.  I was a History buff, I have a Bachelors of Science in Political Science, with minors in History and Sociology.  I began my own personal research in the Interwar period, and my sympathy's drastically left the Communist revolutionaries, and became quite sympathetic to the men who fought in the First World War who came to power in their countries to save it from Internationalist Sovietism, the destroyer of civilizations. </p>
<p>    I view myself as a variation of 1920's Italian Fascism.  I view it as a template, to be modified to work within the context of 2010's USA.  Will it be the same? No.  It shouldn't.  I don't even have a completely thought out political process, I just know where I am originating for at this point. </p>
<p>I am not opposed to interventionism in the economy, especially in key industries.  I was only opposed to the bailout of several key Wall Street firms in that I think that they played us like a fiddle, to destroy American families and homes and added nothing to the economy besides easy credit.  Saving American automotive firms, I am not against.  Russia has a policy, in which they control 51% of key industrial firms. They call these "National Champions".  I think most American companies are doing fine and should be left to their own devices to make America great, but if need be, in specific and pragmatic cases, I am not opposed to taking 51% control of key American industrial companies to make sure our national interests are being adhered to.   </p>
<p>Is this an uncommon attitude? Could you illustrate what the outlook of the average servicemen is?</p>
<p>    The average service member, in the year 2012, is against the war in Afghanistan, I work in a training facility.  Our doctrine is unabashedly to make the Afghan political process happy.  The country of Afghanistan is fleecing us.  They are a tribal community, they don't care about the USA, they are the graveyard of empires, they know it, and are proud of it.  They will take whatever we give them and ask for more, as if we owed it to them.  The military objectives of the USA are to destroy the Al-Queada terror network, and to make the government of Afghanistan able to stand on it's own feet. </p>
<p>    This process right now is rife with corruption, and I think it is time to go.  I have nothing benevolent to say about their government, or even the Taliban. I wish we could pile the bodies of Islamic Reactionaries high as a mountain.  But, with Afghanistan and Pakistan eager for us to leave, I don't want to waste anymore blood and treasure on these people.  Every American soldier who is injured defending these barbarians is a tragedy. </p>
<p>    Most American service members support Ron Paul, the Libertarian-leaning candidate of the Republican Party.  I don't, but he is the only one not trying to send us on failing missions which resemble a messy attempt at Imperialism.  I'm not opposed to Imperialism as a doctrine, but the way we go about it now, either declare it as such or go home. We are wasting time, and the lives of the best America has to offer, I find it disgusting.</p>
<p>What changes have occurred in the military since you joined?</p>
<p>    Since I have joined, they have cut Basic Combat Training from 9 weeks to 7.  I disagree with this .  I went through BCT, and it shaped me to be the soldier I am today.  If anything, it ought be longer and tougher.  Soldiers are getting weaker and lazier each class, this is not what the USA needs. We need soldiers that can and will destroy all enemies in close combat, what we have now are Soldiers that need to be re-taught basic Soldiering skills, such as Land Navigation and proficiency with automatic weapons.  I find it very offensive that I have to even teach my new soldiers this, but it has become the norm.</p>
<p>    Also, homosexuality is now allowed in the ranks.  You may be surprised that I do not disagree with this.  The Soldiers already know who is Gay or a Lesbian, this didn't really change our military posture.  Soldiers tend to congregate based on interests, even sexual interests.  It has not changed our mission readiness in any quantifiable way.</p>
<p>What about political correctness, is there much of that in the army? How has it affected things?</p>
<p>It exists on paper, but we don't really adhere to it.  When females are around its obvious we don't use words like "cunt" or "pussy", but they are hardened, they swear and talk just like anyone else. We don't tolerate weaknesses from our females, so far it is working well, at least in my unit. I know it can be problematic in others.</p>
<p>What do you think of the concept of ‘diversity’ in the military? What has this actually meant?</p>
<p>    I really have no opinion on this particular issue.  The military isn't designed to be diverse, but diversity is an inherent aspect of egalitarianism and meritocracy.  Even in World War 1, different demographics were thrown together and became brothers in arms, this helped lead to the Class Collabarist views of many Fascist parties.  I support it.  In my Battery, I have Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, East Asians, all ethnic groups, most religions, and most political stripes.  We come together to further our mission, our values bounce off of each other, it makes the collective stronger.   They are all soldiers at the core, and I would eagerly take a bullet for each of them.</p>
<p>Does the US treat it’s servicemen well, during and after their service?</p>
<p>    The US does, though I will say that it is almost a failure on the part of the Soldier if they do not prosper afterwards.  I can tell you that upwards of six months before a Soldier leaves the service, the military will give him several classes on financial responsibility, social mobility, everything that can be used to make a smooth transition to the civilian world.</p>
<p>    There are many military personnel who do not prosper outside of military life, and although it is a tragedy, many of them simply were not capable of regular life, and that is why they joined the service in the first place.  The biggest regret I have is watching my Soldiers waste their money on consumer goods, and not save it for later.  I can advise them all day long, but it is a personal responsibility to take care of yourself.  The biggest detraction I can have of the military is that the government takes care of us in unprecedented levels, and though we are worked like dogs, it can lead to a welfare mentality.  When many soldiers are pushed back into civilian life, they cannot handle themselves accordingly.  The military is constantly trying to fix this, but it has not been accomplished yet. </p>
<p>What challenges do you face in your day to day the job? Is it all a smooth operation or are there problems? Is there wasted effort/time/resources – or are you lacking in anything? – question applies to any other organisations you have come across by contrast – eg: the Afghan Army, UN peacekeepers, and the wider military.</p>
<p>What is your opinion of the armed forces leadership. Do you think they would make better civic leaders than democratic politicians?</p>
<p>I fully think that military leaders would make better politicians.  I have the lowest regard for members of the bureacracy that create policies that do not benefit the Nation.  Especially those that have ties to private sector companies, who manipulate the endless pages of the Law to make themselves and their friends rich.  They are traitors to our country and should be viewed accordingly.  Not all military leaders are stainless in their integrity, but it is easy to see that a military leader is much more prone to honesty and integrity than a lawyer-turned-lawmaker.  I wish our Colonels and Generals were more prone to politics, though it is almost unbecoming to dirty our hands in such endeavors.</p>
<p>How are armed forces operations affected by human rights legislation and watchdog/media groups?</p>
<p>    We are scrutinized, at every level, every day, in all operations.  It has by default lead to a heightened sense of "Professionalism", which is really a synonym for tightening the Rules of Engagement and making it harder for Soldiers to complete their mission.  There are several ROE policies in place that are disgusting, including many that include letting the Afghan Taliban shoot first before we respond, this even goes towards Taliban snipers. If a sniper is worth his salt, he will get a kill that first shot, and we still have to wait until he fires. </p>
<p>    Loosening ROE will lead to more enemy casualties, though in the defense of those scrutinizing us, may lead to a relaxation of the professionalism of our forces.  In their defense, I will say that Soldiers violating the rules of war should be prosecuted, though I would claim that the rules of war are quite lax, and very few soldiers are violating them in the first place.  Besides, you will be hard pressed to find me sympathizing with enemies that intermingle with the civilian population and do not wear uniforms.  I consider them dogs worthy of hanging.</p>
<p>Where do you see the US in Afghanistan in five years? what would you like to see happen? What do you think of Afghanistan in general?</p>
<p>    Afghanistan is not a nation-state. It shouldn't even have the name Afghanistan, which implies that it is a monogomous group of people.  It is the name of the area between several civilized areas, such as Iran or Pakistan. </p>
<p>    The US in Afghanistan in five years?  We ought be long gone.  Give them 20,000 automatic rifles, let them go.  I would prefer Drone bases in surrounding countries, and a small contingent of Special Forces operatives, over the massive occupancy we currently have.  For what?  Afghan tribal leaders play us as fools, switching between us and Taliban forces, depending on who can give them the most resources. </p>
<p>    I would like to kill all theocratic reactionaries and cover them in pork, but that will never happen.  We cannot forever protect the rights of women and children, and it shouldn't be our job to make sure little school girls can learn to read.  These barbarians will not allow it, we should kill as many as we can in the time frame allowed, aid the Federal Government of Afghanistan as far as a reasonable amount of money and arms goes, and come home. We will never civilize these barbarians. </p>
<p>If you were in charge of US strategic and foreign policy what would you do?</p>
<p>    I would create an international, multi-lateral conclusion to the problems of Cuba and North Korea, two relics of the 20th century.  I want to invade North Korea, with China's blessing, and bring a closure to that autocratic, failure of a regime.  I am currently trying to be stationed in Korea so I could take part in that conflict, should it arise.  Cuba is also ripe for the destruction of Marxism, and I think there would be few, if any repurcussions to the destruction of that regime.  I have no tolerance or love for Marxism, and it should be eradicated to the best of our abilities.</p>
<p>    Other countries, such as China or Russia, should be dealt with on a level playing field.  There are such things as Spheres of Influence, that is Realpolitik, and not going away.  Leave the Americas and Western Europe to us, I care very little if they are holding sway in Kyrgyzstan or Tibet.  Pragmatism should be the mantle of USA and Western foreign policy.  In that sense, we have nothing to gain from creating hostilities over countries that offer us no benefit. </p>
<p>What do you think of military contractors?</p>
<p>[Have you worked with contractors? What do you think of them? – your impression of them as people as an organisation? How do you view the use of contractors by the US armed forces?]</p>
<p>Military contractors are a cancer on the military. They are overpaid, underworked, and generally detract from our mission readiness.  The USA is currently cutting up to 80,000 Soldiers and Marines.  There are easily 80,000 contractors that can be cut first.  Military servicemembers are the absolute cream of the Nation, and should not be cast out so lazy, fat civilians can make more money than the average Captain.  It is disgusting and almost traitorous to allow them to work while casting out Servicemembers.</p>
<p>What is your opinion of politicians and/or ‘politics people’? do you have any experiences with them?</p>
<p>Very little.  I hate them.  I was involved in College politics, I was involved in the political structure that was created to give the students a voice.  It absolutely disgusted me.  I quit when several members were trying to vote themselves a salary.  I stood up, told them the equivalent to them being self-promoting worms, and gave up my resignation.  It made me feel cheapened to be associated with them.  Even at the University level, they were out of touch with their constituents, and selfish promoters masked as egalitarian ideologues.  I spit on that memory. </p>
<p>Is the US military an independent body? Is there lots of politics – or is it all tongue in cheek?</p>
<p>    The military is generall apolitical, in the larger political process. I support this, the alternative is something like Commissars in the Soviet Union.  I find them to be rather disgusting.</p>
<p>    Inside the military, it is incredibly political.  Who do you know? Who did you serve under? Who was your colonel?  This occurs, especially in the officer class, of which I'm part.  I am currently in a rather prestigious unit so I am not too worried about it, though once I transfer in a couple years it will be back into play. I am not opposed to meritocracy, though there is a bit of Nepotism at play.</p>
<p>    Be part of a prestigious military family such as the Abrams or the MacArthurs, you will be almost guaranteed promotion.  I have a Lt Colonel as an uncle, who served in the same unit as I am in now.  I can't say that it is assuring me anything, but I know it helped me get a Commission.  This violates my idea of meritocracy, but I will easily plead guilty to using what few connections I had to achieve my goals.  That is inherently political.</p>
<p>What is your opinion of the United States, what parts of it work and don’t work? Do you still support it? Why?</p>
<p>    The United States of America is still the greatest country in the world.  The end of the Cold War has lead to something of an identity crises in the foreign affairs area.  The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were both voluntary and a show of force and indecisiveness in this new world.  Hopefully the negative and positive lessons learned from both of these conflicts will help resolute the next quarter of the century. </p>
<p>    Socially, the USA is facing various culture wars, with a very Christian Reactionary faction versus a Liberal Capitalist faction.  I oppose both.  I want a slightly socially liberal faction with militant values.  I don't care about the base issues of Homosexuality or Drug use.  I don't think the Drug War has worked.  I want a society who's values abhor drug use.  The use of the government to lock up marijuana users is just using up valuable resources. </p>
<p>    My value system should reflect the military, and it should be pushed onto the populace, but I'm loathe to use a whip and chain to enforce it.  People need to be shown the inherent rationality and goodness of Fascist values, but if not, let the gangrene take hold of them, isolate it from good society and let it collapse on it's own merits. </p>
<p>In what way could the military organ be used for the positive reshaping of American society?</p>
<p>Militarized society leads to self-regulation, self-discipline, and self-reliance. Notice that "Self" is in all of these things.  I lean towards an Authoritarian perspective, but a country will fail without the innate discipline needed to prosper.  My soldiers do not need to be baby-sat, they do the right thing, they stay in good shape, they eat good food, they pursue good interests.  As a society, we need to push the idea of self-reliance, that we are NOT victims.  Victim mentality is destroyed Western Civilization.  The Fascist society that will prosper is the one that does not need whippings and punishments to enact basic social reform. That reform either has to be in place or yearned for by the populace. </p>
<p>Do you recommend a career in the armed forces? Do you have any advice to give?</p>
<p>I do, without hesitation or doubt.  I can assure you, no matter your country of origin, no matter your political affiliation, if you join the Military for any period of time, you will spend the rest of your life reminiscing about it.  You have your entire life to be a nobody, you should spend at least a portion of it serving your country.  Even the lowest Private gets his hand shaken in the Airport, not even the highest Financeer gets that privilige.  There is absolutely nothing more honorable than being a Veteran.</p>
