<p>Yeah.  I was a commie/leftist at one point too.  It just seems like since this TRS, alt-right stuff became popular the iron march views hardened a great deal.  And now I get why.  You're right.  Trying to build as big a tent as possible waters down the message to a point of irrelevant weakness.  You and Zieger have put together the most coherent and concise message that hits at the root of the issues we face.  I've been trying to funnel them here with "A Squire's Trial" and "Next Leap" and some of them dig it but most of them won't let go of basic bitch burgerland shit, namely libertarianism.  Not to mention the complete apathy about faggotry.  I can understand why they prioritize mass immigration over it but to pretend it doesn't matter while they're simultaneously horrified by it is a big problem.  And their acceptance of MGTOW, PUA shit is really inexcusable too.  And they may tell you they don't condone it but they sure as fuck don't reject it either.  </p>

<p>But yeah, you're doing it right fam.  Don't slacken, tire, etc, etc. . .</p>
