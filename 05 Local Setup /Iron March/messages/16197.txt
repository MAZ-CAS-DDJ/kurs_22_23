	Yeah, that's right.Â

	That's great to hear. Unfortunately, I don't know enough people in Brisbane yet, and our stance is that we can't set up an official chapter until we've met the person and can vouch for them. This won't stop us from putting you into contact with any that come our way also from Brisbane, though.

	Thank you for the offer; that might be needed at some point. We've already sunk a decent sum in, and it will only go up from there.

	There are a few things that you could potentially do, though, varying in difficulty. We have a discord for the org, where we talk about ideas as well as shitposting (both are pretty important). We would like people to shill for the organisation in general, but be pretty discrete of course, just where you normally hang out (on twitter or whatever). And finally the main thing we need is a graphic designer. We can use non Australians, but I am a nationalist, after all. If you are one, know one, or can learn to be one, please let me know.
