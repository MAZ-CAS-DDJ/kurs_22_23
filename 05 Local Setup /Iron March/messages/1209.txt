<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">I know how you feel about the racism thing. That's the one thing that's bothering me about this forum. I think the moderators should just kick them off the forum, the National Capitalist thing seems more like a troll deal than anything else. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:'times new roman', times, serif;">As for Saddam Hussein, I like his philosophy but the Al-Anfal Campaign makes me very uncomfortable. </span></span><span style="font-size:14px;">Still, I would rather live in Iraq under Hussein than live in New York under Obama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"> totally agree with the right vs. left political idea also. It seems inherently flawed considering how difficult it is to place Juche, Stalinism or even right wing socialism on the paradigm. The only replacement I've heard of yet though is the National Anarchist decentralization vs. centralization. </span></p>
