<p>That's a really interesting way of looking at the gods, and settles my doubts (as well as making me remember the psych reading list I have for some point in the future *screams eternally*). I've never been to the East Coast, but I guess New England isn't called New England for nothing. It would be a crime not to see it at some point, but a lot of my family's in Chicago, so that's a bit out of the way.</p>

Wait, are you learning proto-Germanic? More power to you. All the words ending in 'az' frighten me somewhat. Yeah, I've heard Dutch described as sounding like hissing cats, and that description isn't without its merits, imo. Heh, and guess there are few cures better than excess. Same experience killed my mum's residual fondness for fast food. Absolutely. It's amazing how much many modern traditions, superstitions, etc. are modified customs dating back who knows how long, although harvest offerings unite all agricultural people, so Thanksgiving could be more of a farmer thing than a Saxon thing.</p>

Aw, I'm sorry. Are you at university? I'm reading Mein Kampf, and continue to be astounded by the clarity of the arguments, especially the ones regarding the collapse of Austria-Hungary. What do you think of it? And Agrippa? What of his are you reading? Well that's certainly an omen if ever there was one- no escaping the gods.</p>

Nope. I used to be blonde when I was very young, but it's gone dark brown over the years. What's your colouring like?</p>
