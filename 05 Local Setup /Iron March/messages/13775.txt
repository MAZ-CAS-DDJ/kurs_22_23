	There were only two of us at the time of the stickering. I've talked to Weisse. He didn't give anyone any of my information. I believe him. He may have converted to Islam but we were on good terms. <br /><br />
	It seems that this person may be bluffing, as you originally thought. There weren't three of us, and Weisse didn't give out info. I can't imagine they actually managed to dox me from this account. <br /><br />
	I have skype. But I'm trying not to use it. Weisse told me to delete all of my messages.
