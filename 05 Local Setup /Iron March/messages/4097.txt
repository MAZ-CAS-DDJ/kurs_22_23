I belonged to a few minor Nationalist groups, membering a dozen or so members, but it never went anywhere. They never did anything but sit around and talking shit about various minority groups, which is hardly Problem Number 1, as far as I'm concerned. I tried actually making a difference, no matter how little, but they had lazy streaks that wouldn't end. I started a small group myself, we distributed propaganda, patrolled our neighborhood at night, did community service, and became somewhat notorious in our city, making the newspaper on three occasions. Eventually however, their lack of commitment, not to mention severe ideological differences, led to our 'group' having myself as its sole member.</div></blockquote>
<p>Okay you are not entirely 'new' but I did not imply any insult with that connotation at all; I have much the same experience, which ended in the same result but I would not call myself a 'veteran'; there are extremely few people on this forum who have meaningful experience which can be helpful. talk to Ritz, Ben, Blackshirt, British Union or Orange Jews for help if you want someone that's real experienced. It is much easier to contact them through skype, so if you add me I can give you their contact.</p>

<p>Internet forums will always be filled with, for the most part, losers. It is the masses of these losers that matter the most tho</p>

<p>alright, if you are ever in Philadelphia hmu, or if you have any other questions. My advice primarily (I think that's what you asked for) is what I already said; 1 learn to organize and 2 treat it as if it is a social activity until there is a level of trust and resources to enact some sort of overriding structure and discipline.</p>

<p>It can be, people already see politics as a stale and negative exercize and kids don't like to play with people who constantly tell them 'you're going to die unless you listen to my potion'; and that is basically what our position narrows down to if you take it too seriously.</p>
