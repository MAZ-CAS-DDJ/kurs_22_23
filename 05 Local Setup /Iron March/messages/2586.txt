<p>Ah, I see. Baader and Meinhof were geniuses in many departments then. I was just curious what you meant.</p>
<p>Also, what do you think of the European archeological discussion about the Indo European and/or Proto European identity of Europe?</p>
<p>Are you familiar with Marija Gimbutas or <em>Die Ethnogenese der europ√§ischen Indogermanen</em>? Or <em>The Kurgan culture and the Indo-Europeanization of Europe.</em></p>
<p>They study what European culture was like before the Indo Europeans/Aryans came from Russia/Black Sea.</p>
<p>The two theories are Europeans were conquered, or the two melded.</p>
<p>In some Norse cultures, it is pointed out both culturally European and culturally Aryan elements. And except Estonian (or Finnish), European languages are Indo European.</p>
<p>What is your opinion on Proto vs. Indo European values? (As opposed to Proto or Indo European genetic mix).</p>
