	What's your proof?<br />
	Edgy posts on Ironmarch?<br />
	Also which wackos?<br />
	McVeigh? Brevik?<br />
	They might be wackos but shit they get stuff done and have contributed to the movement in some way.<br />
	Oakleaf I don't understand why you're so uncomfortable with a few autists.<br />
	I mean during my time as a 4channer I realized places like this attract that sort of crowd, its a given. If  there was any other fascist site than Ironmarch either it's very kosher "pls don't hate us we're not Nazis" types or the sort that attracts weirdos. <br />
	I think the problem is that Ironmarch is probably the only fascist outlet you have, in fact this is my problem too. <br /><abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> posters are some of the chillest people on this site. We don't have any fascist social life outside this forum and that isn't very healthy. <br />
