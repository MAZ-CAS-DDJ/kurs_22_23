	Laptops and gaming usually don't go the best together. No problem if you do it just to blow some steam, just don't go all neckbeard with it and play for many hours every day like people tend to do with MMOs. If you could get some local fascists to hang with and do fascist pranks with that'd be great for blowing steam. Not always the easiest however.

	Speaking of reading, I saw that you read Patriotism by Yukio Mishima and I just read it last night. It was amazing. Do you have any of his other books? I'm waiting on a few to arrive and then I'll have 7 or so to read through. Too many books tbh.
