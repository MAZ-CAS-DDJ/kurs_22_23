	Alright thanks. So, when you worship the gods do you do anything specific like a certain ritual or way of praying? Could yo use an image or statue like this  <img alt="Thor Statue | Wood Finish | Dryad Design | Norse God Pagan Asatru Viking Wicca" src="http://thumbs.ebaystatic.com/images/g/mvwAAOxyRHdR3CLf/s-l225.jpg" /> as a focus point? Also, what about the ancient Roman deities? PS No I do not own the statue just some pic I found. Might be some wiccian shit though, not sure.
