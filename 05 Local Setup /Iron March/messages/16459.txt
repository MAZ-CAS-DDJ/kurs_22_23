	Hi.<br /><br />
	Interesting question - a lot of people asossiate Ataka with any far-right movement and they are partially right. The partially part is that Ataka used to be an active far-right party  until 2012, I would say. Until they backed up pro-turkish controlled government for the sake of 'stability'. This was pure treason, especially when there was a document that the turkish party (DPS/ДПС) financed them and paid a lot of money for that. After that the party is nearly marginal - they tried to go more socialistic and took ultra-prorussian policy and they are at arround ~ 3 and 5 % . They were going really well and then money happened. The other nationalistic parties are kinda kosher - we have NFSB (National Front for Bulgaria's Salvation) which are pure clowns imo, but they have some influence near the Black Sea. They have their own media and they put based materials but there was a scandal with gay porn on their channel after 00:00 and in my opinion those guys are phonies. Then we have VMRO-BND (as VMRO - the macedonian organisation that was active in 20th century). They are the guys I will vote for. Their leader is fat pig ex-DS (National Security - repressive organ of the communist party) but his vice-chairman Djambazki is based guy and I have hopes for them. They don't have anything in common with the authenthic Internal Macedonian Revolutional Organisation (VMRO) but their politics are adequate, they have some based people but they prefer the legal way of fighting. There are things I don't fully agree with them - particularly with Karakachanov (the leader) but hopefully he will retire and Djambazki will get in charge. <br />
	Since we have presidental elections in Sunday, those 3 parties united themselves and put a common candidates for president and vice. They formed so called Patriotic Front and put Karakachanov for president. This is kinda weird since Volen Siderov from Ataka and Karakachanov used to hate each other A LOT in the past. Like they were about to fight once. But politicians are whores so I am not that surprised.<br />
	I still vote for VMRO but I don't have hopes that things will get better via politics and stuff. We need chaos, chaos and more chaos. Otherwise ZOG won't simply allow a nationalist party in charge, let alone fascist.

	Noteable based non-political organisations are Blood and Honor Bulgaria, National Ressistance, Bulgarian National Union. Sad part is, Siderov has leadership qualities but what he did can not be forgotten. Another example of how money corrupts is the ex-leader of BNU - in the 00's BNU was very strong far-right organisation until its leader Rasate fucked things up, there were money scandals and the organisation is extremely weak now. Same thing happened to Siderov and his party.
