<p>Ok. But I can't see the Chinese joining forces with the Japanese. The Chinese government pretends to be communist and promotes their historical version of Japanese atrocities of what happened in WW2. I could not see why Japan would even be interested with having an alliance with shit countries like Vietnam and Cambodia. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore a good countries but countries like Thailand are full of fail.</p>
