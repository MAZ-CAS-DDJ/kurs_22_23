	Hello!
</p>

<p>
	The situation in Poland is much calmer than in the last years. The Independence Day last year was very peaceful, except for one minor incident where a small group of anarchists tried to disrupt the march, but failed miserably. Therefore, I'd be very happy to invite you this year.

	Anti-germanism is not as present as it used to be. In fact, a lot of Polish and German nationalists are trying to reconcile and work together.

<p>
	Cheers!
