<p>Hey Slavros Plowshares here. sorry I haven't been around at all - life has been absurdly busy and I've been doing too much offline stuff to really stay active on forums much. I still keep in touch with Kacen, KU and a few others though, and have had a few IRL adventures with current/former IM members, and some hilariously dangerous fasc mishaps. Other than that I've been trying to keep a low online profile due to some of the scrutiny I'm under, which I hope you can understand.</p>
<p>If I may make one request though, would it be possible for you to make another edit in this old Tumblr post (yeah I know I asked you to edit it a while back, but a couple things got missed): <a href="http://slavros.tumblr.com/post/81576632559/american-futurism" rel="external nofollow">http://slavros.tumblr.com/post/81576632559/american-futurism</a></p>
<p>If you scroll down to where the words "Richmond" and, later, "art school" are said, could you remove/substitute those words? </p>
<p>Thanks for your time, and I hope things have been going well </p>
