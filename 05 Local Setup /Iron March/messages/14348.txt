	Not really, my mom was angry that I was loyal to my dad, that i was seeing him so much, that i refused to go along with the abuse narrative. She tried telling me I needed counseling, so I could "understand how he manipulated us". This went on for a while, she was very passive aggressive and eventually told me i was disrupting the families healing process and asked me to go. I asked for 24 hours, bought a car, and hit the road. It was scary but it was a big adventure and it's during that time I fell in love with my fiancé. I don't regret anything i did. Eventually she turned my siblings against my father, they saw him twice the year before he died, and maybe seven times the year before that.

	My dad shied away from racism, but he hated islam and deep down i know that if he knew what I knew, he would understand.
