<p>How are you, old friend?</p>
<p>Sometime after march I am going to go to Europe.</p>
<p>But many things have changed since I last mentioned it years ago. Over time I began to appreciate russian music and culture, which is why I will also at some point be visiting your country.</p>
<p>I have lived a very simple life all these years to finish my studies and then accumulate a bit of money. Soon, it will be time it pays off. At some point, maybe our paths can cross for a drink (although I seem to remember you do not drink) and for some casual trotscum bashing.</p>
<p>At the same time, I'm wondering how difficult it might be to get some kind of quick language course over there. I've picked up bits of russian language, but just enough to get by as a tourist minding his own business. Maybe I could even get a job so I could stick around for some time before wandering for whatever destination may come next; I don't know how feasible that is, but if analphabet niggers manage it, I suppose it can't be too hard, and maybe you would be able to point me in the right direction. Or not. Do not feel that you have to "do shit" for me. I am, after all, largely a stranger.</p>
<p>I am leaving everything behind as I always spoke of. My ultimate goal is to settle in some country in Europe, but I don't particularly care which yet because it is hard to have an opinion about something you have never seen. Argentina sickens me and I cannot stomach lingering here for much longer.</p>
<p>I bet you never imagined that somebody like me would come to appreciate Russia. But there it is. I hope I don't have to go through poland to get there though, because that would be disgusting, but oh well.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Take care</p>
