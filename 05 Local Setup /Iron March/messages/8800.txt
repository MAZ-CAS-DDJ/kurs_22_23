<p>Yeah, I understand, and thanks. Everyone keeps saying there are other fish... Hah! Stupid advice. You know, I was talking with my friend's boyfriend about this, and he said "You know, I hate this advice, but there are plently of other fish in the sea. And you know... (he winks) fishing is pretty damn fun." I don't think I've ever felt so different from somebody. It was a very weird moment.<br /><br />Post me the funny parts, I could use a laugh <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> I watched this, I like it. Once I get my stupid tablet fixed I will probably wacth it at nights. I was needing something new to watch, serial killer documentaries get old XD<br /><br />Oh my goodness, they made another...
