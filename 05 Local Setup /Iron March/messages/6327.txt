<p>Questions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Do you feel that village life (i.e. farming towns/communities) is superior to city life? If so, do you feel that it is equal to rural life, or do you feel there is nothing greater than rural life? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. Do you feel that there is a way, or possibly one day will be a way, to successfully merge city and rural life? Possibly in the form of "large villages" if you will? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. Do you feel there should be "no" cities or just a very small number of cities? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>4. As far as farming goes, do you feel every person should grow their own food, or should they all participate in state-owned farming jobs, where everyone participates in growing a certain portion of the food which will be shared among the community (Kind of like what Pol-Pot did)? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>5. How would certain necessary jobs be done (i.e. factor jobs) if everyone lives a rural lifestyle?</p>
