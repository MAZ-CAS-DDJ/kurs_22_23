<p>Welcome to the IronMarch, GWO! I was wondering whether to direct you here, but I figured that, due to your spate of inactivity on NS, you were busy anyway. But you're here, and of that I'm glad. If only I could get Panzerjaeger to come back...</p>

<p>Thanks, comrade. I recently purchased Garry's Mod and I've also been working on a production in RL. There's nothing like coming home after portraying a d-bag "I hate niggers/EVERYTHING" U.S. Marshal in Tennessee to a battle between endless waves of Combine and the US Marine Corps...</p>
