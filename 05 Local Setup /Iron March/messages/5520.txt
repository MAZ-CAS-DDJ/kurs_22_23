<p>Something doesn't smell right over what happened. How is a page taken over and yet a warning can be sent from that page that it's been hacked. There was also a post by the NBU page this morning which at the time I thought was asinine so I left a critical comment and the next thing I know they take the post off. Something funny is going on. Maybe Gary is putting trust into some bad people.</p>
