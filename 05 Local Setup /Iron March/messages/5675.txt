<p>I sent a message a while ago informing you about a book I found about Oswald Spengler written by a man named John Farrenkopf. Just to let you know in case you haven't read it yet, I created a topic with several links to a summary of the book, a review of it, and a short essay on Spengler's third volume.</p>
