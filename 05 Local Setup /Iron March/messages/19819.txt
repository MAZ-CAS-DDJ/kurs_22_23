	<strong><em>&gt;Unfortunately. I want to mend the divide and I do my best to bring reason from the "pagan" side but I don't think it's going to be possible to really get everyone on the same page. The only reason I'm responding is to attempt to educate you a bit about what non-Christians actually believe, because evidently you don't know as much as you think you do.</em></strong>

<p>
	<strong><em>&gt;You make a lot of poor assumptions based on little to no evidence.</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
	Because I have never heard of a Pagan belief system that has anything of more value than a shit tier, imperfect pantheon. I have seen no evidence that any Pagan religion understands God as a literally all-powerful and perfect personal God. The Nordic or Greek pantheons for example are nothing more than "super heroes" as Florian Geyer once put it. He was exactly correct. They are not by any means perfect or all powerful. Worshiping those pantheons is the equivalent of worshiping an Emperor. They worship the creat<strong><em>ed</em> </strong>rather than a creat<em><strong>or </strong></em>because the gods are bound by many of the same limitations as mankind, and are imperfect in the exact same ways. In the case of esoteric Hitlerists, they worship a literal man. The fact that they think he is not a man is irrelevant, because in actual objective fact, Hitler was imperfect. So that's where I am coming from when I say Paganism is atheistic, because I don't know of any who at least outwardly display anything different than what I just stated. I don't claim to know a lot about Paganism, which is why I specifically point out when I am making an assumption. I am just responding to what I see from the people I interact with who are Pagans and what they say.

	<strong><em>&gt;They could have and they did.</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
	See, I don't know about that because out of all the Pagan religions I have heard of, none of them have. I can't think of a single Pagan religion or esoteric system that has made it clear to me that it worships anything more than something imperfect. Like Hitler or Odin. If you know of one then tell me and I would be happy to give it credit for that. Of course in the end no religion is complete without the Logos of Christ, but as we know that requires a leap of faith and cannot be rationally argued between us.

	<strong><em>&gt;The full truth can be found in many religions and many esoteric practices from many parts of the earth.</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong><em>&gt;It's possible to get Divine Revelation from other places than Christianity.</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong><em>&gt;God can't be fully understood by human reason but His Laws and the Nature of the Universe can. Divine revelation can be gleaned and has been gleaned by many non-Christian people practicing non-Christian faiths.</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, they all understand parts of the truth. Obviously I still hold that none are complete, and most are no where near without Christ. Even beyond that, its still possible to come to incorrect conclusions about the truth that has nothing to do with the Logos. That's why modern Christians, though they 'believe' in Christ are still fundamentally atheists in the same way that I personally consider Pagans to be. They are wrong about many truths that you don't even need revelation to know.
