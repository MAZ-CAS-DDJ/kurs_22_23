	Hopefully when we're both free we can go do some hiking, fishing or some hunting when we're both down south. Personally I'm a little confused religiously, I was born and raised Roman Catholic, went to a Roman Catholic private school for elementary, went through an atheist phase and now I'm stuck being a sort of cosmotheist/panentheist. I would like to know more about heathenism though so I look forward to what you have to say on that. <br /><br />
	Drunken skin heads are pretty degenerate yeah, useful but still degenerate that's for sure.
