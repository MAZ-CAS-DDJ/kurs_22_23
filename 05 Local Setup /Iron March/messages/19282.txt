	Yup, that's very true about the issue of ideals and methods. It's basically a matter of Lunisolar transcendence: combine the harshest and most Solar ideals with the most flexible and lunar methods, and that's when you achieve the perfect transcendence. Hitler said this too about how the NSDAP was totally rigid and unmovable in its ideals, yet also completely adaptable and open-ended in its tactics. That's all perfectly fine, and in fact that's exactly what we have to do. However, my contention was that Slavros seemed to disagree not just with methods, but also with the core ideal itself. He was using the philosophy of methods to discredit the philosophy of ideals.

	The thing is, there's ultimately only two groups of people: the perfect Aryans, versus the modernist slaves. There's nothing in-between. All cultures and civilizations are ultimately accidental and fake, and most races are too inferior to deserve to exist (blacks, Jews, etc), and ethnicities are only real if they are built on the grounds of the Aryan race (otherwise, they're fake and accidental too). So once again we return to the conclusion of total fascist world conquest, namely by the most perfect Aryan elite with the highest spiritual qualities.
</p>

<p>
	Also, think about it… just, what exactly is Slavros trying to achieve by saying this anyway? How exactly would this view be applied in an actual fascist movement? Would this be a part of the movement's inner doctrine? Would they tacitly acknowledge the idea of a fascist world government but not care about it deep down? Should we just give up and not aim for a fascist world government anyway, just because we're stuck in Time right now? Essentially, here's the problem with Slavros' argument: for some reason, he is trying to discourage the ideal of fascist world conquest. It's this psychological discouragement that is at the core of what he's saying. But the fact of the matter is, actions speak louder than words, and only the most fanatical words lead people into actual action. So if we're not fanatical about the fascist world government (which itself is undeniable esoteric truth), and if we just try to hide it under the carpet for the sake of compromise, then the whole ideal is just going to erode and die out over time, and our movement will ultimately not be in line with Truth in the eye of God. So if we're not fanatical about the ideal of the highest Truth annihilating everything except for itself, which is the core of what the final Apocalypse is all about, then how are we even fascists? Do you see what I mean?

	Well, yeah, isn't that the whole point of quantity vs quality? On one hand we have the endlessly downward and hopelessly unstoppable spiral of Involution, and on the other hand we have the higher spirituality from above which captivates the rare fascists into seeking the highest Truth. Take this fact to its final limit, and you have one conclusion: masses of manimals on one side vs perfect Aryans on the other. And since all the civilizations and cultures are fake accidents anyway, we're bound to be left with this final scenario of manimals vs Aryans, which is the only true essence of what's been happening all along. (Basically, <u><em>the purpose of our existence is to try to accelerate the coming of the Apocalypse</em></u><em>—</em>that's the whole point of what I'm trying to say here.) And isn't that what you were always saying too, or am I misunderstanding you?

<p>
	Yup, that's true, but we still have to be fanatical about this goal, since it is literally the culmination of the entire fascist worldview. Slavros, however, is trying to discourage this fanaticism and keep it down. That's the problem here.

	Yeah, I realized I phrased that sentence badly after I had sent it. I wanted to quickly reiterate how at the end God will manifest Himself fully with all of His qualities (i.e. the Last One who will be the perfect unity of the sharpest opposites, Sun and Lightning, etc, standard stuff), but I messed up the phrasing, and that's why the sentence seems to contradict itself.
