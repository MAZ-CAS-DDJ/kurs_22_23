<p>Hey Kamerad, I thought about the article and ways to improve it.</p>
<p>What do you think about this:</p>
<p>How about you describe the contrast between the "feral children", the products of the degeneration on the one hand, and the personification of the "cowboy romanticism", the traditional ideal on the other? I believe that when you put emphasis on this difference, you'll be able to give the reader a well-founded argument for your view.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
