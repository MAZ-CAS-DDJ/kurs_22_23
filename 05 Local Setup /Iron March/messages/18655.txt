	I wouldn't say its a "better" chance, but most of the jobs in the USMC are combat oriented or related. Also for the Army, they determine your job before you even take the ASVAB, which doesn't make sense to me. If you want to be a grunt, you have a far better chance getting 0300 in the Marine Corps.Â
