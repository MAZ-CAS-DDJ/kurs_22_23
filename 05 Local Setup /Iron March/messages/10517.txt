<p>yes there was also a clothing store named hitler in Gujarat. And I do but not as much as other people I dont really gravitate towards a fully national socialist way of thinking. It doesn't seem like something that I could implement in the subcontinent without getting a massive headache since akhand bharat is too racially diverse and thats even if you do get the chance to deport all the jews, persians and armenians.. Also that I myself am not not even indo aryan which makes up like 72% of the population.<img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8QceMS-1Ako/U9Pi6URY6-I/AAAAAAAAFhs/unUGihXreI0/s1600/Akhand+Bharat.jpg" alt="Akhand+Bharat.jpg" /></p>
