<p>Whaat? How do you start a movement without recruiting anyone? Did they learn anything from being in contact with Casa? I'm disappointed, I liked their style and their logo is pretty badass.</p>

<p>And blurring faces for Jared Taylor... I saw him speak a while back, he's not much more offensive to the liberal sensibility than your average Republican bible thumper, possibly less so because he's so soft spoken. I didn't like him one bit.</p>

<p>If fascists making a list of their names shut them down I don't think they were much of a scene. You should have a good time then. Here I would be worried, there is no "antifa" per se but the far left is large and well organized as Maryland is a university state.</p>

<p>Keep me updated on this group you're planning.</p>
