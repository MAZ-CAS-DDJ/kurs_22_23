	I like the characters who are the leaders of UPF and a handful of people who like the page who are clever. I can tell the leaders know about Jews by the way they talk without them admitting it.

	I just feel that the UPF is more a youth movement. Which is good. We need something for the youth.

	But nothing has been said on there that I dont already know. So I dont follow the page. I check it every month or so and leave a rare comment mostly for the followers to read.

	I am also not big on the anti-islam thing either. As back in 2012 I moderated several anti islam groups. I made my own group too. But then when I found out about the Jewish Question I was so suprised I was not really into that stance anymore.

	I know Blair and UPF use an existing issue to get followers but I already am aware of the issues so I don't need to follow it as a member.

	The logo and rise without fear thing agitates me haha. I think its childish. It its good for the disenfranchised youth. And a good place to meet like minded folk too.
