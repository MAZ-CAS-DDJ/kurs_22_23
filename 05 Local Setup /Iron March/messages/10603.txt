<p>Hey i saw you mentioning youd like to digitize The Divine and the Decay.  If you're interested, its not hard to build a book scanner, especially if you are planning to do more than this book.  The biggest expense is a cheap digital camera to take pictures of the pages.  It will take some research though.  And a bit of time for post-processing, especially if you convert the images to text with OCR.</p>
