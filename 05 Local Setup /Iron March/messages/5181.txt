<p>Yeah you spoke about my grammar and spelling, I shot back. Again, <em>tu quoque</em> you infantile bitch. Doesn't undermine the fact that I gave you solid criticism which contradicted your original stance, namely, that you are a hypocrite.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>'nowhur a hypocrite' - this was always my stance, if you actually had the ability to read what I wrote, instead of stabbing at straw men.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your entire issue with me is mainly based upon the fact that you can't but join the crowd, being an intellectual child and unable to read into what I am actually saying and instead devolving into calling me 'autistic.' I'd like to see your credentials for even being able to make that claim with a straight face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If anything your insistence of playing the fallacy would imply that you're a little assburg, whilst I am actually capable of carrying a debate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From what I've gleaned from this confrontation is a ) you're a follower of fools, b ) you're a hypocrite and c ) you're not a fascist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hell I'd say 90% of the people here aren't fascists.</p>
