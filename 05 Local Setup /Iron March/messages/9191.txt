<p>Sadly, I haven't. I had a good buddy who went to Ethiopia and he liked it a lot and said that the poverty in Ethiopia is very different than the poverty in places like India. For instance, in India you can see people so poor you assume they will not live to see the new year, and they are visibly destroyed. But while in Ethiopia there is poverty, of course, the people generally look healthy. </p>
