	I know you are involvedÂ in activism in Spain so I thought maybe you might know something.

	Do you know of any Fascist/NS movements in South America? More specifically Argentina and Chile? I believe you are a part of Hogar Social Madrid right? Does HSM have any contacts there?

	If you know of any groups of movements I'd like to know. If you have actual contacts like emails that would be great too. Thank you.
