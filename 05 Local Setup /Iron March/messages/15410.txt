	The book sounds pretty interesting. Should be a good read.

	In regards to the old republic, I actually bought the collectors edition for it, played the beta and played for about a year from launch. Was in one of the top guilds and one of the top players in that guild since I kinda sperged out then. That was when I was still 17 or 18 I think so I had plenty of time on my hands in high school and I didn't do a lot of good with it honestly. Was a lot of fun being a jew in it, as me and another mate constantly crashed the economy and were in the top 1% of wealth in the game. The devs actually introduced an event to get rid of our money since we were so disproportionately wealthy.

	Of course the offer still stands, I'm not going to write a big summary or review on it, just say whether it was good or not. As I haven't been on meds ever it's hard for me to say, but just keep a healthy body and healthy mind. Keep up with exercise, try to be social and keep on reading here and there. Social interaction helps a lot with keeping people healthy. That doesn't mean you have to be going out every day of course, but you should just try to be sociable when at work etc. You don't have to apologise to me for "putting up" with you. You're a mate in the struggle and we've gotta look out for each other.
