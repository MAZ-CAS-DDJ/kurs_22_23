I've always personally believed the Ukraine to be separate from Russia(for very obvious reasons..I don't even see how you can even call the Western parts of the Ukraine, Russian.) &amp; personally held Russia to be one of the biggest problems of Europa. Needs to be shrunk. That may be my Germanic blood screaming out at me - but it's how I feel.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Many Ukrainians from the east and the south are totally brainwashed by muscovite lies, it's just sad. They need to be thoroughly re-educated, otherwise they will be like a 5th column. I am glad to hear that you support our independence and self-determination. And of course I completely agree with you regarding russia - its size needs to be reduced drastically, in an ideal case it would even cease to exist. Russia is a pain in the ass of two races and countless nations on two continents. Its bloated existence spanning from Europe to Asia is completely unacceptable to anyone native to these areas.</p>
