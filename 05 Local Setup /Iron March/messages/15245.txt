	Yeah that user actually contacted me a while ago to tell some information on you to "expose" you and get you banned, but it all seemed like irrelevant dirty laundry, I only checked around to see if it was more malicious attacks like what happened with colonel, but doesn't check out.

	Banning doesn't seem like a smart idea as it only attracts more attention to it, but she doesn't seem to actually post anything however. My suggestion would be just to ignore it. If she tries to post anything publicly it'll warrant an immediate ban for stirring up drama.
