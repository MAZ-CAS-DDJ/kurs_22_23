<p>Philosophy, under the best circumstances, is an important aspect of an ideology. Without being a philosopher first and a politician after, you cannot truly inseminate the seed of a a national rebirth as most users seem to believe. This being my personal opinion, of course.</p>
<p>Another aspect of their views I have come across is their purely organic ideology. I believe that a purely organic ideology is not feasible, just as a purely synthetic one is not. Synthesis between the two is required. 'Flesh' and 'Iron' so to speak. They seem to be too idealistic.</p>
<p>But the statement which I truly find absurd is that of the importance of Human life, compromises in order for the few to survive and be brought to 'our' level. The need of the few should never come before the needs of the many. Weakness only breeds degeneration. Extreme collectivism should always be at the foundations of an ideology.</p>
<p>I understand what you meant by the requirement of self-imposed concessions, but Iron March seems to have the utmost potential for a Fascist forum.</p>
