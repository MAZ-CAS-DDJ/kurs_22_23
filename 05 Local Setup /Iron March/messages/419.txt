<p>Hello, and thanks again for posting in my introduction thread.  As a fellow ethnonationalist, I figured I would pick your brain a bit.  What form does Finnish ethnonationalism take?  I have read that there is resentment towards Swedes since Finns hoping to attend university must learn Swedish and the Swedes ruled Finland for hundreds of years.  Is this true?</p>
<p>How much of a stigma (if any) is attached to anti-Russian sentiments in Finland due to Finland's vulnerability to Russia?  </p>
<p>Also (and I'll end it here so as to not overwhelm you), what kind of solidarity do Finnish ethnonationalists feel for other Finno-Uralic peoples?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,</p>
