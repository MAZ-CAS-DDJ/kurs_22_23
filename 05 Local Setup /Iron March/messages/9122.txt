<p>Hello,</p>
<p>could you, please, explain how did I trigger all that negative reaction?</p>
<p>yeah, I know I haven't been visiting forums for a long time. Need to acclimatize</p>

<p>Well, you are standing out, my friend. Your intro topic, your avatar, all seem to stand out. You get unnecessary attention towards yourself just by these.</p>
<p>You also caused a small stir in the fascism topic, which was about, as the title implied, definitions and theory, rather than real world applications and presence, which is discussed somewhere else.</p>
<p>Though you haven't been put into the showers yet still, that's a good start. And people here are slow to trust people, as this is the internet, and we cannot be completely sure of the intentions of the person before us. Is he roleplaying? Is he trying to provoke us to make a point?</p>
<p>We've had a range of such people in the past, so we're naturally somewhat suspicious of newcomers who stand out as you do.</p>
