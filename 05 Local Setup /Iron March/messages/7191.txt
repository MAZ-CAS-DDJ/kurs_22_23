<p>What do you mean by that. I think Nordic alliance is a good idea, i think it has always been a dream that we could have united north but problem comes from our cultural differences, as you propably know we Finns are nothing like you Swedes,Norwegians or Danish, all of these three basically speak the common language. Not saying that they are the same but very similiar when compared.</p>
