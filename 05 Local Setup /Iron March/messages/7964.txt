<p>sorry, I barely come on here anymore!</p>
<p>When I was still competing in powerlifting, my all time total was 1240 lbs. But in the last couple years I have been training in and competing in weightlifting, so I am sure my power total would be much less now haha.</p>
<p>How about you?</p>

<p>No problem, just neat to talk to another powerlifter. My total right now is 1278 lbs. I'm gaining weight though, so I think I'll be making some nice gains soon. Still sub-junior, first junior year in 2015.Â </p>
<p>How's your weightlifting going? What are your snatch and C&amp;J?</p>
