<p>Well, I could say its a childhood influence to my current character. While other kids were reading books such as the Hobbit(no pun intended,) I was dwelling into H.P. Lovecraft. My father was also quite the fan of the Alien franchise, so I had contact with it at a young age too.</p>
<p>I still have my soft spot for high fantasy, but I prefer Lovecraftian themes.</p>
