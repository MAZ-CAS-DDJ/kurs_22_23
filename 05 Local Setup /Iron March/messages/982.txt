The wife and I have considered moving to savanah or Jacksonville! Both want to live by the ocean, and Oklahoma isn't too great for that.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>I've been through Oklahoma in my travels so I know how landlocked the place is. Savanah is a pretty place but too filled with liberal college kid pinkos for my likes. Jacksonville has a lot of 'groids but there are some mighty fine areas along side the coast line area. I dont mind being landlocked too much so long as there are some montains to hike on through or some game in the area to hunt -and as long as it ain't up North or in the freaky deaky West! I wish you and your wife the best of look. Feel free to write any time.</p>
