	I use memrise (free), and I know others that also prefer memrise. I chose memrise over duolingo.

	But it would benefit you to, on the side, do some general writing exercises. You might also be able to find some random Italians online that would be willing to do some general correspondence with you after you've done memrise for like 4-5 months and are very comfortable with the basics of it. That would be my recommendation.
