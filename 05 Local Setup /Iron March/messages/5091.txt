<p>I appreciate that you consider me a to-go person for such an issue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Indeed, this is quite a complicated thing. Euro-mixes don't normally have much of an issue, since most of the Pagan gods have a counterpart found in other European religions, due to ultimately stemming from the same Indo-European core. So if you were, for example, Celtic and something else like Germanic it'd be easier. But we're dealing with two completely different stems.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Obviously all religions which have a monotheistic core don't really have this problem, since it's all universalist anyways...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I were in your position this is what I'd do:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the things about true polytheistic religions is that they're not always necessarily mutually excluding. That's how a bunch of Europeans converted into Christianity; they just figured "Well, I'll worship Jesus in addition to all of these other guys, extra protection can't hurt." - and the rest is history.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What this means for you is that if you research into both sides of your blood and the associated religions as well as general world view, you may or may not find things that are compatible, to try to make sense of it. At the same time, you may feel that certain Gods are more relevant to you than others. Then you can pick the Gods that serve you best, as odd as it might seem. This was very common for this or that one profession or context.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Long story short, if you research you can relate to several entities and build your own thing, so long as it's not forbidden to do so by one of the religions. The most important thing to keep in mind is to avoid contradictions. Contradictions are a plague. You wouldn't worship two Gods opposed to one another, for example. Well, this should be common sense, but it sometimes is not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's the little things that matter the most. Don't let religion be a bunch of rituals. The rituals are just old methods for arriving to what religions are meant to be: A way of understanding the universe, the forces that govern it, and a way of life. It's like philosophy and ideology's grandfather.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just find whatever "speaks" the most to you, I suppose.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope that's helpful.</p>
