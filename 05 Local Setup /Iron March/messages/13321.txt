	I picked a spot by the river in the woods, formed runes around a rocky area in between, and set a pyre. There was a lot of screaming and chanting, and then I wrote Odal on an altar in mead and ash.<br /><br />
	Well man you know how my life is going. I had originally intended to slit my throat, which I discovered doesn't really kill someone immediately. Blood loss causes people to pass out but the actual action doesn't kill someone for at least a few minutes. Although, growling inside of my car struggling to stop bleeding and survive made me realize two important things.<br /><br />
	One, I'm a fucking survivor.<br />
	Two, Everything that has happened in the last six months. My family, this bitch doing this shit, Joey blowing his brains out, my girlfriend, my other friends, everything has gone to shit and I'm still alive. There is nothing to keep me from going on with what I can really achieve and contribute to Fascism. So I plan to do just that. Keep going, and keep on saluting.
