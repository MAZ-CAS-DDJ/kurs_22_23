	So you can look at it from a few ways, and it's up to you to choose your path but the one thing I always consider and reconsider is: Is what I'm doing the thing I can to do best further the cause? Is there something I can do that will be better for the cause compared to now?

	That's something to always keep in mind. I don't like your chances in academia. That said, getting a masters or a PHD isn't too bad of an idea if you're keen for that. I certainly am not, but in my field those mean nothing next to actual results to me. At the very least you can always write books even without teaching in a professor role. In academia you need to moderate your message. That is not something a fascist should or can do.
