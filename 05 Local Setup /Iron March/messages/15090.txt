	Italy _can_ be very expensive. But if you do it when you're young you can make use of hostels which will dramatically cut back on the cost.... The two locations you want to go to are a little bit closer to Florence than to Rome; Rome has a gypsy problem and can be a very hectic city, but I am guessing it could be a little cheaper than Florence. Florence is a lot of people's favorite city to visit because the amount of art, cathedrals, etc. is pretty amazing. You could do these cheaply if you used hostels or unimpressive hotels.

	At places frequented by foreigners there will be people with generally working English. But if you are outside of a place with tourists you might get a staff that doesn't speak English well and might mess up an order -- this becomes a bigger deal if you are in a group of like 9 people, right, but if it is just you you can be more clear and things are less likely to get messe dup. I imagine if you were in those smaller towns it could be harder -- and learning Italian isn't a bad idea at all.

	Italian grammar is difficult, so I hear, with a lot of conjugations. But there is a huge amount of vocabulary overlap. I think even if you just got to some very basic level Italian you would get by well. Honestly, get an app like Memrise &amp; 3-4 months of Italian study and you could probably get good enough so the trip wouldn't be bad.

	Here's a real big suggestion... If you are going to get a college degree and are a native English speaker or something, you can go get a job teaching English in Hungary or Poland (they generally have openings, it seems). Then you can be right in Europe and just do a vacation over there for a much cheaper cost. I know some guys who have taught in Europe and it seems like Hungary &amp; Poland are reliable places, and while you can find jobs in Russia I hear that there can be problems.
