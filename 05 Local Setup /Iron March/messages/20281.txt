	hey kid what the fuck are you doing? I am just going to assume you went completely loco and leave it at that. Did you know that the sentance for promoting a proscribed organisation is up to 10 years in prison and a 5k fine, I am not saying that is what you just did, but the law can be very broad in it's interpretion. I am going to ask you nicely please please don't even consider fucking around. No, 10 years is not quite a death sentance but basically robs you of the best part of your life, it sickens me to my stomach that this could ever happen to anyone, seriously stay on the correct side of the law. Journalists and Jewish activists watch this forum like the liability it is and they will not hesitate to file police reports, they dish them out like candy. Please be careful my dude.
