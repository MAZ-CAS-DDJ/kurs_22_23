<p>Yes I am ethnically Russian, sadly my parents never taught me so I have been teaching myself since I was 11. Being 17 now I couldve mastered it but I need to find a good Russian English dictionary and just memorize the words. I can read Cyrillic and even Славрос was somewhat impressed haha.</p>

<p>it is a beautiful language and I'm glad your studying it.</p>
