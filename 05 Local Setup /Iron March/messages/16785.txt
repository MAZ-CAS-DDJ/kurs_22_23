	I had those exact thoughts too.<br />
	Like. <br />
	What if I was still in America when the race war happened, as an obvious non-white what would I do? I mean of course I'd fight, but I won't be at all bothered if I end up dying, because I've accepted that providence has made its judgement. <br />
	Same thing here.<br />
	I mean why did Fascism not triumph in WWII if it was the truth? There has to be a reason to it.<br />
	I was actually turned off by Ironmarch when I saw posts celebrating Anders.<br />
	But I realized the media sort of are to blame for Anders and Colombine being so big. Also watching that recent gay Christian movie about the first victim made me lose sympathy for the victims. <br />
	Whenever I think like this I also realize that instead of thinking.<br />
	"That kid could have been a fascist or potential fascist."<br />
	I started thinking.<br />
	"That kid could have been a communist/faggot/fedora/mouthbreather/lemming." <br />
	Whats the chances that the victims of such mindless attacks aren't just normies and would just end up growing to be normies?<br />
	You lived in a negrofied area right? Colombine happened in an almost white state. It's surprising how often few of the whites living in those states are fascist.<br />
	Most of the American fascists have been exposed to the corruption of the system or live in the most negrofied areas. <br />
	I don't really think it's wrong for you to be concerned about the mental state of the people going here.<br />
	I myself am worried that I'm getting more estranged with my family, especially since my sisters are starting to become more "Americanized"<br />
	It's just I find it weird that you're considering taking a break from Ironmarch because of it since I've always assumed it's been a staple of this site since it's creation.
