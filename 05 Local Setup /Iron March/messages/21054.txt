	Heres what I wanted to find out. The Traditional principles are;<br />
	Justice, Hierarchy, Functional Classes, the primacy of the political element over the social and economic elements, the mutual beneficial allegiance between religion/spiritual order with the political order, and the mergence between the warrior and the priestly class. This basically takes everything we know of and have talked about in the forum &amp; what Evola spoke of. Of course there's more to it then that but I'd say that's the foundation. The authority, legitimacy &amp; sovereignty principles have their own aspects that need to be better defined but it will refer to the universal order.
