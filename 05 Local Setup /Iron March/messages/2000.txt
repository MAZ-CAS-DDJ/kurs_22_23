<p>I read too heavily into science fiction as a kid. For me, I am a globalist because my primary goal for the future of man is the colonization of space. I only see this happening as one unified entity, and the only system that has the ability to rule the world strong enough and to stand on a universal level is technocratic fascism. This is a big turning off for most. However I understand that I will never see something like this in my time, which is why trying to shape my country is far more important. But in the grand scheme I want to see one global world under iron rule.</p>
