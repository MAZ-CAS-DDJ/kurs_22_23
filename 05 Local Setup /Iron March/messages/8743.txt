<p>Woah really? Do you type all this on your phone? I don't have a facebook. I've been proudly trying to avoid being one of those dirty modern people with social networking sites for years. Well actually I do, I created a fake account with nothing in it just so I could message my ex while she was at work cause' her work involved her being on facebook. Anyway, wanna share those? Instant messaging is pretty nifty.</p>
