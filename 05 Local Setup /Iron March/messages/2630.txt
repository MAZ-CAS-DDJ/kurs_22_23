<p>I'm planning on turning over the front lawn where I grew up, 1) because I still end up mowing it for my mom, and 2) because the "weeds"(literally, every part of a dandelion's edible and delicious) are the only useful parts, and they get stomped out. That is, assuming I can be the one to ignore the fine, assuming it is illegal in my town, not have it put on her.</p>
<p>And, yes, that's why I was thinking about it. We could always bash illegals heads in, and, as sure as it would be to make headlines, it wouldn't do us any service. Being productive and proactive will, at the very least, give us a much better image.</p>
<p>I also sent this to American Blackshirt. Has he been on, or did I type it in wrong? My thought here is that, while isolated incidents or groups has some impact, the wider we spread this net, the more fish we catch.</p>
