<p>Interesting. I used to go to poole functions (trained with USMC for two years) so the physical part shouldn't be hard. I think the test you're thinking of, the "Palikkatesti" is called the "beep test" in English. Where you run 20 meters to one line, then you hear a beep and run back until you get to a certain level or can't run anymore?</p>

<p>Do they still take people who are wanted outside of the EU? I have heard people say they won't accept you if you are wanted by police anymore. :/</p>
