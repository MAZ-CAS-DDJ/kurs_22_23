	Well I used to not have a bad opinion of it, my attitude towards DS has always been that its a well crafted tool but that Anglin is misusing it, lately though, he made it clear that is not NS and as such won't be using it for NS purposes so I'm personally done with it.

	I hadn't heard of a single DS book club that actually did anything so can't judge (beyond the fact that so far they didn't actually <em>do </em>anything), I imagine there will be wild variations between the different particular clubs depending on its actual makeup. I guess it won't hurt to at least check it out and see if its total shit or not, and maybe if it is totally shit it can still have a few potential NS people attending, so you'll at least network, but as for full commitment - can't give advice one way or another, you'd have to judge for yourself once you actually see wtf is going on.

	And there is some maple group in works but so far they hadn't announced themselves so can't direct you towards anything yet in that regard either.
