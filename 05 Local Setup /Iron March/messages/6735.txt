<p>  As for Christ being white, you actually have a good point with him being the second Adam. Though the issue for me, is that my Traditionalist/Perrenialist ideas lead me to think of Genesis in the context of the other mystery Traditions, so I don't really know how to square Genesis with Ancient Hypoborea.</p>

<p>I'd say that Eden=Hyberborea/Thule, or the land that the Sethites settled near Eden after the Fall and before the Flood. I first wondered about that after reading about Antarctica without the Ice, and Charles Hapgood's theories, which to my mind would mean that the Southern Continent of Antarctica might have been the North before the Cataclysm, and could be Eden/Hyperborea/Thule.</p>
