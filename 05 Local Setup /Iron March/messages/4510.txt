<p>Support of Christians in the middle east would be a big plus, they are the only ones we should help if anybody. Jews are inherently leftist/feminine; they support integration for everybody else but they'll be damned if they have any goddarn niggers move into their neighbourhood with their riced up cars blaring their nigger beats out, it's along the same line with Yids in their entire country. I can't say I blame their racism, but they're passive aggressive and push for everybody else to put up with the shit.</p>
<p>I think the best bet for the US is a revival of the Klan, the disciplined, Christian, quality over quantity, proud where it counts (not egotism) and willing to fight to defend Klan. My heart felt sentiments are on the side of the Southern states. Or a form of Rockwell's national socialism, although it wasn't perfect because national socialism has an inherent flaw - widespread socialism, socialism is a part of life between small groups of people, but it should not be implemented into every aspect of life.</p>
<p>The bible even warns of what would happen if we were to accept integration and stray from God's order. And people say it's an outdated book, lol.</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 28:43-45</p>
