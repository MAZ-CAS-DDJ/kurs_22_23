<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I already had thought of just rolling with it all.</p>
<p>I think the worst part of it all is actually my fathers side handling this. they're jews.</p>
<p>I'm probably already on the track to being disowned by them so its probably best to keep my mouth shut for now</p>
<p>So far I don't think they know my name for ironmarch but my skype, steam, and other stuff got searched so I'm unsure.</p>
<p>I dislike the fact that simply mentioning a piece of our beliefs will get us destroyed, left, disowned, etc.</p>
<p>I would like to see that change one day.</p>
<p>Blut und Ehre.</p>

<p>We have a banner, and a bible verse. Two, actually. Matthew 10:34, and John 15:18.</p>
<p>Our objective truth, the work of God, will be hated by the world. By the falsifiers, by muslims, jews, by false christians, atheists, conservatives, liberals, our friends, our teachers, our colleagues, and even our family. We will be persecuted for doing this work and will be hated, because we are doing the right thing. Because the right thing is objective. To quote Proverbs 26:29, "The righteous detest the wicked; the wicked detest the upright." We are not self-serving, but we are steadfast, honorable, and loyal. To be incorruptible and righteous is to transcend all others and to rise above everyone else. They know we are a danger to their selfishness, to their greed, to their perversions, because we will seek to destroy it. And it is in <em>their</em> nature to infect and corrupt as many as possible. That is their *need* because they do not survive unless everyone else is down at their level. </p>
<p>In a fight that we are losing, it is our duty to remain adherent. As long as we remain adherent, we are still fighting them. There *will* come a time when we will strike them all down and the world will be righteous and just again. </p>
<p>I love my family, my friends. But when the time comes, there will be sides to take. And the Truth transcends all else.</p>
<p> </p>
