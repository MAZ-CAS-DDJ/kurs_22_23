	Oh, not any longer? Yeah I just drifted away from it all. I was running BH in Edmonton, so I still have quite a bit of community here. I just started to get pretty disappointed with the Calgary scene to be entirely honest. My names Bernie, not sure if you know me or not. I never got well acquainted with the Calgary scene outside of Kyle, Lee (goof), Jessie and John when John was still on good terms with Kyle.
