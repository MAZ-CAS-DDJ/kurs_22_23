<p>Compromises will not be made if it includes licking Russkie ass 24/7 and striving for a Russian occupation of Fennoskandia. Emil Hagberg's utterances are not open for interpretation, they were quite fixed. How else are you going to interpret "I would welcome a Russian invasion of Scandinavia and the North"? Which was even quoted and highlighted on the main page and won the unanimous acclaim in the entire comment section, save from Noidberg and Patrik Fridén (who, like Mikael Skillt, has been subjected to a most fierce witch hunt by Nordfront for serving in Azov). There is a steep wall there, which I will not climb. Now they are in Leningrad knitting ties with Hoborussian "Nationalists" and probably trying to receive funding from the Kremlin. Really I understand if FRM is equally against 'Murica and Russia but that's is not the case with the SRM, Nordfront is the home base for pro-Russian and pro-Putin opinion on the nationalist Swedish interwebs. The comments are worse than the Daily Stormer. If you'd have paid attention when on pakkoruotsi class you'd have seen for yourself what kind of pro-Russian shills they are in actuality. But anyway, as Noidberg the homo Swede declined, what would you like to see translated in particular? Hit me with something, and I may translate some of it, sooner or later. </p>
