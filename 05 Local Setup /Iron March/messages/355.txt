<p>Sorry i took a while, just been thinking up some questions. I can always add more, but I think this is all the meat.</p>
<p>To start with though I am not sure how you want to introduce yourself,</p>
<p>A rank, a vague job description, your background, your career/where you have been, anything else - obviously how much you say is up to you. I think the questions are mainly innocuous, though you might still enjoy answering them. You dont’ really have to answer all of them I am just sort of prodding areas that are relevant. I am interested in any good stories that highlight your point. I have tried to be intuitive here but if there is any Q&amp;A:</p>
<p>You need to break it up into multiple questions or you want to add that could be in any way relevant</p>
<p> I am happy to modify my part to fit whatever the answers are – this is to compensate for the lack of conversational direction.</p>
<p>Also I am a Brit, notify me of anglicanisms – like ‘serviceman’ and ‘forces’ I don’t know if you use these or not.</p>
<p>{Introduction}</p>
<p>Why did you join the military?</p>
<p>What are your general political sympathies/views if you have any?</p>
<p>Is this an uncommon attitude? Could you illustrate what the outlook of the average servicemen is?</p>
<p>What changes have occurred in the military since you joined?</p>
<p>What about political correctness, is there much of that in the army? How has it affected things?</p>
<p>What do you think of the concept of ‘diversity’ in the military? What has this actually meant?</p>
<p>Does the US treat it’s servicemen well, during and after their service?</p>
<p>What challenges do you face in your day to day the job? Is it all a smooth operation or are there problems? Is there wasted effort/time/resources – or are you lacking in anything? – question applies to any other organisations you have come across by contrast – eg: the Afghan Army, UN peacekeepers, and the wider military.</p>
<p>What is your opinion of the armed forces leadership. Do you think they would make better civic leaders than democratic politicians?</p>
<p>How are armed forces operations affected by human rights legislation and watchdog/media groups?</p>
<p>Where do you see the US in Afghanistan in five years? what would you like to see happen? What do you think of Afghanistan in general?</p>
<p>If you were in charge of US strategic and foreign policy what would you do?</p>
<p>What do you think of military contractors?</p>
<p>[Have you worked with contractors? What do you think of them? – your impression of them as people as an organisation? How do you view the use of contractors by the US armed forces?]</p>
<p>What is your opinion of politicians and/or ‘politics people’? do you have any experiences with them?</p>
<p>Is the US military an independent body? Is there lots of politics – or is it all tongue in cheek?</p>
<p>What is your opinion of the United States, what parts of it work and don’t work? Do you still support it? Why?</p>
<p>In what way could the military organ be used for the positive reshaping of American society?</p>
<p>Do you recommend a career in the armed forces? Do you have any advice to give?</p>
