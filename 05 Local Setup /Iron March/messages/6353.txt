<p>Yea, I'm having a boy so I can at least miss some of the pitfalls of the American school system, but here we REALLY push the Holocaust. By the time I was your daughters age we had already read two books about the Holocaust(huge mistake on their part, it was the start of my interest into NS. They made the Nazi's seem strong, powerful, and unstoppable, and the kikes weak helpless and frail. Which appeals to a boy more?).</p>

<p>I had some help from Grandmother(who lived under Nazi occupation in France and is can't stomach the Jews), who told me not to trust "6 million".</p>

<p>So basically it's ideal to keep them busy enough to stay out of trouble. That's what I've been intending to do myself. </p>
