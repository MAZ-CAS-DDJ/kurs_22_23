<p>It's an interesting offer, i've been a forum mod before but technical issues and my changing interests conviced me to hang that up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Problem is i don't have a PC right now and either use my phone or Game console to use the web.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I should be getting some money soon but I got a number of things i need to buy, a PC being one of them. But that could take a month or so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So i wouldn't be able to use skype and there might be some functionality problems, if you still need help when i do get my PC or if the tech limits aren't a huge issue then i'd be happy too help.</p>
