	Basically I wasn't fully aware of the situation with the reporter. I thought what was important was that we got our side of the story out, not who got it out. If I knew that I had to specifically I would have(I'm going to be speaking to the reporter in half a hour). Now I want to make sure I do it right. I told him the first time that I was a friend passing on my message so I'll tell him that I wanted to be extra cautious. I'll say the exact same thing as last time(Brandon was stressed and confused, who can think that clearly when 2 friends were murdered.) and then provide him proof of my identity so he can get it published.
