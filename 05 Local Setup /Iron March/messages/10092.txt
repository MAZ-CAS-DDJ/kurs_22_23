<p>And yes, I know the Gauls were much more advanced than previously believed. I think they were as advanced as the Romans and Greeks, possibly even more, but they seemed to be very structurally disorganized. It took Vercingetorix too long to organize against Caesar and that's the main reason they lost, not due to resources or inferior tech. They controlled some of the most fertile land in Europe and Iberia had more gold than anywhere in Europe, Gaul was quite rich in mines as well (this is obviously the reason Caesar invaded as Rome's treasury was going into debt)</p>

<p>Have you examined some of the masonry and statues made by the Gauls before the Romans? It's truly fascinating, they were more skilled than the Romans and in an earlier time period. I've heard theories that the Celts were originally very advanced but some sort of calamity caused their decline over time, however I see no obvious proof for this calamity or decline. But it is curious how such "disorganized barbarians" as the Gauls could produce works like this </p>

<p>We Germans may have been barbarians, and I embrace that title, but the Celts were not. They were violent and not weak-willed, of course, but they were not primitive savages</p>
