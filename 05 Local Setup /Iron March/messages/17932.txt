	Ill be open and honest. My wife and I are seriously looking into making the long term Northwest Migration. However in the meantime I'd like to be involved in Missouri. I'm around the St. Louis area and I'm working on some projects that may be of use to your chapter there. I am also fairly intelligent at keeping my ass and those affiliated with me out of trouble. Can you put me in touch with the proper people or vice versa?
