	I really appreciate the response. Thank you for taking the time. This is all really good advice, I'll be sure to save it for future reference.

<p>
	As an aside, do you have any resources/advice on recruiting? I have a general idea of what to do, but I'd appreciate any extra pointers. I found that recent <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> conference on YT to be really helpful.

<p>
	Again, thanks a lot.
