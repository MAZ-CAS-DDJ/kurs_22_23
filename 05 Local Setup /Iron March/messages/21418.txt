	I dont even consider stickering to be real activism haha. But they used to be really good, almost everyone has been to jail for real types of activism so i still have huge respect for the original guys when i joined, it just isnt the movement of the future, its on its way out. Ive been helping set up a new organization, now its just a matter of boosting their activity, but its very promising.
