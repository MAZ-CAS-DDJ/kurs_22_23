<p>That's perfectly cool dude, we mostly type, we call now and then but it's not a biggie. I have called maybe slightly over twenty times the entire time I've had skype.</p>

<p>Yeah, drop me a message whenever you're ready. Ironmarch is inactive compared to Skype, that's where the community resides and where we shoot the shit and plan...well, whatever we happen to plan at the moment. There's just a slight threshold, that we won't automatically add new users, just to be on the safe side. And avoid retards. But you're a swell guy.</p>
