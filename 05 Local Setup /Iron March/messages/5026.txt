<p>This documentary has its share of Jewish propaganda but it is what convinced me to become a National Socialist. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYug7hTvI-s" rel="external nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYug7hTvI-s</a></p>

<p>Also check out" The Occult History of the Third Reich". It has 4 separate parts. "Adolf Hitler," "Himmler The Mystic", "The Enigma of the Swastika and SS Blood and Soil". Some of the post War NS occult stuff is a bit far out even for me. Miguel Serreno for example.</p>

<p>Most Black Metal bands are not nationalist but I recommended you some pioneers and some of my favourite nationalist bands. If you are not into metal you probably would not like most of this music. Quite a few bands mix Folk music with Metal. Mayhem is not nationalist but they are Black Metal pioneers. Varg played bass in Mayhem before he killed the guitarist in self defence. Bathory is not nationalist but has lyrics about norse mythology and some of his music has an epic and a nationalistic vibe. I think the easiest to get into out of all these bands would be Nokturnal Mortum. They are openly nationalist and play a mix of Black Metal and Folk music. Hate Forest plays really crushing atmospheric pro-Aryan Black Metal that has some Death Metal tendencies. Drudkh have Hate Forest members but they consider themselves an apolitical band. I like all the Darkthrone I have heard but I pretty much just listen to those albums. They have the trademark raw production many Black Metal bands have. I hated that production at first but I grew to love it. Absurd play really low-fi punky Black Metal and are openly nationalist. They pioneered the subgenre, National Socialist Black Metal. Branikald is kinda like early Darkthrone and Burzum. Some of the BlazeBirth Hall bands mix Folk with Black Metal. Branikald is a NS band.</p>
