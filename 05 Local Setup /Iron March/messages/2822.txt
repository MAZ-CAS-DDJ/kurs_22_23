<p>I don't think we're necessarily that far apart. We both agree welfare is not a "right" - the difference is you see it as a privilege that needs to be earned, while I treat it more as a responsibility that comes with requirements. Seems we likely agree those on welfare need to behave sensibly while in tough economic situations. Much though I'd *like* to trust people to behave, I'm not so naive - but if benefits are limited to those who have already shown they have a proper, functioning sense of national duty, I'm satisfied. It's more or less different means to the same end.</p>
<p>I think your approach would probably be more appropriate long-term, once the appropriate sense of personal discipline has been instilled in the mass population, through education, etc. To clarify though, when you say, "we see a Welfare State where in order to even be a part, you must prove your dedication and worth through military service, <strong>and then actively work to improve the State</strong>, and in return your needs are seen to by the State as a whole," is this saying that to receive welfare, you must effectively be a State employee, e.g. on some public works project? I'm not quite sure how that would work, on the basis that there are a limited number of roads or dams to be built.</p>
<p>It will indeed be interesting to see how the entire economy changes in the coming decades. In theory, the advance of technology should mean there is less need for labor, but I think that only applies in terms of physical work. There's more of a shift towards mental work, at least in first world countries, with agriculture, etc. no longer requiring the same huge volume of manpower. Not sure I'd be in favor of a world where work became largely optional: to me, it does have strong benefits, in that work encourages social cohesion and is usually done as part of a larger machine, whether for the state or on a corporate level.</p>
