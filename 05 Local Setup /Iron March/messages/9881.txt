<p>Most whites who live in highly black areas tend to keep the truth to themselves, but even then I'm sure only a small percent are still redpilled. I can't honestly believe that any white could go through all grade schools in ghetto areas and not come out hating niggers, but it happens, a white girl who goes to a black school is pretty much doomed unfortunately. The only survival tactic she will learn is being a coalburner. The only whites around LA who openly display fascist beliefs are the ones even scarier than the niggers. </p>

<p>Its all good we all had a spergy phase, my early pagan years were pretty spergy too. That one picture of the sperdo offering a burger to <strike>Jesus</strike>  Thor is a pretty accurate depiction of that time. I've since refined my beliefs and delved into alot more study about it. You ever look into Roman Paganism much? Not trying to get you to abandon Catholicism, if I were Italian I would probably rather be Catholic than Pagan, and Catholicism has many aesthetic elements of Paganism mixed in anyways. Even as a German I've considered Catholicism a few times but it just doesnt fit with me. </p>

<p>I never really knew what to make of Jews but I did notice from a young age that they have an overwhelming representation in media. As a very small child I figured "oh its because theyre smart so they work to high places". I have a feeling my liberal mom implanted some of that too. I've mostly been a NatSoc but I'm just now reading Mussolini's works and I'm enjoying them quite a bit and realizing how much I owe to il Duce. Mussolini is a much smarter and more well spoken man than I assumed when younger; he's always painted as the brutish stupid sidekick of Hitler. </p>
