<p>I'd say that despite my own mixed background (German, Czech, French, Scots-Irish), I fully support building a new America on the basis of the Old England, because it's here in which that culture which you and I share that 'England' is preserved, not the Norman bastardization of it which is now on life support. 'Great Britain' is doomed, haunted by the Atheists, the Jews and the Islamic hordes. England will remain here, in the Old Confederacy area, and bloom again. I like your 'Third England' ideal, something like the 'Russia the Third Rome' idea which is also worth fighting for. King and Martyr-Confessor Harold Godwinson, pray for us!</p>
