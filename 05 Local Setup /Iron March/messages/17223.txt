	Wow, that escalated quickly. Yeah, most "pagans" I've met are either LARPing about the Gods or are "Agnostic" such as me. I don't mind people that truly believe in the Gods or God. What bothers me is the concept of organized religion, and who organized it and with what purpose. Christianity bothers me because the Holy Texts are all Jewish, even the New Testament, as it was written by Jewish followers of, mainly, Paul the Apostle. I studied it quite a bit, and even if he didn't knowingly set up the Christian dogmas, he influenced all other who listened to him, as he was quite important, and so the bible is not the word of God, but of YHWH. My girlfriend is Lutheran, and I have many close Christian friends (including one of the most intelligent persons I have ever known, a young man that converted to Orthodoxy), but I cannot believe in God or treat the Bible seriously as an "european" thing. If you refuse to acknowledge that the Bible, both New and Old Testament, are a Jewish construct, then you must be mad - but if you truly believe in the 'Christan' God, I will not taunt you or anything.

	About using Heathenism as to only solve social problems, that is quite wrong. Every folk has its own culture and spirituality, and always had, before the main conversion to the Abrahamic faith. I don't agree with modern reconstruction, but something has to be done - I'm not a scholar like Himmler, and I can't trace 'European' faith and neither do I have the intention. I believe that Blood &amp; Honour are the most important thing, and so we must heed to the advice of old tales.

	The problem with Tradition is that it is, most of the times, fabricated. Such as the "Christian" tradition or the Heathen one, or even something that isn't religious, but cultural. Most of the times you can trace it to where it came, but the question stands: how old is the tradition to be genuine? It's a topic that I have researched myself as Historian and dabbling Anthropologist/Sociologist, and it's quite hard to answer that. Some things that seem "genuine", like the Roman salute if you will, should be traceable, eventually, to a point in history where it was first made. Before then they could have used another, who knows!

	Bah, it's turning into mental masturbation. What matters is what is real and True, not what should have been or should be. And we can't know the future. Thus, I strive for betterment each day, even if a little bit, as that is what I see as the ultimate human feeling - find your role, what you were born into, and improve yourself on that.
