<p>That's a nice idea but I don't really have any comrades involved in local nationalist movement let something like national socialism, faschism or specific 'against the modern world ' literature. People here in this part of Europe are more aware of the dangers but surprisngly apathic and lethargic. Also I am helpless when it comes to visual propaganda and photoshop etc. I am more or ress talented writer and my strength would be something that has to do with writing. I've had this idea for long time but I am not sure how to accomplish it alone.</p>
