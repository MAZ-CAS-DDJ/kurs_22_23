<p>Hi, I'm sorry that I didn't reply to you earlier, I had a lot of work. I guess that it's a near future idea, we'll see, it depends when some girl from Bulgaria will arrive here (our friend from NS scene) who tattooes really cheap, it will cost me half the price I'd pay to some local person here.</p>

<p>For me it's necessary to live in a city, otherwise I wouldn't be able to do the things I'm doing. I don't know if I told you, I basically organized some sort of underground boxing club for a couple of our guys and some other people, I'm running it. I arranged the gym for the summer but it has now become a full time thing, I'm really happy to have this sort of thing going and some side activity. Then there are other things I'm doing, but I can't go into details on the internet, this is just the way it is these days unfortunately. Anyway, this fascist life and being part of a crew demands to be present all the time, in touch with people. I also have a lot of obligations for university and a part time job.</p>

<p>I'm actually happy that there's so much to do otherwise I'd probably feel very lonely now that I live alone. Sometimes I feel depressed but it ends quickly because the phone is always ringing and I have to organize things or I'm simply in one of our pubs with other people from the scene.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm really happy about your posts here and I always look forward to what you say. You seem alright, you're hardworking and responsible. It helps to know that there are good people with these views that we have, I hope you stick to them and refine them with experience and knowledge, I've had them for 10 years, I don't even think how my life would be without them, but it really helps when I see comrades who're worthy of respect. It didn't prevent me from being one of the most talented students in my generation and being successful on university so far. I'm telling you this because when I was your age I had some doubts occasionally, a lot of people choose this worldview because of some teenage rebelious attitude and then leave their comrades.</p>
