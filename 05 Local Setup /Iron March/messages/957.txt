<p>Major Tom,</p>
<p>The next issue of Reaktion will not come out for a few months. I need to get off my ass and finishing revamping the articles in all the issues to check for kinks (if you have a pdf editor you can help with that, but I have to ask the others on board what they've done) I would like you to, if it is no problem, do a bit on National Syndicalism. Do whatever is easiest for you though I'd like to see how National Syndicalism, how it benefits the works, how it handles resources, etc. I want to add some variety to the journal and have economics counter-balance the militant social conservatism, I also have a friend who wrote about the true demographic situation of the US... whites will not be the minority for a long time is the gist of it. I figure with things like his article and the one I hope you write I can make the journal look like it can cover a wide range of topics, some of the objectively all for more credibility.</p>
