<p>We took all the kids outside, it was so hot. We had the sprinkle head on the garden hose, and I sprayed it over their heads. Each time the water drops hit them they would laugh and laugh. Then we got to watering can and they helped in the garden, gathered chicken eggs, and we had lunch outside. One of the babies, Charlie, said my name for the first time. I was hold his shoes, I called him over, and he ran to me and said "Emma!" It made me so happy. Can I send you a couple of pictures? <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
