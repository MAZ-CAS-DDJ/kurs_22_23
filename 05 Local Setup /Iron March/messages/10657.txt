<p>Hey, I've just begun reading your book, as I need something for the long train journeys.</p>
<p>Some of your arguments are spot on, and I've used them to effect in the past. These days however I feel no need to convert people using such efforts, as I feel it's a waste of my energy. I find it easy to show people who spend time with me long enough, if I point out the problem on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>However, my main drive is in Natural comparison. Like, it's perfectly normal to accept animals have territory, why are humans different, etc etc</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for the contribution, it's making a great read. You should write more, you're very eloquent</p>
<p>10/10</p>
