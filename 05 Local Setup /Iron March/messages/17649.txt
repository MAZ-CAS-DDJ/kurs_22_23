	Bruh lol I was supposed to be going Helmad but instead our unit got dropped from it even though we were the best in the battalion. My only problem with fuckin with Iran is what Russias takeÂ on it. I didn't not vote for Hillary just to see us back at odds with Russia again. Like I said, I got no problem shootin some Dune jockies but if that's just gonna cause more tensions with Putin it's probably best not to. I joined with the same reasoning. I may or may not look into pmc work after my enlistment, who knows, but at some point I plan on shooting towards a public office seat.
