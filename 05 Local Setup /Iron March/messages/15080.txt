	Simply had enough mate, posters seemed lack any semblance of either comradeship or even common sense. Also the forum was so poorly moderated that sense and sensibility was simply buried beneath tons of shit. I didn't make any big announcement or add to the drama, there were a few people I regarded well &amp; I simply wished them well.
