<p>Italians have fallen far from their Roman days be that from a lack of natural eugenic choices, mixing or stagnating it doesn't matter when they had so much trouble dealing with a bunch of Ethiopians, I can only imagine how embarrassing it'd be if they took on a nation like Nigeria. France's figures have been embarrassing and their "traditional" appreciation for these figures such as Napoleon III is ridiculous. France is a country which is nearly inseparable from a Sub-Saharan country where nearly over 50% of the population carries the sickly sickle cell disease and you see miscegenation all over the place, whenever I've visited there; Paris is the embodiment of tackiness as well, many of the immigrants we get into this country come through from France. I know my nation doesn't do enough to stop it and there's miscegenation here, but nowhere near the same level. Most people are cynical about race-mixing here, everyday people don't agree with them having kids.</p>
<p>It annoys me when people say fascism failed because we lost the war when it achieved more than communism ever has for the greater good, they are ridding on the "victors" coat tails because they know they could not stand alone. Mistakes were made which didn't bide us much time to be as strong as we should have been but that does happen when you're backed into a corner by people who fear to lose their power and influence to a load of people who are now angry at them.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div><p>Russia will never accept western liberal marxist BS but it won't turn to fascism either.</p></div></blockquote>This exactly my opinion on most the middle east, with a possible exception of Iraq or Syria much later down the line. Saddam was the last great figure in that region.<p>I'm not really proud of "British victory" nevermind a Russian victory if I were them. You are correct about the losses too; another important point is the myth of German aviation superiority in the war - this is not the case, Britain was much more advanced yet they received so many casualties. The twin-engine ME110 was a slow flyer able to cruise at a little less than 300mph and was easily outpaced by the RAF's Spitfires. It was also 'sluggish in acceleration and difficult to manoeuvre. On the British side a total surpassing 650 fighter aircraft had been amassed by mid-July, mostly Hurricanes and Spitfires although including nearly 100 of the older types. During that whole year Britain produced 4,238 fighters compared with a derisory 3,000 manufactured by Germany. Compared to the sizes of most other nations armed forces, Germany mobilised just 98 divisions of which only 52 were active (including Austrian divisions). Of the remaining 46 divisions only 10 were fit for action on mobilisation and even in these the bulk of them were raw recruits who had been serving for less than one month. The other 36 divisions consisted mainly of Great War veterans over the age of forty who were unfamiliar with modern weapons and up to date military techniques. I'd say they did pretty well considering all of these facts. Fascists had quality soldiers.</p>
