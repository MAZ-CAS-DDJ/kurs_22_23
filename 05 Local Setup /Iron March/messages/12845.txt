	Ive thought the same thing sometimes, I really wish we knew a bit more about them but oh well. The mystery, it adds suspense! or something. yeah, britian was kinda the thorn that never went away from germany during the war, if it would have been an ally that would have significantly changed things, oh well. america is a lost cause right now, it needs a harsh remaking unfortunately

	yeah, its funny how insecure most of them are. most whites in my area, at least the city ones, are pretty pathetic and hate their own culture most of the time, or consider themseles cultureless. i doubt a chimpout would wake most of them up, but the ones who are awake are more likely to be armed and competent.

	huh, thats interesting. ive heard similiar theories on why dragons are common across cultures, since theyre usually just giant snakes or lizards with wings they represent mans general conflict with poisonous reptiles or crocodiles in the past. not sure, im a bit weirder for it, but this is a weird age. what are your dreams like? when my dreams and paralysis are bad its horrid but I have good dreams too, theyre usually pretty mild and pleasant.

	yeah, they think that means submitting or allowing corruption to happen. natural order is just the  way of things, even the barbarians and those noble native americans had tiered societies. and yeah....i would show you a picture but ill spare you. it looks absolutely stupid. some go all out and wear hats with animal ears too. see, americans have authentic beserks too!

	it was fun for sure.  most skinheads are good guys but dumb as rocks honestly, im not the smartest guy but most skins i met...werent very well educated. alot have their hearts in the right places though and i hope they will be useful when the time comes. got into lots of good fights and scraps, that part was fun. I know fight club sorta connections from it lol. eh just sorta fell out of it, its sorta edgy and childish in alot of areas and there arent too many skins around here anymore. plus i like having slightly longer hair than none lol. im almost sure she did, im not sure how shes actually that stupid if she really believes in that. jews are masters at playing that "am I an idiot or just trolling" game though, maybe she just said it to make me waste time contemplating it for the rest of my life lol. we learned a bunch of bullshit in school but that stood out to me, i dont even remember most of it. i remember one movie we watched about the dresden bombings where the brave american heroes are all "no johnson, dont bomb the schools! we're not like them!" the characters were fictional inserts of course and they avoided the whole burning thousands of people to death part. ive been talking to friends in my area who are germans or irish though, and its surprising the number that are starting to identify with their blood roots. they get angry when I tell them about these sorts of things.

	yeah i guess thats true. i always thought audrey hepburn was really beautiful, if theres a resemblance thats certainly good. ive never really been told i look like anyone, just "german" which im fine with lol. i could show you a picture I guess, I havent shown anyone on IM what I look like yet. might wear a mask
</p>

<p>
	lol sorry but its not mine. he was pretty badass, ive read on a couple of the germanic uprisings and his is definitely the most impressive, the theories that sigurd dragonslayer was based on him are cool too.  what did you learn? to be fair I havent studied him for a while, since high school i think.
</p>

<p>
	oh and im sorry if I cussed earlier, it tends to slip out when im chatting. I dont like cussing when i talk to frauleins haha, its impolite of me.  it just feels natural talking to you i guess
</p>
