<p>NSP,</p>
<p>I was curious if you were the owner of those articles that were posted on "National-Revolutionary Alternative". If so, do I have permission to compile them in video format with music &amp; pictures and upload it to my youtube channel with full credit given to you and your site?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
