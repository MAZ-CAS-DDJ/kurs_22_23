<p>I agree, as usual.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>BTW, I am friends with some Korean skinheads that are far right wingers, racially conscious, etc. Some of them even network with the Japanese SSS. There is a record label / clothing brand that brought over Bound For Glory. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Their symbol these days is a small variant of the Totenkopf and they call themselves "Yellow Side Support." Really, really smart guys who are obsessed with bringing back the honor &amp; that warrior spirit. I am good buddies with these guys and there is even an Austrian White Nationalist skinhead who works for Samsung that regularly comes over each year and they network.  It's worth noting that there is a few other random far right skins that have shown up here over the years.</p>

<p>I agree entirely on the idea of each ethnicity having some fundamentally different social concepts flowing through them, and it might even be a bit different per nation and per region than others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will perhaps start a thread on this later, but one thing fascinating me these days are groups of people that we could refer to as 'peripheral whites.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That is to say: people from Georgia, Armenia, modern day ethnic Greeks, Cypriots, etc. are often significantly darker and have different facial features than nordic &amp; Alpinnian and even typical mediterranean whites. However, they are Christians; we would all say "Yes, OK, Josef Stalin was white..." But, what separates him from a Turk, or an Iranian, or even a Kurd?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He is from a Christian people. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Armenians and Georgians, even the Greeks and Sicilians, fall into the category of 'white' while the Iranians, Kurds, Azeris and Anatolian Turks are not considered white (though sometimes the Iranians are) simply because they are Muslim... I think this is a little dishonest of us; I think that they are, of course, fundamentally individual and do have great differences from us, but they are a peripheral white group. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is not as if they appear as a 'mix' of white and Black, or white and Asian; they're not a mongrelized people. Therefore, they must either be considered an entirely independent race of their own that is neither Caucasoid nor Mongoloid etc., or they are periheral white ethnicities... </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It doesn't mean that they now belong in Europe, nor does it mean that they understand and should be necessarily part of 'White Nationalist' movements by any stretch; I point this out because I think it is important for us to get a grip on things and move away from pure Nordicist views that become extraordinarily exclusive. I also say this because I prefer us to have broad horizons for our upcoming tasks and be willing to cooperate and recognize many people as potentially having good contributions. It is not as if Byzantium, the Ottoman Empire, Persia, etc. are entirely without merit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am also infinitely jealous of the Russians, Georgians, Poles, and especially the Iranians, who have maintained such a cultural primacy in their heritage that they have totally kept out the homosexual &amp; liberal scourge...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was a long message, but I am curious about your response.</p>
