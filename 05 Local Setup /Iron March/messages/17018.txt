	Rockwell get's a lot right but isn't perfect. Mainly disagree with him on religion. I used to be super 1776 into the founding fathers and all that shit, still am from a history lover perspective but the constitution is shit, some parts can be used but at the end of the day democracy will end up the same time and time again
