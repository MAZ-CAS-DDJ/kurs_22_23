	Yeah, some of the people in it are... a bit off. Anti racist kosher nationalists who haven't caught on yet (or even can).

	I don't know about them being aÂ youth movement; the majority of people at rallies and that are over 30. I was actually thinking of starting an actual youth group, but there are a few problems with it I went over in one of the Aussie threads.

	Fair enough not keeping up too much, it's not like I watch their videos. It's quite basic stuff; I just go on their page to keep updated on what they're doing, which is not nearly as much as I'd like. Young Australian men should be out on the streets at least once a week.

	I don't know if I like a few things they do; I especially dislike the hand gesture they use and refuse to do it. It's a Communist gesture. Still, they've achieved far more than I have so I can hardly complain too much.

	Know what you mean on all the rape stuff, I think we're all becoming a bit desensitized to it. This is just how society is now, I guess. It's largely pointless to focus too much on it, unless you're using it for shock value against leftists and moderates. It just makes me upset if I focus on it.

	How old is you kid/kids? Do you have any sort of community so far?
