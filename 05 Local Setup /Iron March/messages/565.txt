This is why I'm a fan of the US Marine Corps. The point is, the brunt of the six years training an officer gets is doing the same thing as that of a soldier: five years are dedicated to basic service. Officer must be a soldier first. The rest that it actually literally takes to become an officer is best employing the skills learned in these five years, plus of course a college degree somewhere. It will take much more than your average joe to pass the officer's trials, which should be very traditional/ritualistic but extremely rigorous and academic as well. However the only officer's training is the year's seclusion from all civilian life. It's only <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>one year</em></span>, a difficult year of course, with a lot of underpinnings or difficulties to get there, much less pass, but purely time wise it isn't that long. And once again, if that one year is too much a sacrifice, then we probably don't need your kind in the officer corps. The job of all this is to dissuade not persuade people from joining the military, so that only the most bold and daring will ever make it.<p>Like I said, there's plenty of thought I put into this <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>Oh yes, that is certainly evident, but I am not sold on the mandatory five years prior service for officers.  I just don't think there is that much to soldiering.  Five years service in peacetime would mean he'd have a knack for service culture, service bureaucracy, and he'd be plenty qualified at his actual job.  I'd say these things are accomplished in boot camp and maybe a year or so of prior service (if that).</p>
<p>Unless you are talking about men joining a unit, serving in it for five years, and then becoming an officer in that unit until they retire.  That would certainly build some monster esprit de corps, but create a rather decentralized service and might open the door to Roman-style military revolts.  </p>

<p>Would the executive take an active part in the promoting of officers or would be it a ceremonial role where the commission is signed by the executive council?</p>

I'm thinking now they will only be spies tasked with delivering information to the police, who would THEN be tasked with resolving whatever issue, and will in fact be the only centralized form of law enforcement since I believe legal matters should be handled strictly locally. Don't get me wrong, there would be intercommunication between regions to effectively deal with inter-state crime, but centralization in this respect breeds corruption of the highest order.<p>Secret police should work as a part of the police, which are part of the municipal government, therefore have autonomy in the central government, (elected by the populace directly) however since they're a centralized utility they should be organized by one department of the centralized government. Which one? I'm not sure, since all of them have more or less equal power.</p>

<p>I like the sound of all of this!  I'd suggest maybe making an office of the Supreme Court responsible for overseeing the local police forces.  This would keep the police force out of the realm of politics and narrow the gap between those that interpret the law and those that enforce it.</p>
