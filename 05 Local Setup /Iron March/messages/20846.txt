Doesn't make sense and borderline calls the nazis liars and hypocrites. Again, the holes in this argument is trying to tie together loosely based theories, and as predicted provides no concrete proof of this and the "supposedly connected" and "believed to be" type comments amount to basically unimportant jack shit.
