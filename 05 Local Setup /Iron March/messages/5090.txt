<p>I'll assume that you are the person to bring this too.</p>
<p>A am a man of Mixed race, White and Mexican, thus i have two lines of ancestry. On my White side i am descended from A common Welsh family whom have resided in Wales for 700 years. I am also descended from a Dutch family, but not much is known from that side.</p>
<p>And of course I am also descended from Mexican family who had resided in a small village in the Yucatan since the days of the Aztec Empire.</p>
<p>This mixed heritage causes an issue for my religious revival. I am seeking to rejoin my ancestor's of my Welsh, probably Gaelic or druidic to an extent, In worshiping and respecting the first gods of this world. But due to my light shade of brown, or mud as its called, i do not know whether or not it would be appropriate to do so.</p>
<p>To give you Information on my current religious ideals: I do not, nor have I ever truly, believe in a single all knowing all omnipotent deity of any Abrahamic religion. I find the notion of the universe and all that dwells with as spiritless mass of existence in which this one deity is in absolute control.</p>
<p>What I feel is that Spirits and Beings of Nature exist all around us. I don't find it as a flight of fancy but rather something i connect with and genuinely appreciate.</p>
<p>I am asking for your advice about how i should proceed with my choices. The reason I am asking you is because you have shown yourself as a person of intelligence and yourself revere the gods of you ancestors. </p>
