<p>Dude, if you survive all of this you will really be taking the redpill. I've seen fucked up shit myself that drove me to basically take my Fascism to heart and push me into Orthodoxy. I actually never even wanted to get violent until about 2 years ago. You're in for a ride. Hold on tight, America is a fucking Babylon, did you know that we've had 20 deaths of adopted children from neglect? Do you realize how many children get adopted by pedophiles in this country? We have murders and rapes so much that no one really seems phased by it and every time I hear my fellow proles talk I am also guaranteed to hear about who's in an abusive relationship, who's addicted to pills, who's a child molester, who's kid is already a convict by 21, it's really sad. Shit, I live in a small town and even here we have homeless on the side of the streets from time to time, even a bit further South in the really small towns you get rapes and hard drugs. Literally nowhere is untouched.<br /> </p>
<p>This is a totally unrelated story but I just remembered it.<br /><br />When I first got into muh Nazisms I had a friend who was a druggie. I remember one time we snuck out and spray painted swastikas on a building, the next day he goes to that store and gets keyboard duster. We go into an alley and he starts huffing the fuck out of it and goes on this long rant about how fucked up his mother was. He then falls down to the ground with a really bizarre smile on his face and his eyes start rolling in the back of his head. All I could do was start kicking the shit out of him and that is probably 1/4 violent incidents I've been with my whole life.<br />A few weeks later he showed up to my house and he had cut his arms open, like not scratches but deep gouges and slashes. I told him to fuck off. I was 13.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> </p>
