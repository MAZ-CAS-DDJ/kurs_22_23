<p>I will sometimes come on here and defend the NBU, but not too much as you'll tend to get a lot of shit over it. You're right though it's very easy to bitch and complain but never do anything about it. There are a few activists here in the forum but everyone else just follows the herd and seek each others approval. It's not easy to form a fascist organization and be out in front about it. Gary has had the guts to do that.</p>
