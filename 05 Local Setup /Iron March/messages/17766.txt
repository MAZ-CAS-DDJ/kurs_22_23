	When you rally people under a common cause it's very easy to steamroll your way to power. Mosley and his blackshirts held the biggest political rallies ever seen in Britain and they achieved that amount of popularity through entirely political and democratic means. He failed to achieve power because the war broke out, not because the methods he was using were wrong.

	In the US we've seen populist candidates like Trump and Sanders hold rallies of 20,000 - 30,000 people and even more in some cases. If they can achieve that, why can't we? I feel that's a much more pragmatic approach rather than assuming some organic state can simply rise out of nothing without popular support.

	We need public support, we need political influence, and once we can see the power we want - then we can seize it.
