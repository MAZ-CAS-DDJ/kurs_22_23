<p>Hello there.</p>
<p>This is a very complicated issue. Basically, Belgium is a rather artificial country made of 2 different regions - and different people - stuck together. While the Flemish part always displayed a very volkisch, nationalistic tendency (hence the very strong nationalist movement Flanders enjoys nowadays), the french-speaking, Walloon part has always been less politically motivated (except for a few exceptions such as LÃ©on Degrelle and his Catholic-traditionalist-fascistic movement REX).</p>
<p>And slowly but surely, laws and regulations were made and separated the entities even further. It started in the 1970's with Belgium being divided by 3 provinces: Wallonia, Flanders and the Eastern Cantons (ethnic Germans), and now we have 3 different governments for the 3 different provinces. We don't have the same laws as our Flemish neighbors...the only thing that keeps Belgium in one piece (but for how long?) is the Royal Family which still enjoys a lot of popularity.</p>
<p>Even nationalist movements in the 30's were separated and reflected the ethnic and sub-national preoccupations of ttheir members, and none of them spoke of Belgian unity. On the Walloon side Degrelle advocated a big country where Wallonia went back to France. On the Flemish side the VERDINASO Fascist movement advocated Flanders' independance.</p>
<p>I would say that Belgian unity has now very little future, and that the 2 national consciences and people are bound to divorce.</p>
<p>Since I'm French and I had a grandfather who was a Fascist independentist member of the VERDINASO, I'd like to see Wallonia back to France.</p>
<p>Just my 2 eurocents on it.</p>
<p>Best, WiB</p>
