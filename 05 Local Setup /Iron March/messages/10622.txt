<p>Well then defend them. it's as simple as that. You seem, or seemed to think that I'm some sort of Slavros fanatic or whatever but he is making the most sense so naturally he is worthy to listen to when it comes to these subjects. You don't make much sense and I'd expect that you would defend the teachings and win if they are more truthful than what Slavros and Zeiger have been saying for a while. If you just run away then it just seems like a semi-autistic new age cult with mild traces of truth.</p>
