<p>Thank you, I just hope I don't get exiled, though the reception has been rather mediocre, but it's better than how some people have been received.<br /><br />Answer 1: I view myself to be a fascist, and I consider National Socialism to be an attraction to fascists, as the majority of the benefits are to the people of the state, thus meaning it's hard to pass in areas mass immigration has effected to the point where immigrants out-number the National citizens of that country/state. Thereby rendering all democratic abilities to remove them, as a democracy would force extreme actions to require a vote, and if they only allow National citizens, there could be riots, hence why I dislike democracy.<br /><br />Answer 2: I am agnostic by choice, I've delved into it a little bit, but I'm no Neo-Nazi, why I do support some of what they did, and I view the idea of worshiping people as Gods for their actions would remove the idea of everything being for the state. In that case however you could glorify the state as being holy and the people as it's pride off-spring. Though that would cause many a war.<br /><br />Answer 3: The Socialist Economic systems of course. Though in this area my knowledge is fairly limited to the types, I believe that National citizens should receive any and all benefits of Economy before immigrants and visitors. If I were to leave my National home of Britain for a Eastern or Western country/province, it would only be on vacation, to see the sights, not to take advantage of the government and state. Which is sadly what's happening to Sweden and why Neo-Nazi parties in Sweden are rising as a result.<br /><br />Anytime, I'm just glad I had someone to have a discussion with. But what about you? If the same questions were reversed, by all means tell me your answers.</p>
