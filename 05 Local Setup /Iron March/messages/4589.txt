<p>Well, sit back and enjoy the ride, and try to come out on top. That is all I can tell you.</p>
<p>If Fascism is not for you, then it is not for you, and you should not try and force it anymore than any other ideology. Approach it with an open mind, as objectively as possible, and give it some serious consideration. Like many, myself included, you may find that it appeals to you not only on a political or economic level, but on a spiritual level, in that is "speaks" to you. Once I let go of the ideas regarding Fascism that had been more or less ground into me over my life, I found Fascism was the most natural thing in the world, and that I could honestly find nothing better, nothing that would benefit me, my family, my nation, or this world, any better than Fascism. Does this mean I agree with every other Fascist on everything? Not at all. But the core Fascist philosophy, that is what holds me.</p>
