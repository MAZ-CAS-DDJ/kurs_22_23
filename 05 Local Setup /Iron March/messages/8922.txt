<p>Alright, nice work. I’ve gone with the top one. Sorry for not getting back to you on here quicker, by the way. Got really distracted with stuff.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over at my end, I’m waiting for circumstances to allow me to start recording the basic techniques of striking (boxing/kickboxing.) Once I’ve got that sorted, I’ll actually have something to give people when they join (I’ve got other basic stuff covered.) That’s the way I’m going to do things. You can’t properly train people up by holding biannual events.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyway, I’ll be at the meet tomorrow. So we can always chat about it then.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cheers Ben.</p>
