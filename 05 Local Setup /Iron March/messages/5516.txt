<p>I have to write a paper for college about the importance of social networking like facebook, blogspot, and twitter in relation to news events. Instead of doing it on something gay and commie like Occupy movement, I was hoping I could do it on something important like the recent events in Greece. As far as I know the mainstream media in greece and abroad are run by the kikes so they report negatively on GD, so GD has to rely on grassroots social media to rally the people, and I am interested in how GD does it and first-hand account would make the essay more relevant and profound. </p>
<p>Would it be  possible to have a chat interview on this subject at  facebook, here or skype? I won't put in anything that you think would compromise GD in any way and you can read the paper before i submit it. </p>
<p>Thank you in advance,</p>
