<p>Frustration with the alt-right's weakness and hypocrisy was a huge factor.</p>
<p>
"I support traditional values!" ... from open and proud degenerates.</p>
<p>
"Something has to be done about our urgent situation!" ... from people not willing to do anything but sign petitions and vote for alternative parties.</p>
<p>
Also lifetime fascination with 'ebul racists and fascists' that I chalked up to historical interest.</p>
<p>
What about you?</p>
