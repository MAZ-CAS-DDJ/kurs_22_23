<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">What we need to do is bring together more people on the British Right like you and me into a small network/informal think-tank. By people like us I mean New Right-types who are bright, insightful, and non-cranky (no conspiracy-theorist types, etc.) There seem to be a few of us dotted about, but we’re intellectually isolated and consequently lacking the influence we need. (I’ve made <em>much</em> better progress networking with similar-minded people in Scandinavia and America, for example.)</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">If we can get a group of us networked together, we can work on fleshing out a worldview (at the same time making room for its variations), whilst brainstorming ideas as to how to best put it into effect in the real world. An ongoing study of social psychology, persuasion, influence, propaganda, etc. wouldn’t go amiss either. Along with some ideas on how best to spread our ideas amongst those of a sympathetic-bent.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">I’ve started (or already made decent progress) on all of the above myself, but it’d be much more effective if carried out by a think-tank type group of similar individuals.</span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">We also need to come up with ideas on the crafting of a genuine rightist counter-culture in this country and/or on the continent, and then put those ideas into effect.</span></span></span></p>
