<p>I am going to be staying in Holland till June/July. I would really appreciate if you introduced me to some people. I live in a shared flat with 3 Surinamese guys, so in my everyday I tend to keep low profile of my views, and I originally singed up for this community for possible conversation on my favorite subject <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> In my everyday i have been surrounded by alco-boozing over-drugged international students, and because of the language barrier i didn't get a chance to meet many Dutch people. </p>

<p>Potentially contacts in Holland are great for future business and political collaborations.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
