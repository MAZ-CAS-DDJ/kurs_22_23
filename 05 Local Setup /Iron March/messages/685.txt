<p>Sorry for the curt reply earlier, I had just woken up and didn't get much sleep. Anyway, may I ask where in the United States you are from? </p>
<p>I know of very few worthwhile organizations here in the USA besides American Front (not the crazy skinhead organization) and Open Revolt and if I am not mistaken they do not exist outside of the internet. </p>
<p>Anyway, I have some more to say about ethnic-nationalism (which might be a good term to replace "white nationalism" by the way). I use to be a white nationalist when I was much younger (I am sure a lot of people here started out as WNs) but have since moved on to more practical ideas. The current "white nationalist" movement here in the United States is very hostile to social-nationalism and conservative revolution to them means nothing more than guys in revolutionary war outfits getting rid of a supposed "red conspiracy" in the white house. I've actually only met a couple guys from Keystone United (KU) that were open to my social ideas but they can't seem to get past the whole "14-88 race war" mumbo jumbo. </p>
<p>It is a tricky moment in time. We do not want to sew discord among those classes which actually have a chance at revolting against this system, but at the same time we want to have some identity beyond just class as well. This is why Marxists have it wrong, and always will. Humans are more than their social class and job. They have ethnic, national, and religious identities as well which Marxist theory discards as unimportant and just a product of the economy. </p>
<p>Back to the point though. A race war is the last thing we need. Not only are whites outnumbered in the world, but they are especially in this continent. Not to mention any whites fighting both a race war and a war against their "race traitor government" would be wiped out completely. We simply do not have the manpower and resources. I also think a race war is entirely unnecessary and obviously runs counter to the idea that all ethnic-groups should have a right to self determination (like whites). </p>
<p>In my opinion, we need to be harnessing the revolutionary potential of the oppressed proletariat in our nations. Whether they be white, black, yellow etc., rather than simply agitating hatred against other races. I believe that if we have a vanguard party of sorts, we can take revolutionary movements back from the Marxists and Internationalists and ensure that the coming revolution and fall of the capitalist system results in a degree of ethnic-self determination and the reaffirmation of identity based on something other than class and the economy. Marxists to this extent are really not even revolutionary, as they are the unwanted offspring of the materialist capitalist thought. A true revolution happens not only on the economic plain but happens on a spiritual one as well, an ideal one, and society is transformed by not just matter (materialist thought) and not just ideals (idealism) but a combination of those which forms the spirit of the revolution. </p>
<p>I am not really sure this helps as to "what we can do". Besides the setting up of a movement to support strikes and other revolutionary activity, as well as spread leaflets on various issues pertaining to whites and the lower classes here in the USA, I believe the best thing to do is organize. Organize, organize, organize. </p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for the rant lol. I am in class with nothing to do and had some thoughts.</p>
