<p>This is really great, I hope you go on having those kinds of successes. If you have a nice circle of people to talk to in your community, that's better than what IM could provide anyway, at least from a support and motivation standpoint. Make sure to solidify this group by organizing activities and get-togethers so that everyone becomes acquainted and closer together. Plus, if you're the one organizing the social life, you'll have a de facto leadership position. Then you can get people on board with projects you might have.</p>

<p>Hope things keep going your way, keep me posted if interesting things happen or if you want my opinion on something.</p>
