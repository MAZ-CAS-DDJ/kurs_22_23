<p>I'm not going to openly debate the adminship in public so I'll send you a message.</p>
<p>You're saying my questioning of the Aussie's economic preference is irrelevant, but the thing is this forum's only screening process is a challenge question.</p>
<p>All I'm doing is asking him those questions to see if he's an actual Fascist or some jackboot asshole kid running around with a swastika tattooed on his chest.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's not my job or place, but fuck it, this forum is too precious to let fucktards in the ranks.</p>
<p>This Aussie can be the next surprise Furry, and nobody wants that.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to start some economic debate, I just want to see where he's coming from.</p>
