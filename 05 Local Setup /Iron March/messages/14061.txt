	Used to be an avid browser of /pol/ on the Chan, back when it was good before they temporarily removed capchas.

	Some fellow Brit advertised the "White Man March" in Newcastle and <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> was attending, that's how I came across them.

	Go on pol daily but it's futile, no where near as good as it used to be. It's just straight up conservatives and other people too weak to underline the *real* problems going on (aside from the occasional NatSoc thread).

	How about you?
