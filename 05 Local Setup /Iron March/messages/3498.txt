<p>I agree with your analysis about Mosley's leadership credentials: a powerful orator, but a thinker and a polemicist rather than a party political leader.</p>
<p>I believe that Hitler 'was right' and he was the best Germany had at the time. I'm fairly dismissive of Conservative Revolutionary attacks on Hitler, though I think some Strasserite criticisms of his collaboration with big business to be legitimate.</p>
<p>An esoteric Hitlerist as fair as I understand it (though I haven't read any of the primary material) is essentially someone who deifies  Hitler, see's him as a God, transcendental figure or reincarnation of some prophetic figure from Hinduism or Christianity. </p>
<p>Just so you're aware, I'm of the younger set and seeing as you mentioned in your introduction being a teenager and growing out of it, a la moving from Mosley Fascism to National Socialism, I can only assume you're older then me. Just so you're aware that any immaturity or discourtesy on my part is due to my age (and that I went out last night and have had only 3 hours sleep <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" />)</p>
