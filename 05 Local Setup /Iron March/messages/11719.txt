<p>Hey Hadit,<br /><br />This is Blackshirt 13 here. I just had a quick question for you. I know that you are a fellow Arditi fan and I was wondering do you think it would be too spergy to get and ware (occasionally) an Arditi pin? Here is what it looks like .</p>

Also, I would probably pin it on the label of my black field- jacket. I like how it has a Fascist aesthetic look to it. Anyways, please let me know if you get this and what you think.<br /><br />Hail,<br /><br />Blackshirt 13<br /><br />PS Sense we have a lot in common do you mind if I add you as a friend?</p>
