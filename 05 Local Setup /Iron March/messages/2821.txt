<p>I have not heard from you in a bit I was wondering if you ever sent off those papers? I just launched a website called www.nsanthology.com and would like to scan the old National Socialist publications on there for all to read. I also have 2 other large projects being announced on November 9th at a rally I am organizing in New Berlin, Wisconsin.</p>
