<p>Fuck, sorry to hear that. I saw you talk about it before but i thought it was in past tense. So it's ongoing huh? Seems strange to me because most of the people i've been close to who've died did it suddenly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm not sure which is worse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It happened a when I was 8 ,so it's not exactly recent.</p>
<p>Was thinking about it past mothers day alot this year for some reason, then her death day.</p>
<p>Sometimes i wonder what she'd think of me or how she thinks of me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What would of been differant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So how about you?</p>
<p> </p>
