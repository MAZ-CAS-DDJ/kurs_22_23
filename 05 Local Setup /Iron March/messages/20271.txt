	Its not difficult for me, i can find them. Here is our problem, i am risking jail as well and making no money on this, in fact with how much it costed me to come here and find what you need i lose 250 euros or so - if you think you can find better prices then be my guest, 600-700 is basically impossible im going to tell you right now, no one is going to sell you, a foreigner one for that much when they can go to western europe and sell it for 3000. It doesnt make sense. So ive told you and you can take it or leave it. I met a new guy today and i will discuss with him and see if i can get anything cheaper, this is in the EU (Croatia) so easier for you as wellÂ
