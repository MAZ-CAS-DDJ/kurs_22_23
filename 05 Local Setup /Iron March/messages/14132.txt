	Hey Xav, I forgot to ask but do you like neofolk and martial industrial music? Also, I just bought Mount &amp; Blade Warband and the Viking Conquest expansion. Most fun I have ever had with a video game. Although, tbh it is definetly a time consumer and I will probably uninstall it so I can focus on my reading,work,Â working out, and Ironmarch.
