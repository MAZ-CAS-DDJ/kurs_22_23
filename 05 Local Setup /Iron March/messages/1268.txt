<p>Along with Benjamin Noyles, Mierce and vlad, you are one of the more intelligent posters here. The rest I've seen so far are intellectualists or childish keyboard commandos.</p>
<p>Even though I take some issues with capitalism here and there and prefer the true traditional Sumerian form of distributism, I can't stand to see the marxist critiques and these victim culture arguments that prevail whenever there is an argument about 'exploitation' and unions. Capitalists are right when they refute the exploitation theory and refute the bullshit of the class conflict stirring unions.</p>
<p>It's great seeing you rip that guy NSP (?) apart. Typical intellectualist retard.</p>
<p>Keep it up.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot Nebuchadnezzar II'. You and the folks I have listed as my friends are the only voices of reason in this joint. We must be mericless in exposing the Red agents like NSP who are trying to pull the wool over our eyes and have people believe that there are no differences between Fascism and Marxism. I have no gripes about original Distributism, it seems OK to me even though I think we need Fascist Capitalism to develop our Nation so we can win out in the struggle for existence, but I don't have anything against the folks who have a warm place in there hearts for *original* Distributism. Its all this neo-Distributism that I hate which is being peddeled by straight out Liberation "theologists" who are peddeling ideas straight out of the old Marxoid/Syndicalist/Socialist playbook like stealing property to turn into *Worker Co-Operative" (worker control of the means of production, as the Communists accurately call it) and preaching hatred and envy of the successful members of society (class warfare as the Reds also call it). *That* I have a big problem with.</p>
<p>Anywhoo, thanks for adding me. I'm proud to call you a comrade in the struggle. Keep giving the Reds on here hell and posting good stuff.</p>
