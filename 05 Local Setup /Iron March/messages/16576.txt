	Yeah I've read all of Varg's books, including his RPG. Got a hardback signed copy of the original release because I'm a nerd.

	There aren't any games I know of that don't butcher paganism in general. I've considered making some of differing genres but never really got around to it since it's a ton of work and I don't have the solid ideas or drive there. The thing about paganism is that you can't really worship it properly. It's never going to return because too much is lost. It's dead. You can study it and have a good idea about it and have a lot of respect about it however.
