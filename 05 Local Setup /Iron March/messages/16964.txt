	I might change some things before I post it tonight. I'll also be sure to make a preface giving context to thread, and linking to the American Futurism thread for the more in depth description of futurism. Feel free to read this at your own leisure, and I'm open to any criticism. Some self-criticism I have is that I feel like I could have done a better job staying on a specific topic as sometimes I feel as if my writing as little all over the place. Thank you.

	<b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<b><u></u></b>


<p style="text-indent:36pt;">
	The Canadian spirit is dead. The Canadian people are weak, morally corrupt, and are void of any national identity. We’re America without the guns, and niggers. “Far-right” individuals struggle to find an identity for themselves to cling on to. Many ignorantly choose to focus on reviving the old identity (that being the British one). If you want to achieve anything as a fascist attempting to use an identity that not only fundamentally goes against everything fascism stands for, but is so far removed from the common knowledge of our people is a waste of time. If the Anglo-Canadian cared for his old identity he would have fought for it decades ago. You would be better off creating a new identity which is exactly what we need to do. Even if we somehow miraculously did revive the British-Canadian identity it would merely be a shallow, unauthentic version of it’s old self, and never truly emulate the atmosphere of the old Canada. This exactly why any Canadian who aspires to call himself a fascist must put his love of his history behind him, and put his focus on the future instead of the past. I myself struggled with this problem, and I hope help you by going over some key points that many self-proclaimed nationalists struggle with. Remember, the blood of the British Isles may run through our veins, but Canada is the only land we shall call home.</p>

	<b><u>Types of Canadian Nationalism</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<b><u></u></b>


<p style="text-indent:36pt;">
	First, we must identify what Canadian nationalism is. Since Canada is antithetical to a nation there are several versions of Canadian “nationalism.”</p>
<p></p>


<p style="text-indent:-18pt;">
	<span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span style="font:7pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span><b>Maple Syrup Nationalism</b>: This is the sort of patriotic retardation that you see in commercials to exploit people’s tribal instincts for cash. This includes beavers, maple syrup, caribou, bears, camping, canoeing, snow, and many other things. Although these things are all distinctly Canadian these are not things we can build a nation upon. This is not true nationalism.</p>
<p></p>


<p style="text-indent:-18pt;">
	<span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span style="font:7pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span><b>Pierre Trudeau Nationalism</b>: Although Trudeau did not invent it, he was the one put it into full practice. This is the rejection of all things British and instead focusing on multiculturalism, equality, and being more liberal than America. This is the Canada we live into today, and this is the nationalism that takes pride in it. This is taking pride in not being a nation. This is not true nationalism. </p>
<p></p>


<p style="text-indent:-18pt;">
	<span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span style="font:7pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span><b>Quebec Nationalism</b>: The Quebec separatist movement. Bunch of whiners. Not true nationalism.</p>
<p></p>


<p style="text-indent:-18pt;">
	<span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span style="font:7pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span><b>British-Canadian Nationalism</b>: The delusion that Canada will once again be British. This type of nationalism will almost surely never become relevant again. This is not true nationalism.</p>
<p></p>


<p style="text-indent:-18pt;">
	<span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>·<span style="font:7pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span><b>Futurism</b>: This is true Canadian nationalism. It is a rejection of our past, but unlike Trudeau nationalism we strive to create a new identity instead of being content with having none. The nation must die if it wishes to live again.</p>

<p>
	<b><u>The Flag</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<b><u></u></b>


<p>
	<span>                </span>The Red Ensign is a beautiful flag. It often seems that the flag is the biggest point of contention among British-Canadian nationalists. I've even heard some alt-righters ridiculously say that if there was one thing they could change about Canada it would simply be the flag. The dilemma of hating your nation’s current flag, but loving it’s old one is by no means a new dilemma. There was a man you may have heard of that struggled with this same issue, and his name was Adolf Hitler. Adolf Hitler faced a very similar situation that we have, and even wrote about in Mein Kampf. He hated the republic’s flag of black, red, and gold. Even though he despised the republic’s flag he saw it as blessing that the old flag of Germany was not being abused under republic’s regime. We as Canadians should also take peace in the fact that the Red Ensign is not being flown by the tyrannical state of today. Another lesson we can learn from Hitler is that the NSDAP did not adopt the flag of the old Reich. The flag of the old Reich represented ideals that were not compatible with those of national socialism. The Red Ensign represents parliamentarianism. A fascist Canada will never fly a flag that represents parliamentarianism. We must create a new flag just like Hitler did for his people. What this flag will look like is something for us to decide once we are unified. If we use the colours, or symbols of our past does not matter, but rather being a flag we see fit dying for.</p>

<p>
	<b><u>Race</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<b><u></u></b>


<p>
	<span>                </span>It is a fascist’s instinct to become defensive whenever the prospect of mixing races is brought up. When I first joined Iron March just over a month ago, when the idea of crating a new race in Canada was proposed to me I was alarmed that someone could even come up with the idea. I accepted the fact that Canada has many miscellaneous Europeans, and the only realistic option was for them to integrate, but it still made me uneasy. It took me several weeks of personal revelation until it was clear to me. The dividing lines of the race war have already been drawn in Canada. It’s either you’re white, or you’re not white. If we even attempt to redraw those lines it would be suicide. A British-Canadian can not tell himself apart from a European-Canadian, and a European-Canadian can not tell himself apart from British one. The mixing has already begun. Few white Canadians can claim themselves to be 100% pure English, or German, and even few of those of closer knit communities such as Italians, and Ukrainians can claim to be pure nowadays. Creating this new Canadian race is a necessity if we want to create a Canadian identity. You must not be afraid as there is a huge difference between a Swede laying with a Spaniard than there is one Canadian mutt laying with another.</p>

	<b><u>The New Identity</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<b><u></u></b>


<p>
	<span>                </span>“If we don’t have an identity, we’re not going to use the old identity, and we’re just going to mix away our heritage why not just become Americans then?” you may ask. It’s quite simple. One of the few things that still divides Canada, and the United States is the Canadian’s smug feeling of superiority over the obese, consumerist masses located to the south. It’s not that we are better than them, but if you ask any Canadian about the states he’ll give you list of reasons why he thinks America is shit, and why we’re better. Even if it’s coming from a <i>more liberal than thou </i>perspective it is still potential energy that exists in the Canadian people. Any Canadian identity would inherently be an anti-American one as the liberal American spirit is the spirit that occupies Canada today. Fascism will make this superiority a reality. Our men more masculine, our women more feminine, our children more promising, our churches more holy, a passion within our hearts that can never die. This can all be reality; it just takes some extraordinary actions by some extraordinary men.</p>
<p></p>


<p>
	<b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>
<p></p>


<p>
	<span>                </span>Canada has been in a dire situation since it’s conception. The process of purification will be an exhausting, bloody process, but it can be done. The path to victory will be littered with the corpses of our enemies, but also our traitors. We may never see a pure Canada within our lifetimes, but nature will eventually triumph over death just as it always has. As fascists, and as Canadians we must look to our past only with respect. We must look to our future with not mere hope, but a plan. We mustn't let our present stop us from taking action. Don’t give up my friends. When Canada dies, we will be the ones to make it live again.</p>
