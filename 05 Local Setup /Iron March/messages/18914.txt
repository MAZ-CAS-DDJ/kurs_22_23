	Lol, there have been so many sperg threads lately. I guess it's because the forum is getting bigger perhaps.

	ISIS was started in the Sunni Arab regions of Syria and Iraq (see the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Syrian%2C_Iraqi%2C_and_Lebanese_insurgencies.png" rel="external nofollow">gray part of this map</a>). Basically the Tigris River is what splits South Kurdistan from ISIS, and it's pretty much like a different world. A big reason is probably because South Kurdistan is much more feudal than the other regions surrounding it. Whereas Syrian and Iraqi soldiers can be recruited by any other new militant group because there is no traditional leadership structure left, meanwhile South Kurdistan still has the old Kurdish lords from a thousand years ago still ruling it (imagine if the old French or German nobility was never deposed, and that's basically what we have), so there aren't going to be any conflicts or clashes in this turf unless the feudal rulers themselves allow it. It's not ideal of course, but it creates a better sense of stability than the surrounding regions. So yeah, life is going on just as usual here.
