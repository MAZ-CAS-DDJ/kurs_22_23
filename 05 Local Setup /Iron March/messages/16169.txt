	I don't know much about Iran; only that it looks like the West hates them, Americans and Jews are always talking about them negatively as you mentioned, and that a few years ago it looked like they will be the most powerful ally of Russia, but that thing changed later (this balance between Iran and Saudi Arabia is interesting: when Iran becomes pro-Russian Saudi Arabia immediately becomes anti-Russian ant vice versa). They have a great culture and a very ancient civilization too, so I don't see why you despise them (and I have to study Islam more to be able to understand the conflict between Sunnis and Shias).

			You resumed PERFECTLY my dream and my goal, and the dream of Mohamed el Maadi, the only histolrical algerian NS leader, in his book "Afrique du Nord, terre d'histoire" (North Africa, soil of history) A north africa, without niggers, only whites arab-berber et muslim.

	That sounds great! If you have some pictures and quotes by el-Maadi I can make <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/4353-user-content/" rel="">designs like these</a> for propaganda and for your blog. He is not a well-known man, but I found some information about him, they write that:

El Maadi was a knight of the Lègion d'Honneur, holder of the Médaille Militaire and the Croix de Guerre.

	According to this he was a good man of Honor, so it was natural for him to join the Axis. <img alt=":ironmarchy:" data-emoticon="" src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/default_ironmarchy.png" title=":ironmarchy:" /></p>

<p>
	Thank you. I hope that I will be able to unite the Hungarian and Romanian Fascist and solve the question of Transylvania by working together not against each other. That would be the international central of <strong>FASCIST FRIENDSHIP</strong> (only we have to find a better name :D)! I have found a map long time ago and it was strange for me first, but today I think it has a point...

			There were attempts from the Romanian side to come to some understanding with the Hungarians but the politicians then, in 1919, ran madly to the British and the Americans who were not too fond of the Romanians and told them about the “evil” plans of Romania. There were, however, even Hungarians who thought that it was worth sitting down and talking about the Romanian plans. The idea was a kind of dual Romanian-Hungarian monarchy under the Romanian king which would have had three components: the Regat, Transylvania and whatever remained of Hungary. István Bethlen, later prime minister of Hungary, was one of the supporters but most of the Hungarians wouldn’t hear of it although the idea had meritat least in my opinion.

<p>
	So this was actually a plan by both Hungarians and Romanians. That's good to know.

	Thanks for your Skype name, but I have to secure my computer first, and I am not a professional, so until I am done with this I will speak with you here.
