<p>Actually, North Korea fascinates the hell out of me. I've been researching their culture for a long time, and I actually admire their ideologies at its base. The goal of the Kim family is to create a Stalinist workers paradise land based on the worship of the Kims. I watched a documentary (was not made by Americans or pro-capitalists) that showed a North Korean communal art farm where the inhabitants produce movies and such in honor of the NK government. In theory, the idea is nice. Unfortunately, the Kims are raving lunatics. Kim Jong Il, during his reign, supported many capitalists, especially by becoming the number one consumer of Hennessy in the world. They completely mismanage their economy. I do like the idea of Juche. But it is not practically applied. Yes, everything in North Korea is free, but the quality is complete shit because the Kims hoard all the country's resources for themselves and the Party.</p>
<p>If you want a model Marxist country, I suggest you look to Cuba's accomplishments instead of East Asian ultra-nationalism. However, like I said, I think North Korea has the most interesting society in the world, and I do plan on visiting one day. The fact that I am American may be a challenge though.</p>
