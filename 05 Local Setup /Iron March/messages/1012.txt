<p>I wasn't trying to point out any of your family problems, I was merely pointing out you have a wife and kids. I honestly was not taking a jab at you. I'll reword my point.</p>
<p>"You have many family obligations, taking kids places, picking them up, a job, spending time with your wife, making sure the house is running." I didn't mean anything about the affair or whatever.</p>
