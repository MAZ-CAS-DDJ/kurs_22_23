	Well ideologies can be judged by their inner coherency. Their application is another question, but if you have an ideology which is wrong from the start then you can be sure that its result won't be any good either.

	I also like technology and space exploration (sci-fi fan here) but I see the modern phenomena of Scientism as something which rebels against its position in the hierarchy and tries to take the place of those above it, like philosophy or theology. Those should guide science and not the other way around.
