	So Zeiger replied with suggestions:

<p>
	[17:00:44] Zeiger: there's at least 5-10 minutes at the start that should definitely be cut out (it's just the two getting installed, and bob larson talking about uninteresting things)<br />
	[17:01:07] Zeiger: there should be a montage with music instead at the start<br />
	[17:01:19] Zeiger: with some good moments, giving a taste of things to come<br />
	[17:01:40] Zeiger: we need to cut it down, make it shorter<br />
	[17:02:00] Zeiger: if it's over an hour, people can just watch the full interview
