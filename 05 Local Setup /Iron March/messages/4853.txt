<p>I'm usually secret about my age, if i am either to young or to old to fit in any forum/community , anyway im 17, if it helps, probly the youngest here arounde.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you thought i was younger/older please feel free to complain or whatever, if its something that troubles you about me, If it's about my spelling it can be easily explained by the fact that I'm not good in English, so people can easily misunderstood what i am saying and then belive i am saying something i am not actually meaning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It have happaned before, and if anyones angry its my fault.</p>
