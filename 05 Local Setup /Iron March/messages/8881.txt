<p>Looking at cities in google maps? Oh, how many/what other languages can you speak/read? I only have dodgy Russian, and even more dodgy Bulgarian that i've just picked up from friends. I really wanted to learn another language at school, but literally the only language they offered was indonesian. They also offered French and... something else that i wasn't interested in if you paid extra money for them.</p>
