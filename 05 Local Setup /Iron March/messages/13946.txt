	 I think Oswald Spengler made a good point on religion (yes i just will go full Spengler-fag man)... religion tends to show the vitality and strenght of a young Nation or Culture in her first stage of organic development (every stage of organic development is a different Spirit of the Age.. in humans, we have something like that: there is first a kid, then a young man, then an adult and then an old man and then die, same happens with Cultures). Also, Egon Friedell which is an spenglerian philosopher, wrotted, that, religions like Gothic Catholicism, were just an organized pshycological system of sacralization of the Things that is carried out by a young culture, re, it was about to see all the things in a different manner... thats why people in that kind of age tends to be more self-confident and strong but also extremely more credule, because they see the world in a very beautifull way.

	 But Religion is just part of an Organic stage, in the lasts organic stages of a Culture, she lost her first potential... also Spengler said that in those last stage of a Culture which is dying, it start a second religioussness within the people, but its not like the first time.

	 The final possition on religion is that of skepticism (Spengler-fag again), i dont know if god exist, nor i care... also i dont trust nor care science nor philosophy either, because i just think that this world cannot be explained already, its impossible to explain the world, i just tend to look religion from an Historical outlook (this is: just watch the Racial currents and groups in History that carries religion... because religion is racially determinated and is mostly driven by organic forces)
