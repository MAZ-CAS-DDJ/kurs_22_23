<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just wanted to say thanks for putting in the effort &amp; posting plenty of material into the AusNZ subforum, I've been absent a bit lately &amp; was worried Slavros might give it the chop but the activity in it has clearly been kept up- cheers for that, it's great to see it getting used. Logging on and seeing Aus-centric stuff here is a great feeling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ta,</p>
