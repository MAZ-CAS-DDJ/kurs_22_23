	IIRC we were invading Carpathian Ruthenia the same day they declared independence, but I meant the position of the second Czechoslovakian state. At that time Carpathian Ruthenia was already Soviet territory, I guess Czechoslovakia couldn't really talk about retaking it. How does the Slovak Nationalists see it today?
