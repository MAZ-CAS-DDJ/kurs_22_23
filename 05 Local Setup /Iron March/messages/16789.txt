			Still not getting my point yes they take the people you don't like with them but also people who could share the same views as you, or even you yourself if you happen to be standing in their completely random unpredictable line of fire at a store or at a school.

	That's pretty much a given.<br />
	A prerequisite of fascism is an acceptance of death in the event of something like that. <br />
	If the year was 1936 I'd be exactly like you and be sickened by such mindless violence.<br />
	But we're in the current year and shit like this doesn't sicken me any more, the modern world has corrupted us. I've grown comfortable with violence because a lot of it needs to happen.<br />
	I know Trump is a cuck, I've stopped riding the /pol/ hype train and just became apathetic to it all. <br />
	What really rustles my jimmmies is how overly dramatic the lefties are about him. I'm actually pretty grateful for the left for fanning the fires of racism when Trump is trying to becoming milder. It's because of the left racial tensions are still there, they're are unwitting allies in that way. <br />
	My Dad is pretty pro-Dueterte yes, he's bought some land in Philippines and is planning in building a family estate or something but I don't think Dueterte is the messiah that many of my countrymen think he is.<br />
	I think my sisters are a lost cause, I've gotten into arguments about Trump. They've been raised in a multicultural environment for a long time and I sorta blame their Catholic upbringing making them so soft. <br />
	Also I think that nihilist phase is something that happens to all of us. <br />
	Sometimes I'm glad humanity would die out because it'd mean the end of this Utopian leftist cancer.<br />
	But funny enough reading Mein Kampf is what kinda made me sorta more optimistic. <br />
	I think thats why I'm very loyal to the Fuhrer even though I'm not aryan at all, the guy's story is just something a lot of us can relate to.<br />
	He was just a normal kid from Austria with dreams of being an artist, went to Vienna, saw the degeneracy everywhere and was disillusioned by it all before deciding to do something about it. <br />
	I think if we're all dying might as well do it fighting, it might not make a difference but shit at least we don't look like a bunch of pussies.
