<p>Hello,</p>
<p>If I remember correctly you created a thread a couple of weeks ago about Wikipedia. I was just wondering if you have any experience writing articles on there. I'm looking to create an entry for the American Blackshirts, so if you have any advice you can give me it would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>It's not the complex, i mean if you've designed your own website (or someone in your organization has)  then setting up a wiki page should be pretty simple.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just write descriptions detail, imbed links, add pictures illustrations relevant to what is being said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Try to write it in a sort of objective way, with no emotion attached to the articles so that it doesn't send of a red flag to the moderators their, might want to make an account with fals names in an alt email adress etc as well. It's up to you really</p>
