	I found an existing crew already, it wasn't totally my own doing. Haha But I did find the Alt Right guys and they're decently organized themselves and I meet them often. Actually I'm going to be meeting them today and a few more new faces.

	Yeah I know of who he is, but I never met him personally. He joined in shortly after I left. But basically I knew all the main characters from before. Lee, Kyle McKee, John Marleau when he was in it, etc. I was basically the one who started the chapter in Edmonton, so all those Edmonton guys were my guys as well. But BH doesn't exist in Edmonton after I left the organization.
