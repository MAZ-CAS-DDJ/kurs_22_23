<p>Somehow part of my original message is missing from the conversation and I think we are on the same page but I'll quote it again:<br /><br />"</p>

He became involved in an anti-immigrant organizing group. He has written he meets monthly at McDonalds with Indiana State Police and the FBI to discuss the white movement. He is not paid -- though he would be if he was smart enough to ask. He's an informant.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">In the future, if the government decides he is suitable for a "leadership" role, others will be told to go on white message boards and support him. He may be asked from time to time to speak well, or speak badly, of other white activists. MP may not even realize he is being manipulated -- but he is being used.</span></p>
<p> "<br /><br />I had assumed MP was Matt Parrott, as he is has referenced several times (that i have seen) on facebook how much he likes McDonalds.  Even yesterday he was lamenting their phasing out of the dollar menu.  I actually think its plausible that Matt is mentally ill despite all the accusations of autism.  I could totally picture him naively maintaining a dialogue with law enforcement.   Part of what brought this up for me is I couldn't help but wonder where he has come up with the time/money to do all the tradyouth trips while supporting a family.  <br /><br />Also, it seems the SpenglersGhost user who recently joined IM has some connection with the Bill White case as they were also posting about it on reddit.com/r/new_right just the other day.   I also know "Brett Stevens" has been a close affiliate of Bill White for some years.   I dont think he has anything to do with the Bill White blog but I can't quite tell.  I don't know, but can't tell for sure.  It does link to a couple of his blogs.  Anyway I consider "Brett" to have ulterior motives at the very least for his 'activism' and I dont want to go through the people behind that blog order to clarify the above.  Of course it is unlikely either they or SpenglersGhost could help, and White himself sits in jail.<br /><br />All in all I think Bill White is very eccentric (look at the books he has written) but reliable.<br /><br />Anyway, enough rambling.  I don't think there is any point in spreading this information without more to base it on than White's accusation.<br /><br />Also you're right about the DGR material I've read it before.  All in all various anarchist resources have a lot of solid information on security culture that would be completely useful to our side.</p>
