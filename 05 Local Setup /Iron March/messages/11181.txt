<p>Hey Hermann,</p>
<p>This is Blackshirt 13 here. I am sorry to bother you but I have a couple of questions for you. I noticed your post in the Paganism thread and I was just wondering were you found that out about the other Norse afterlifes? Was it in the Edda or the Sagas? Also, I always kind of wondered but if a war ever broke and we were to fight and die for our fascist beliefs, is it possible for us to go to Valhalla? Sorry, if that sounds spergy, I have just always wondered if you die fighting for your beliefs if that would be a way to enter Valhalla? I am basing all of this on the assumption that you believe in Valhalla. I am not really sure what to believe religion wise. Anyways, sorry to bother you and please let me know if you get this message.</p>
<p>Hail,</p>
