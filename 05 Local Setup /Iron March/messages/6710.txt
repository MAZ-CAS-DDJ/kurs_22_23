<p>Honestly, if you're genuinely serious about being a fascist, then go and read. Read Mein Kampf for sure, and anything else you can get your hands on spoken from a fascist and/or National Socialist point of view. Come back when you're at least 14 or 15 (if not older), have matured a bit more, and are able to carry a conversation in a less faggy way with a bit more knowledge under your belt. </p>
