<p>Here's another good one I liked.</p>

<p>I skipped over uni and took up a trade when I first left school, made my money that way and then went to work for the NHS for a while under a high paid band up until recently but I am aware that university is shit. Luckily the subjects which matter like physics and STEM are filling up with average or right-leaning guys (and a few females here and there for diversity's sake and sometimes some eye candy <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" />) the other downside is the overall culture of university is dominated by leftists who have no class, character or original thoughts; which is a shame because if anybody knows how to have fun it's fascists. I love National Action's niche of raiding universities, causing mischief and getting in their faces.</p>
<p>I can't recommend Whitaker's book enough, it completely changed the way I look at things.</p>
