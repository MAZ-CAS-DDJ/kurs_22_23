	"One VERY important thing about the Legion is that it had no affiliation with the holocaust (which I do not believe happened), but unfortunately the uneducated masses have bought into the holocaust lie, preventing many people from looking into the NSDAP at all.  The legion is exempt from that, which provides an extreme potential for growth, drawing in people who would not usually associate with National Socialism due to the holocaust.  "

	Basically we aren't looking for opportunities for growth or to appeal to any amount of people. Fascists will always be the small minority - that's why 100 Breiviks who fight the system using violence are worth more than a million 'fascists' who think about what their image will be and how this can attract more followers. People that are scared to call themselves "Nazi/Fascist/NS/" - we don't need them
