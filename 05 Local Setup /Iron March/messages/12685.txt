<p>I'm glad to hear this, also we would be interested in setting up a Californian chapter. All I can really ask of you now is to give me your Skype name, we can schedule a Skype call when you're free. Also, we have no problem with you cooperating and working with our friends in REACTION USA. They are in your state and they are also fellow American Fascists as well, I can vouch that they are active and good, I have spoken to their leader and they are fantastic. </p>

<p>Also glad to hear your in NROTC, people that have military experience or are current military, are very valuable to our cause. Your enthusiasm for Atomwaffen also is very good. If you don't happen to have a Skype, please set one up as soon as possible. P.S Wolves of Vinland are good folks, but there's a lot of agents in their group. Just be weary of that.</p>
