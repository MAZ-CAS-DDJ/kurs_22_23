<p>Yeah, I thought I'd found a place with my friend, but her roommates didn't like it. Then I messaged someone online about it, and they said they were looking for a queer roommate interested in social justice. I'm not kidding. So I messaged a bunch of people on Craigslist. If I don't find a roommate I'll just sleep in my car, save some money.</p>
