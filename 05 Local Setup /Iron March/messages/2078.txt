<p>Those folks are probably joshing around, they like to give me a hard time about the Southern expressions I take to using. My views are pretty straight forwardly Fascist_ Authority, Hierarchy, Militarism, Nationalism, Imperialism, Discipline, Traditionalism. I oppose Dumbocracy, all forms of Socialist/Communism/Anarchism/Mutualism/Synidcalism, Equalitarianism, and general dipshitery. The way I'm kinda of different from the original Fascist crew is that instead of Corporatism I prefer a less beaurcratic form of Capitalism is all.</p>
<p>Nice talkin' with ya,</p>
