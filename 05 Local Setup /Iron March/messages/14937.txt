	No. I still have a book to finish, mostly about Suicide and Letting go of ties to people in the world to become more efficient. I started writing it after Joey blew his brains out. Ex-chapter member, think I talked about him a few times. His story was basically broken up with his, kicked out of his house, contracted STDs from this slut, who told everyone about his life, ruined his life, pretty much everyone in his life turned on him, he started taking PCP again (we both did in HS), a week later blew his brains out with a shotgun. <br /><br />
	My old friend Mike, who actually did wind up working for Gerald Lauck, started up another chapter, one more focused on what I intended to do with my first chapter, and he wants me to help lead it. There's also some cult shit. <br /><br />
	I mean, I'm always going to be on here, my shit stays here permanently. If my name is going to get besmirched or what the fuck ever, I don't care. But I'll be around, I'll probably start focusing on some of the ritualistic shit and a lot of the fitness/training, which I figure might be motivating to a few folks on here.
