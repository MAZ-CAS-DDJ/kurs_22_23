	Greetings!
</p>

<p>
	I am Lucius, and I recently registered in this forum with the hope of bringing more people to a community of fellow National Socialists across the world. Our community is called ''New Force'' and we conform a relatively new group, with people from Italy, Sweden, Spain and UK in it.<br /><br />
	In fact, a member of "Swedish Democrats" (a nationalistic political party from Sweden) is present in our community.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	The "raison d'être" of the group is chiefly to organize us against the progressive left and also discuss and debate current news.
</p>

<p>
	Furthermore, we're striving to accomplish several other targets, like extending the truth we already know to the people (propaganda).
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Currently, we constitute only a Telegram group. You can leave and rejoin whenever you want to, and there obviously isn't any kind of membership at all. It is free.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, the group is Pan-European and International. It is also a new community, so we are now immersed in the growing phase of every community.
