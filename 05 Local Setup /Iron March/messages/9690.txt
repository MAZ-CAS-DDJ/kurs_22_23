<p>I just used tape because it's specifically a birthday poster and wouldn't make sense to be up for a long time. I didn't cover my face because nonpermanent posters are just free speech, not vandalism (looked that up). But I had sunglasses on. If I were wheatpasting I would have done it at night.</p>
