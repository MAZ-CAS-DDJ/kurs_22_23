<p>Hey boss,</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much time you have in the near future, but I was wondering if you think we Americans should start networking, perhaps outside of IM. While there are some good people here, moronic sperg trolls like Vlad and the perpetually lamenting such as AB make a lot of the discussions rather futile. </p>
<p>There is not doubt that America is imperfect, but I think we need a greater vision than many of the knee-jerk 4chan personalities on this board represent. Even Mussolini used the National Bloc, a group containing various nationalist, conservative and catholic associations, to reach power in Italy.</p>
<p>I am rambling, but do you think it would make sense to form a large umbrella nationalist group/network (perhaps with an initially "non-racist" outlook) to help attract wider support? Though I could be wrong, I suspect IM is not going to grow very fast with all the blatant Nazism displayed on the site, least not amongst the "Israel is our greatest ally" types in our country. We need to do a better job of marketing nationalism and fascism without expecting Americans to immediately jump on board with the sieg heiling and whatnot. </p>
<p>Just my opinion.  </p>
