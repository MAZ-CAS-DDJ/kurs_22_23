<p>I have no problems with people wanting to stick with Western Rite Orthodoxy, you may be interested in these guys.</p>

<p>I'm kind of responsible for that in a way, I kind of got turned off with their whole, "ZOMG ORFODOX MUNRCHY IN MUH MIDWEST MURRIKA!  herpderp CONVERT MURRIKA!" Nice idea... but it'd never work. Although the guys who started this know that, they claim its a great motivator for people. I'm not sure if I'd work with them or not anymore.</p>
<p>As far as my political crisis. I really don't know what I'm going to do. I'd say I'd drop out but I can't because I'm destined to be a Fascist forever. And to drop out wouldn't mean much since I haven't really done much. I'm going to take life a day at a time and just kind of see what happens.</p>
