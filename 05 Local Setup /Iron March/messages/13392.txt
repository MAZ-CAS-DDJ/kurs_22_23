	Yeah, always figured it was just harmless hazing anyways. Also, I forgot to ask but how many Axis missions do you get in MOW Assault Squad 2? As I seriously only play the Axis campaigns and nothing else in a WW2 games that I play. Hell, I won't even consider playing a WW2 game if I can't play as the Axis. Also, I will probably buy it off of Steam next month or wait tell it goes on sale and then try it. If it doesn't work I can always get a refund, which I have had to do a LOT already because the games wouldn't work on my computer. Kind of surprised they haven kicked me off of Steam for all the refunds tbh.
