<p>I am trying to include the fact that I, like every other Oklahoman, am part Indian. I am wanting to show that, firstly, the Indians which sought to assimilate within the new state, were sort of fucked over by the war like savage tribes who wanted to halt the march if progress and return to savagery based on a purely traditionalist mindset. </p>
<p>I have also tried to explain that I, as a descendent of those civilized tribes, am better off today, because of the presence of the new, white nation.</p>
