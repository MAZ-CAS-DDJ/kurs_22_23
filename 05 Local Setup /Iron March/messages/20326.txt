	Got a question about action reports; unfortunately, not much has happened this month. There's a few reasons why we haven't done much, but they're not really important. There's two minor things we might potentially be able to report on, which were stickering up a commie bookstore from the inside, and putting a graffiti mural up, but is it worth it? I was thinking of putting it on our twitter, but it seems like it'd make a pretty lame 'action' report. Would it be better to just give it a miss?

	Also is there a reason I can't message Ben, on tutanota or here?
