	First off, I was waiting for a confirmation email and never got it, twice, I did bookmark the Awaiting Validation page, something told me not to delete my history or my cookies so it appears you let me in, I wanted to change my password but I forgot the first one, why, because I was tired when i found this site and didnt follow my usual protocol of saving stuff, it happens when you're inyour mid 50s. Before I do an introduction I need to change my password, I probably should change my email address to one of my more legit ones i have but I need a password. What should I do, can you do something or should i start from the beginning? If you have Facebook I can give you my name, it's unmistakably Ukrainian even though I was born in the USA. I await your suggestion.
