<p>Mark Dyal has a pretty cool story of his time in Italy in his interview with Greg Johnson. It really made me come to the realization of how atomized we are here in the U.S. On that note I also read his articles on Nietzsche and Lycurgus: the law giver of Sparta. The Lycurgus one was the better of the two. So what are you views on Christianity and how do you differ from Mark Dyal? I don't really know his views on Christianity my self. </p>
<p>By the way, you have some pretty cool quotes on your page.</p>
