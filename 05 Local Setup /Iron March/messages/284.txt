<p>I've seen how you're ideology is 'Peronism'.</p>
<p>I liked Peron &amp; his wife, but from what I gather there is a lot of confusion surrounding what exactly Peronism is.</p>
<p>Apparently, both the Left &amp; the Right claim to be the rightful ideological successors of Peron's legacy.</p>
<p>I would be very interested in knowing what YOU say Peronism is.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Yep, at the moment there's a huge argument over what it really is. I believe in Peron's original Peronism, which was mostly based on Mussolini's policies and is Third-positionist. Unlike Mussolini though, he didn't really believed in using violence as much as Mussolini and had different opinions on Labour Unions (He believed they should be Nationalised, rather than abolished). He virtually had the same ideas as Mussolini on everything (Highly nationalist, Somewhat isolationist, Corporatism etc.).</p>
<p>Most people claiming to be the successors of Peron really aren't, and are just stating that to gain popular support (Peron is still loved in Argentina).</p>
