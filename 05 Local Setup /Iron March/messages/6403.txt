<p>Thought of starting my own but with no particular audience in mind, more of a "my free speech/opinion - nationalist or not, if you don't like it, tough shit. If you do, good for you, let's meet up and have a laugh" kind of deal. Aside from that I haven't given it much thought, I prefer talking to people in person and on a casual level. Most "movement" nationalists would shun me alone because I'd condone commiting fraud to better your life at the expense of the current system and further your own goals.</p>

<p>It'd probably be more beneficial than posting as frequently as I do here. Like I've said before, I post here solely to help form peoples opinions. It worked with anti-intellectualism, racism, anti-semitism, fag bashing and eventually it will be anti-christianism, an anti-prude attitude, anti-victim, anti nerd, a pro-Free Enterprise, pro-aesthetic and view of relative freedom I want to popularize similar to those A. Freeman, Rockwell and Mosley proposed. Prior to me posting here everybody wanted to appear respectable and a "reasonable racist" and thought there could be "normal queers".</p>

<p>Ancient Greece minus the pederasty is the ideal type of mindset and even then I think there should be institutions where a man teaches a boy about manhood and a woman teaches a girl about womanhood, I just don't think rubbing your penis between their thighs is the way to do it and I'd imagine it's gross. If you parallel Mein Kampf to The Republic however, the similarities of the points <strong>and </strong>the way they are explained are striking.</p>

<p>To hell with "tradition", I'm for nature and what works best for my race and myself in it if some of those things are "traditional" then so be it.</p>
