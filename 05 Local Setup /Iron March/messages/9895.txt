<p>I wouldn't be too optimistic, the average American is far more liberal than the average German of that time, yet the degeneracy in the Weimar cities from the jews and bourgeoisie was maybe as bad as our time, maybe worse. It also wasn't so politicized, they didn't claim moral superiority for doing it like today. Meanwhile the vast majority of Germans were living in starvation conditions.</p>

<p>An Afrikaner too? Afrikaners are my favorite people, I went camping with my Afrikaner friends last weekend and it was great. They don't even hide that they see blacks as savages, haha. Even the more liberal ones. Part Afrikaner and she gets MK references? I wouldn't be worried on what she thinks about anything. </p>
<p>Keep talking to her and her boundaries will come down eventually. If she says no to something don't get offended, just brush it off and keep talking. Persistence and respect is key.</p>
