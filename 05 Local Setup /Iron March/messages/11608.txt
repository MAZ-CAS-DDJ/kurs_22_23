<p>I'm saying I''m not even planning on having children especially not if things getting worse we should focus on spiritual learning so when we either transcend or die (most likely the second one) we will be reunited with the ancient deities and the truth of the universe and will eventually reach the golden age or maybe even transcend physical matte and not have to come back. Slavros was saying something about steps of fascism from race based hierarchy the further up the hierarchy ti seems to me the less biological and physical you should concern your self with ergo no need to procreate , when you could study spirituality and transcend why create a being that will pull down your spiritual energy thats connected to you by possibly becoming degenerate. that's my reasoning because a purely biological conception of fascism is just ridiculous with out the hierarchy and cosmic order its meaningless. therefore in this age there is no reason to procreate unless we've reached a state of being more spiriutal like the descriptions of the ancient hyperboreans, were not spiritual were material, in ancient times even when it was good to have children those that focused soley on transcendance didnt usually have children. I guess you mentioned aryan breeding it got me thinking on that subject of procreation.</p>
