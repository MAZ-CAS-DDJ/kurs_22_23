	The thread's been closed to replies, but I only just now noticed you'd asked me those 2 questions, so to satisfy your curiosity;
</p>

<p>
	1. What's your ideal economic policy
</p>

<p>
	Closely controlled state capitalism with plenty of rules in place to restrict the power of usurers
</p>

<p>
	<br />
	2. Ever had Kangaroo meat? I swear to god it's delicious.
</p>

<p>
	I've had it a few times, but I've never been able to cook it right - it always ends up really tough and not especially flavoursome - when other people have cooked it for me, it's been a lot nicer, and although it's pretty finicky to cook, when done according to the right secret recipes, with the right herbs and spices, it's incredibly juicy and filling.
