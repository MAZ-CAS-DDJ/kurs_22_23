	Hello there. <br />
	I saw your post in the United States section about the possibility of starting a new American movement. I am/was a member of Atomwaffen. I'm sure you heard about the BU stickering and the subsequent shoah-shitstorm and attention it brought. I was actually one of two people who carried out the BU stickering, and I designed the propaganda as well. Unfortunately, the leader of Atomwaffen has come out as a convert to Islam. For what I hope are obvious reasons, I am not willing to continue with an organization headed by a muslim. Which leads me to the point of this message.<br /><br />
	I would be really interested, if you are willing, in starting a new American fascist movement as well. There has been a topic started about reviving the old Silver Legion (1930s American fascist movement). I think this is actually an awesome idea, and I'm seriously considering using it as the basis for a new organization. If you'd be interested in joining forces and getting this machine moving, I would love to help however possible. <br />
	Sincerely,<br />
	Trying to find a new, Islam-free activist group
