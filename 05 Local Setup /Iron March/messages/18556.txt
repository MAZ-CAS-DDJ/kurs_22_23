	The newest form of Eurasianism is mainly connected to the Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin. He is rather shady and sometimes even chaotic in his thinking and while he criticizes Fascism and Racism he maintains a bizarre post-Soviet Romanticism and cultural Relativism at the same time. Most of the guys on IronMarch despising him for these reasons but while I see the faults of his character too, I still think he has a lot of great ideas (some of them borrowed from the earlier Eurasianists), which seems to be in line with the late organic Imperial idea of the Third Reich manifested in the Charlottenburg declaration.

	He also talks a lot about the great empires of the past, namely that of Huns, Turks, Mongols, Russians and Soviets, what he sees more like different manifestations of the same eternal Eurasian Empire, the guardian of the Universal Tradition and thus transcending every one of these nations and their religions. Here is a link to our <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/6930-roman-von-ungern-sternberg/" rel="">thread on Ungern Khan</a>, admired by Dugin and his Eurasianists as well as other Traditionalists, as well as one to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geographical_Pivot_of_History" rel="external nofollow">Halford Mackinder's Heartland theory</a> what is one of the main pillars of the Eurasianist geopolitical thinking.

And a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpzxw2u1C8Q" rel="external nofollow">third one</a> in which he talks about his position towards what he calls the main three political ideas of Modernity. In this you will notice how he is trying to oppose Fascism from a Traditional position (while admitting that historical Fascism is the closest to his ideas) which is the same stance Evola made, only he was way more authentic naturally.

	One of the recent newbies also started a <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/7610-the-fourth-estate-dugin/" rel="">new topic on him</a>, and finally here is <a href="https://www.counter-currents.com/2013/12/milestones-of-eurasism/" rel="external nofollow">another analysis</a> I haven't read yet but looks interesting. When I first met with neo-Eurasianism I thought it has the potential to breed an ideology which will be "more Fascist than Fascism was", while on the surface will be less radical which would ensure its survival in our times. Some kind of Spiritual Fascism, what would follow the Christian principle of <em>"render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's"</em>. IronMarch made me somewhat critic towards that though.
