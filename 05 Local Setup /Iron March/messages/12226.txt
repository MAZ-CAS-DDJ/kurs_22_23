<p>Yeah no, that's not on me, that's on Hitler, he literally wrote that in Mein Kampf as did many other people that we follow. We've been given all the answers and all the tools long ago which is what we fail at, the movement keeps constantly walking into the same rake time and time again, retreading same lost ground. Creating a concise way of delivering all these lessons as quickly as possible to newcomers and hopefuls is important so as to break that cycle but it only amounts to retelling of the same lessons in shorter format.</p>

<p>And yeah the altright just keeps being an embarrassment to itself but its not that much of a surprise considering that they are formed from everyone who found themselves on the right to the new progressive left, they're literally just defined in their tent unity by opposition to SJWs and rejection of being fascists because, well that's just wrooong, but they'll bear the name as a joke, "i'm so fashy". Basically it's an attempt to create a movement out of everyone between the two extremes, all the lemmings, all the "comic book readers" that exist between the fanatics, as Rockwell described it. It'll ultimately crash or a split will occur with anyone who has potential to be a fascist leaving/splitting the entire scene.</p>
