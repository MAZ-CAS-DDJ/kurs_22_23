	Tutanota is an encrypted email service, you can get the app for your phone too
</p>

<p>
	It's neat, and helpful as things like outlook aren't secure<br />

	I'd make an account for that then send the email off from there, just trying to make things easier for you mate<br />
	We've got a meet up for new guys in roughly a weeks time, so you might be offered to meet up then (I'll try to be at the meet up with you)<br />
	Also, my tuta is the same as my username but all lowercase [my user]@tutanota.c o m<br />
	So once you've made one send me an email on there if you want to dicuss anything :)
