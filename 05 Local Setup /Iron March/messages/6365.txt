<p>Rockwell's gonna be a good one for my son, he's one of the more modern but original alpha males in the movement, In some ways I think he even explained and presented his concepts in such a way that they were better than Hitler's without straying from National Socialism itself. It is the greatest shame GLR was assassinated; who knows what may have been had he continued to live. I credit Rockwell with creating a proto-version of our liberal degeneration thread, it's right at the start of white power.</p>

<p>Rockwell understood a very basic principle, it applies to anybody but especially well to children. Most people - through lack of, or the wrong kind of education, do not have the ability to reason. And when someone can't conceive of logical arguments, they are highly unlikely to see them in other people. Whilst the level of reasoning ability does depend on your audience there is a need for irrationality in just about any debate. Dry reason alone is not likely to overcome this century's most entrenched taboo, or the fears of its "victims."</p>

<p>Very often people are more willing to learn from personal experiences and spoken word. The arguments of a remote layman who could have any number of motives are likely to be ignored if they are not shown to pertain to real life. I found this out a long time a go when I saw posting empirical studies by Richard Lynn and William Shockley made little difference with the vast majority of people. It works best when you use a bit of this but mainly explain the phenomenon later after an examplehas been given. I spoke of this in the Blacks and fascism thread (I think it's in the race sub-category of this site).</p>

<p>Similarly, you can argue from your own personal experience. This can be touted as the <i>very reason</i> that you want to press forward an argument. There is nothing rational about authority itself. But opponents and readers are more likely to believe an argument if it is supported by secondary sources, including the news media, government figures and the scientific establishment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Debates with audiences who may be seen as "tabloid readers" or "underclass" should avoid any advanced use of rational devices. In fact, any use of reason with such an audience should be restricted to the clearest and most striking of maxims, rationalisations and factoids. Rockwell understood this brilliantly.</p>

<p>I particularly like these excerpts from This time the world and White Power which explain what I'm sayng now.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>I assimilated this experience with millions of others and did not even notice whether the hundreds of Jews<br />in Atlantic City High School, where I went for four years and many of whom were my best friends, were Jews<br />or Hottentots. That may be an unfortunate choice of words, because hundreds of my school comrades in<br />Atlantic City were Hottentots! And I didn't particularly notice or care about this either. The Jews simply cannot<br />accept it, of course and the brainwashed will not accept it, but my hatred of organized Jewry stems directly and<br />only from the discovery of what most -- but not all -- Jews are doing to the Nation and the People I love. There<br />may have been some slight vestiges of prejudice in my upbringing, but no more than in the upbringing of<br />millions of other American boys who are not leading Hitler movements.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>I was running into the disease of our modern life: cowardice and pathological fear of a strong personality or<br />strong ideas. Dale Carnegie has codified and commercialized this creeping disease as "how to win friends and<br />influence people", which boils down to the essential principle of having no personality or strong feelings or<br />ideas and becoming passive and empty so that "the other fellow" can display his ideas and personality. But he,<br />too, is trying to become popular by being passive and dispassionate, so that the result is like connecting two<br />dead batteries: no current. Such human robots are suited to enslavement by a 1984-type society, but not to life in<br />a bold, free society of men. This is the way women should be, perhaps, but not our men and especially not our<br />leaders.<p>I found the same feeble feminine approach in every subject except in the sciences, and for these last, I was very<br />grateful. In geology and psychology I could find a few principles and laws which stayed there when I reached<br />out to grasp them, and so I reveled in these subjects and rebelled to the limit of my capacity in the others. In<br />sociology I went so far as to write an insolent examination paper which almost got me thrown out of Brown. We<br />were asked to write an essay answer on the factors leading to criminality and delinquency.</p>
<p>I wrote nothing but a fable about a crew of scientific geniuses who set out for Africa to see what made ants act<br />like ants. They searched around until they found a lot of anthills, observed them for many years and finally came<br />up with the discovery that when ant eggs were hatched in tunnels in a certain kind of hill in Africa and grew up<br />among six-legged creatures called "ants", they themselves were so affected by this strong environment that they<br />became, themselves, ants and waved their antennae like ants, scurried around aimlessly like ants, looked like<br />ants and were ants!</p>
<p>Once again, I was hauled up before the administration for this impudence and almost thrown out. However, I<br />was given another opportunity to write the exam and for the sake of my dear good grandmother and my patient,<br />loving Aunt Margie, I sat down and wrote what I knew they wanted -- a piece showing how unfortunate and<br />most excellent babies were invariably driven to stealing from their parents, relatives and friends, robbing<br />strangers at gunpoint and finally axing somebody in sheer desperation at their nasty environment. This was<br />passed with a C plus.</p>

<p>Of course if you've ever heard one of Rockwell's speeches you'll know he uses authoritive sources too, such as US government documents, the FBI, jewish sources and even Winston Churchill to make some of his points to his audience.</p>
