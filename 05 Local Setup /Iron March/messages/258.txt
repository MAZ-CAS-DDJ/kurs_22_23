<p>Hey NSP,</p>
<p>I post on the Socialist Phalanx forum, a forum for revolutionary socialists and left-wing nationalists. A little while ago, someone from your NSP posted on our forum under the username Nationaal-Syndicalist. Was that you or a comrade of yours? If it wasn't you, one of us debated him on the relative merits of syndicalism and corporatism here: <a href="http://www.socialistphalanx.com/t323-sir-oswald-mosely-the-true-revolutionary#4606" rel="external nofollow">http://www.socialistphalanx.com/t323-sir-oswald-mosely-the-true-revolutionary#4606</a></p>
<p>Regards,</p>
