<p>I did a few edits to the quotes so I'm letting you check if they're fine. Not including the classes/parties quote as its more to do with policies and that's not what the banner quotes are about:</p>
<p>We need fighters, not voters. Because only combatants remain loyal to the end.</p>
<p>The nation is a being of a higher order, existing independently of those individuals of whom it is temporarily composed. It is not a physical being, with a head, arms, legs, eyes. It is a moral and historical entity, which lives and acts in human history, carrying its national symbols.</p>
<p>For a healthy body, all cells must be healthy. Basic biological cell on which the body is based must be healthy. And the cell of society - family - is ill. Seriously ill.</p>
<p>Everything is possible for a man who asks nothing for himself.</p>
<p>Neither Hitlerism nor Fascsim, only ZBOR!</p>
<p>You think that the state is less dangerous than a gun? From one gun, out of negligence, one, two or few more people can die. From poorly thought out state affairs - hundreds of thousands and millions of people can die.</p>
<p>Europe's suffering today is a natural consequence of how greatly and for how long she drifted from her path. All beauty and all strength of Europe, her wisdom and wealth, came under the sign of Christ's cross, but during her last hundred and fifty years of history, Europe has sold herself to heathenism and materialistic Chrstconflict (ХРИСТОБОРСТВО), and like that she lost her way. </p>
<p>ALSO Christconflict - technically doesn't fully reflect the meaning of the word I think, since I figure its more about actively denying and fighting christ, so it has to be something like anti-christism or something to that extent no?</p>
