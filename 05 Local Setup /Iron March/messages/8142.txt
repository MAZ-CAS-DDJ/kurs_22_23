<p>G'day mate, long replies don't bother me just don't always expect an equally detailed and well written reply back...haha. I'm just a typical working class bloke, never been to university but have read enough to understand and convey a message to peers, in which I've been granted credit, where it is due. Explaining things to people to whom don't really have an understanding of national socialism or nationalism isn't so hard.</p>
<p> I must admit it is quite intimidating when it comes to a place like Iron March, or fellow nationalists, when they understand or know more than yourself, it seems stale, your opinions ,as many others have come before you and said what you think your saying, but a million times better, in saying that I'm not a retarded white nationalist type, like you mate, I've lived a life well out of line with what the typical spergy ns goon may prescribe as 'in line' with perhaps what the ns was doing in the 30's, iron march and especially NA realises the worth of the whole white nationalist ballsy ns side of the idea but portrayed it in a refreshing and somewhat 21st century way, which I agree with you, we need in Australia.</p>
<p>I will agree that it will be hard to re create, when one half of our youth rejects bogan's or Australiana type nationalism (lawson/old labor/nedkelly/southern cross tats), rural youth really and the other half, the urban youth, in which uni students make the bulk of, are trendy metro type lads. That shouldn't really be too much of a problem anyway, our propaganda needs to be a blend of both the 21st century European Fascist and the old Aus first type figure heads...lawson etc..as many people will listen to a man of the calibre of lawson, which may help common folk to realise it's not an extreme opinion we have, nor un-favourable.</p>
<p>Mate I've worked with a lot of different people in life and never not got along with them, I can put up with most type of people, beside bleeding heart homo boong loving commies really, so I'm sure we will get along, I don't know fuck all about graphic design either, I'd probably want Ben to design any propaganda for a movement...it's too fuckin good but can't be that hard to nail surely...Albany is a shit place for doing any type of propaganda...it's 90% over 45 and pretty white...it would go over their heads + small town and I'm surely to get myself in the shit...but il give it a shot soon cos me ne frego in the end. </p>
<p>Perth is defiantly where we need to attack. Australia first holds meetings with Jim every know and then up there, missed out on most of them because of work but yes it would be a great place to meet people...I don't know why blood and honour doesn't keep more active...thy have a solid base in Perth but I've never seen them really active within society, it is what kept me from joining them, just seemed like skinhead gatherings, good potential for certain wings of propaganda though. I play music with a few lads aswell, when we do get around to seriousness it will be fascist lyrics but not in a skinhead way....more so a subliminal traditional/fash direction, which actually does work in bringing people more towards understanding and becoming involved in our worldview. </p>
<p>Anyway worrying about big tent isn't what we should be doing, NA has proved that very fuckin well, quality over quantity...what do you think about the daily stormer ? I "red pilled" my old man through giving him mein kampf to read, as I agree that it is completely relevant today probably even more so, and other literature + the daily stormer...he has spread it to a lot of people including to one of the local footy captains who has help spread it elsewhere...I think it's a nice easy to access site without curtailing on extremity per say even though it's basically white nationalism and a lot of spergy Christian identity conspiracy theorists...it's a pity IM doesn't seem to like Anglin.</p>
<p>Within the mining sector their is potential for a nationalist union against immigrant labor, the protection of our jobs and the spiritual re-birth, that not only do us miners who toil away and pay high taxes work for the betterment of our own pocket but for the greater good of all the folk here in W.A, basically what a union should be doing but with a more NS foundation,</p>
<p>Backed with a magazine similar to ZOO but completely politically incorrect and racialist...like the old bullitein, haha Ive no idea how</p>
<p>I'd manage any of that but it's what we need to recruit mining personell and establish the spirit of eureka in them. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>Probably missed a hundred points you made m8...we need an australiam section on fascism by country... I don't see anything that great happening anywhere else there is a country section for... Beside Brit &amp; Nordic country's..</p>
