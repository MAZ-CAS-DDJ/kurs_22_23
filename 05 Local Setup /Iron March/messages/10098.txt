<p>I have not read much Julius Evola unfortunately, I know everyone on the net likes him alot though so I need to read him sometime. I wouldn't say Hinduism influenced European religion, more that it comes from the same ultimate source, the PIE (Proto-Indo-Europeans). That religion of course we know nothing of, but Hinduism Hinduism is the oldest form of it that we know of. I think of Hinduism like a close cousin who is much older and therefore resembles the parent a little more.Â </p>
