<p>thank you for all your posts on this board.  I've been thinking, since that little furry incident the other day, and actually long before that.  They ran him out of town for his fantasies, his projecting what makes him comfortable on his own reality.  I'm glad we are short one furry, but really, looking at this board, i think many of them are guilty of using fascism or whatever brand of third positionism as the same thing.</p>
<p>hell, just go look into that uniform thread, half of them wanted to look like science fiction nazi cyborgs.  i'm becoming slightly disillusioned with the board, i will continue to post because there are some intelligent, down to earth posters here, such as you.  </p>
<p>so, thank you.</p>
<p>sincerely,</p>
<p>ferret.</p>

<p>Well, thanks for the praise, but I think that you'll find people out of touch with reality on every internet discussion forum.</p>
<p>As far as the furry incident is concerned, there's more to the picture than meets the eye. 2 admins including me stumbled upon Will to Power many personas about 6 months ago, totally by accident. I saw how he wreaked havoc for weeks in no less than 3 forums, and the pattern is always the same. The excuse is always being drunk, and the ending is always victimization, boo hoo I'm leaving, everybody hates me. Anyway. This kind of internet drama is of no interest.</p>
<p>As for the rest, I do agree with you. But I tend to be lenient regarding some people attitude which is often completely out of touch with reality, as in the uniforms thread you mentioned.</p>
<p>Let's keep in mind that most members of this forum are still at university or school, in their early 20's or below. I'm not being condescendant, but it is true to say that most of them have very little life experience when it comes to responsability, and knowing the consequences of our thoughts and actions. </p>
<p>You and me have one thing in common, you as a soldier and leader of men, and me as a mother. We are responsible for the well-being (physical and emotional) of other human beings. We know that the slightest fuck-up, the smallest moment of inattention can lead to grave consequences. I don't think I'm bragging if I say that this give us a real-life maturity that allows us to be more pragmatic and down-to-earth.</p>
<p>For some people here, the internet is the only place where they have a political life. And I hate to say it, but for most of them Fascism will just be a fad, and everything will be forgotten when they reach 40. Maybe not people such as Slavros or Ben...but most of them. TThey don't have real-life Fascist comrades, never went to a demonstration, never spent the night outside glueing propaganda stuff on the wall.</p>
<p>So yeah, some of them think this is some kind of Call of Duty or WoW game, heyyy let's play tough guys and dress up like Nazi Stormtroopers.</p>
<p>Personally I take this with a grain of salt. I once was a very young 18 years-old interested in politics but being completely out of touch with reality. So I'm not gonna cast the first stone to people behaving like I once did. And it is still enjoyable  to exchange views with people from over the world - and for me, to keep in touch with younger generations' mindset. I'm 42, their ways are not my ways, and I do think I also have things to learn from them, even if sometimes they sound overly idealistic. I still have my real-life comrades for  true activism...not online chat.</p>
<p>But I'm babbling.</p>
<p>I will conclude by saying that, as a soldier serving his country, you have my utmost respect. The writer Robert Heinlen once wrote that putting your mortal body between those you love and the enemy's bullets is the greatest act of love one can accomplish. I do agree with him.</p>
<p>Be well, best, WiB</p>
