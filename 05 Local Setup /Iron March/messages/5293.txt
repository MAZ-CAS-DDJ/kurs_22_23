<p>Thx for response and I confess to being a little surprised, although pleased, by your advice that many Iron Marchers are well traveled. I suspect, perhaps falsely, due to experience in the armed forces.</p>

<p>That avatar is one cool pic. Congrats.</p>

<p>I respect your ability to co-exist with the Jews and Arabs, up to a point, but, with your job in hand, I imagine that is part of the call of duty.  </p>

<p>I'm 54 and, although parents white Brits, have spent but 16 years there. Travel has definitely sculpted my attitudes and opinions, for better or worse. I imagine you've already formed an inkling of my take on the matter and I have certainly evolved into a firm Fascist with National Socialist tendencies.</p>

<p>I am in NJ and find the atmosphere somewhat stifling: outrageous taxes; Dems and Jews and "N"s all over the place; fucked up gun laws and...you get the drift.</p>

<p>One specific question for you, what is Boss Ross Futurism - is it related to the painter?</p>
