	Thank you for your interest, comrade! Most of us are in high school anyways as this *is* a youth movement after all. We do not have any members in your area so far but if you would like to take it upon yourself to recruit and distribute flyers around Madison that would be awesome. You are never too young to help the movement. If you do decide to help us, please make sure you follow these main rules
</p>

<ol><li>
		Only use our material or ask for permission before you use your own
	</li>
	<li>
		Do not go around telling random fags at school about Reaction because you can get fucked up
	</li>
	<li>
		Don't be a walking stereotype, please don't dress like a skinhead, try to look more like an actual Nazi
	</li>
	<li>
		Don't do anything illegal or threaten violence
	</li>
</ol><p>
	That's all, thank you for your support!
</p>

<p>
	Hail Victory!
