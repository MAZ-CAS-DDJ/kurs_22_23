<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>As you probably saw, I'm no longer an Admin, and I can't help you. I'm afraid you'll have to ask someone else. Good luck! WiB</p>

<p>Hi WiB,</p>
<p>This is Purple Slime Geek. I'm not sure if you know, but once before I managed to forget not only my account's password but the email address I had set up for it. Slavros had to go through a bunch of rubbish trying to sort out the problem for me.</p>
<p>So, guess what- I've done it again. Which is where the embarassment and foolish doltery comes in. :S</p>
<p>This is a big pain in the arse, I realise. I apologise. In my defence, however, I've just got back from overseas so my head is a little too full of Asia rather than the Internet at the moment.</p>
<p>Anyway... I was wondering if you could change the password on the other account for me so I could get back into it? I'd ask Slavros, but it was embarassing enough getting him to do it last time, haha, and you seem a little more forgiving. If you need confirmation that this <em>is</em> PSG, you can check my PMs- my last few were to American Blackshirt, discussing what I would contribute to the next issue of Reaktion. We'd discussed national-syndicalism a bit, as well as David Bowie (he asked if there was any veracity to the rumour that Bowie's mother was a BUF member). I ended up telling him I wouldn't be able to write the article because of my then-upcoming trip to Southeast Asia. Also I remember sending you a PM much further back when we had that influx of bonehead/Nazoid types into the forum.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for this, and apologies again for being a muddle-headed goon. If this is too much of a headache for you I'll just start a new account. Maybe call it Lavender Slime Geek. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>Thanks/apologies,</p>
<p>-PSG/Captain No-Brain</p>
