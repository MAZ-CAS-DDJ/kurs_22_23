<p>Thank you very much for your detailed response. The Philipine Phalanx looks particularly interesting. What's up with these Kombat Pilipinas-guys though? Are they serious? They look a bit clownish to be honest.</p>
<p>Your plans for your country look promising and well thought out. I do think it's a good idea to work with an existing nationalist movement. You can't do much as a lone wolf and founding yet another dwarf party does little good, it only further fragments the political landscape and nationalists everyhwere need above all one thing - unity. Also, you may have the chance to introduce your own ideas into the organization/party after some time.</p>
<p>I myself am determined to become more active this year. At the moment, I'm in contact with members of various nationalist organizations in Ukraine to see which ones are the best folks to work with.</p>
