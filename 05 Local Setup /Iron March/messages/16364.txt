	Take your time. Its a goal for the long-term. I'll be in the USMC for 4 years while my comrades work on the groups physical formation. For now this is a very loosely based project. It will take years to gather all the experience and intelligence that we will need to utilize - but that's what makes it fun. It takes a mans willpower and heart to make a commitment like this. How old are you btw?
