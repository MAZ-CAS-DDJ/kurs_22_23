<p>That's great brother! I'm close to graduating HS which will be in June, then I'm off to Westchester Community College in Valhalla NY (if you ever heard of it). Glad to hear your son is healthy and getting his Slav-size up to maximum Miroslav Stanislavovich Slavov size. </p>

<p>I am no longer in NYC thank the Gods, but it's not as great as you'd think where I live now. I mean it's only 40 minutes from the Bronx so there's still plenty of muds here. To be honest there's 10 times more kikes here than where I used to live, I mean niggers are niggers and spics are spics, but when there's a synagogue in every town it gets pretty aggravating. </p>
