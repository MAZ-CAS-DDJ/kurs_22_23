<p>Nothing has happened except his 'views'  on what I post.</p>
<p>I am a noise musician yes, a little over school age haha.</p>
<p>The issues I am coming across can be seen in all far right movements.</p>
<p>So much talk, so much derision of political parties that I have aligned my own ideologies with.</p>
<p>To say that I post shit just gets on my nerves. </p>
<p>I don't copy and paste just to appear knowledgeable(?)</p>
<p>I am looking for like minded people willing to act.</p>
<p>Not just talk.</p>
