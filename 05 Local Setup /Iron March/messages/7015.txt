Most of my posts aren't typically joking around, unless i'm trolling some faggot new member or that time we f*cked around in the esotericism thread for a bit (which was kind of hilarious).</p>

<p>When it comes down to it though, Tightrope has it's faults as well, and personally, i prefer Ironmarch to Tightrope. I hardly even check Tightrope anymore.</p>
