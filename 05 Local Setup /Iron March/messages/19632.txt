	Recently due to the media attention of IronMarch, and the whole incident with AW, I want to be precautionary. The US Government always tries to frame and set up Right Wingers. Its kind of pointless always posting or arguing with others in my opinion. I've met a lot of good people here and I'd rather spend time with them in person. I'm not leaving the site, but I'm just not going to post as much.
