<p>Fascism is third positionist. neither left and right. Just like Juche thought and the DPRK. Some think Fascism is leftist, though historically, both Fascism and Marxism come from the dialectical worldview. </p>

<p>Yeah, no. Both Communism and Fascism stem from a dialectical worldview, more specifically, the works of Hegel. Marxist critique of Hegelian dialectics led to dialectical materialism, whereas Fascist critique led to actual idealism. Again, look at proto-fascists such as Sorel who was also heavily influenced by Marx. Once Marxist ideology had established itself critiques of it, and of dialectics in general came from outside and within Marxist circles. This morphed into Fascism. The overwhelming majority of early Fascists came from what is thought of as "the left" (really just dialectical worldviews) with many being socialists, syndicalists, and Marxists. This diametric opposition you speak of has no real basis in the actual philosophy of those movements. It is when the raging, ignorant ideologues take over that those kinds of issues arise. Fascism and Marxism are two brothers bitching at one another over whose room is bigger.</p>
<p>Just because you do not like one form of socialism does not discredit what it is. There are a wide variety of "socialisms" out there that do not relate to Marx in anyway. Marx and, I think to a better extent, Engels crticism of what they deem Utopian and non-scientific forms of socialism are good critiques and well founded, but that doesn't alter the fact that those systems are inherently socialistic in nature and are de facto forms of socialism.</p>
<p>I've never called Stalin a "red fascist" as I think that term grossly misses the point. I've also never argued against the fact, within the Marxist-Leninist worldview, that socialism must be inherently international in scope in order to bring about the fall of capitalism. If you read what I say, I simply stated that the Stalinists viewed socialism in one country to be a much more efficient means of establishing the world revolution given the current world political climate at the time.</p>

<p>Say, opinions on the DPRK? Marxists usually despise the DPRK.</p>
<p>Just a rabid neo-con white zionist.</p>
