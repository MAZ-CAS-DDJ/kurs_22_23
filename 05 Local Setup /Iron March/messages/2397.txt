<p>I intend to inquire further onto your platform of national socialism; I will not do so in your introduction thread as it is an introduction thread &amp; nothing else.</p>
<p>As a man born in Germany &amp; an adherent of orthodox National Socialism(I am what your Strasser called a 'Hitlerite'), I carry a great amount of respect &amp; solidarity for your people. We fought together, although they were for different visions, goals &amp; reasons - we still fought together, and solidarity in battle is one of the most important bonds two cultures can share.</p>
<p>I'd like to inquire upon your opinion of orthodox national socialism, as opposed to left-Strasserism.</p>
