	In all honesty , I don't foresee a race war the progression of our society will be a continuous loop of capitalistic complacency and multiculturalism.

	Americans are too comfortable and I highly doubt there is an incoming system of collapse heading our way , instead I think hyper technology will eventually over take us.

	Fascism didn't triumph during World War II because the material circumstances were against it , the nations that poured their support into defeating it simply had more combined man power and resources and eventually defeated the fascist powers.

	The media isn't my concern ,my concern is people acting this way in general the basis that someone could be so disconnected with humanity that instead of taking a viewpoint like fascism , Islam, Christianity, Communism that defines clearly what it supports and what it considers to be worth destroying, these wackos decide to just kill everyone without a reason they aren't killing degenerates , infidels, bourgeoisie oppressors, but in their minds they are killing people humans , they enjoyment purely on the base act of killing their own species.

	Yes most obviously the white people exposed to high concentrations of low IQ minorities like blacks/hispanics in the United States will be more prone to developing racism on account of the failed state like surroundings and the high crime and general lack of intelligence of their non-white neighbors.
