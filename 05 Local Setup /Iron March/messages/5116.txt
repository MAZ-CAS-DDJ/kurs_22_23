<p>hehe, alright! I'm just starting to get the hang of sounding like a fascist. They seem to like short, negative comments the most. That, or start huge rants on 'niggers', 'fags' or 'sand monkeys', but even if I could make up rants about that I would refuse to do so... For now I'm sticking with defending Assad and hating Western leaders.</p>
