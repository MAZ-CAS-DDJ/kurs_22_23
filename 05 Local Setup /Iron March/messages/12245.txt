<p>No nothing new really. Just taking a lot of shit on here as you may know (check out the recent thread if you haven't already). Stefan was talking about gassing me again and only keeping me around because I am such a laugh. I am getting really sick of seriously trying to contribute and only getting laughed at, I get enough disrespect irl. I don't know do you have any advice? Or should I just stop posting for a while until thing die down again. Anyways, I am sorry but I am not familiar with Ck2 Conclave. What is that like? So, no progress on KOTOR then? Well anyways, it is good to hear you are doing well. Please let me know if you get this message.</p>
