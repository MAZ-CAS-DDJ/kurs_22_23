<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's been a long Aussie Day!  <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" />  Hope yours has been as solid as mine, had a nice relaxing one myself- beach in the morning, chilling at home with music &amp; books in the day, then beers with mates at a nearby park early evening. Probably an un-Aussie traitor for not having a proper BBQ &amp; proper piss-up, but still- I'm stoked. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_laugh.png" alt=":lol:" /></p>

<p>Your last msg- all really good points as usual, especially that stuff about European nationalism (good catch on their focus on fitness, important shit) &amp; some of the inadequacies of Aus First. I agree AF's overfocus on economic policies is problematic because for us as outright fascists that is too temporal, too focused on everyday politics &amp; policies &amp; not centred enough on a big-picture worldview, on deep-rooted values. As you said we should be totally open &amp; unashamed, declaring loudly that the way forwards is the application of the laws of nature (the Natural Order) to the human sphere of politics &amp; culture- natural hierarchy, promotion of strength, active isolation &amp; elimination of weakness, advocacy of the greater interests of the race and the nation that represents it above all. That means attacking anything opposing those values- which atm is parliamentary democracy, neo-liberal capitalism, cultural marxism, multiculturalism &amp; immigration. And yeah, NA tactics are fantastic, a great way of mobilising young people. Agree the magazine idea might be hard to pull off but I'm still excited by that idea and think that combining it with street activism (loudspeaker stuff, banners, stickers, leaflets, striking uni campuses, etc.) could be really effective.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That said, I did actually talk to Saleam today, he called me before me &amp; my mates went to the park. Tbh I was more impressed with him than I thought I'd be, was expecting a semi-sperg but he sounds a decent intelligent bloke. While I'm still not entirely sold on AF (van Tongeren's brass balls will always be no. 1), he did say a couple of things that were reassuring:</p>
<p>1. He does NOT think of AF as an electoral party. He straight-up told me he views the system itself as the enemy, not any political parties, and that while AF'll participate in some elections their primary strategy in future is NOT going to be based around winning votes. I think street activism is where he wants to take the party, but he didn't elaborate. Whether it will be aggressive enough for us IMers is another matter, no idea yet.</p>
<p>2. He did not say this outright, but I basically got the impression he agrees with our worldview. Reason he called me is because I posted on SF Downunder a defence of the IM view of fascism lately and he was very impressed by it- said he thought we were "on the same page" (didn't tell him I basically stole the idea from IM, lol).  Igot the feeling he is more NS-oriented than he lets on.</p>
<p>This could be problematic, because he doesn't openly declare AF an NS group; he <em>used</em> to be openly NS, then maybe dropped being open about it despite still holding the ideals, &amp; as we know the IM consensus on this is that it's Fucking Weak. I agree with that. But I'm hoping this will change- his conception of a return to Old Labor values <em>is</em> basically a home-grown Aussie version of NS if you think about it, even Tongeren made this link... and all AF'd need to do is stop pussyfooting around &amp; acknowledge this, become more openly radical, &amp; I'd be happy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the very least, this gave me the impression AF is not in the same vein as One Nation. It's definitely anti-system (meaning by extension anti-democracy), anti-Zionist (One Nation is Jew-friendly) and 100% racialist (One Nation is pro-refugee &amp; believes in assimilation). AF is still problematic in that it's not open enough about its beliefs &amp; tactics, it's still too policy-centred, Saleam might not be leadership material (we'll see when I meet him), and I seriously believe its propaganda needs work (its fucking website needs a real overhaul if they're going to appeal to young people, for instance). So it is a soft nationalist option, but not as soft as I thought- so long as Saleam wasn't stringing me a line. I am scheduled to meet up with some AF people &amp; am definitely going to. Whether I actually involvge myself with them or not, I'm still committed to autonomous or NA-style activism as my primary strategy &amp; after the talk with Saleam I don't think this will be contradictory, if anything they should be cool with supporting that. If they don't I'll fuck them off. Ideally I'd like AF become a bit more radical, then have an even more radical Aussie-NA complementing them, both cooperating yet operating in different spheres of activist activity. But that's just me dreaming...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyway, sure, let's meet up when you're down. Let me know a week in advance or so and we'll swap contact details. As for repealing the discrimination act, I'm not sure. I'll look it up when I have time. We'll need to have full knowledge of all anti-discrimination/racial vilification laws before we undertake any activism.</p>
