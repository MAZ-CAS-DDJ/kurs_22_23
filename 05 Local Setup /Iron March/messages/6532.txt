<p>Central Oklahoma, yeah, I used to live in Bethany and Norman for a few years, now i'm back in Lawton, which is my hometown. I still have loved ones up there, but i'm trying to get them and myself away from the cities, which will burn as things regress. I want to live out in the country, well protected and living a sustainable lifestyle, it's what I work for. You're definitely right; most Whites I know think pretty much as you and I do, but are waiting for the right time and the right circumstances to take action, which is prudent because we all have jobs and families after all. God Bless and protect you and yours, 'michaelarchangel'</p>
