	thank you, I send my condolences to you as well.Â did you do anything special to honor him? That thing about you guys climbing mt saint helen hit really close to home. I remember last summer me and him climbed some of the mountains in the Tahoe area, and that was really the last thing we did together I returned home from Ireland he was losing his ability to walk as well. Real heartbreaking he had a really sharp decline
