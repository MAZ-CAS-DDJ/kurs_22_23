	Its mostly due to religion. Poland was founded as a Catholic nation, and as Ashkenazi Jews began to settle in Polish communities, anti-semitism became prominent, since Jews were responsible for the death of our Lord Jesus Christ. Jews in Poland were always put in an apartheid situation. Jews and Poles did not associate with each other - and were often segregated in communities and universities.

	In the 1920's and 30's the antisemitic sentiment was huge in Poland. A lot of parties were formed similarly to the NSDAP such as the Polish National Democracy party and ONR in order to rid Jews. They never had any significant growth do to the authoritarian government (Sanacja) outlawing these movements. A lot of Poles also thought Communism was a Jewish plot to take over Europe, and a lot of these ideas came from our war with the Bolsheviks in 1919-1921. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BBydokomuna" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Żydokomuna</a>). During the Polish-Soviet war Polish soldiers actually committed pogroms because Jews were always eager to collaborate with the Red Army. We later saw this in WWII as well.

	Jews also love claiming how Poland helped with the Holocaust. I actually don't really deny this accusation. In fact I embrace it because my great-grandparents were Nazi collaborators. Poland's government is hellbent on denying any involvement with the Germans, but there are many incidents that are coming up now showing that Poles killed many Jews during the war. Just recently a kike published a book about how Poles in Jedwabne set a barn full of Jews on fire in 1941.
