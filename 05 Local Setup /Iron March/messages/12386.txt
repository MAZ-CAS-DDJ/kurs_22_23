<p>I've studied Odinism and have Odinist friends (one is actually a Priest in the OF), but I am not yet committed as an Odinist myself, although I find aspects of our old Pagan ways interesting and worthy of further study. May I ask what county or city in South East England you live in? I live in Horsham, West Sussex.</p>
