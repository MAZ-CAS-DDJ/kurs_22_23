<p>I would not worry about anti-semites.</p>
<p>True anti-semitism will never go away.</p>
<p>Do they hate Jews because they are bolsheviks or because they are capitalist? Traditionalist or internationalist? Being the basis of Christianity (and these people believe Christianity is evil), or... Being the basis of Christianity (and these others believe this means they are controling). Inventing something novel (monotheism), or borrowing from previous groups (although Christians also borrowed, but this is never discussed). Do they hate Jews because they have the highest IQs and have been one of the most intelligent groups and been able to exert disproportionate control? Or do they hate Jews because they are "inferior" to the genetic superiority of others? Because they are evil and Zionism "hurts palestinians," or because they are liberal humanists (apart of international finance ZOG) who give massive amounts of money to charities and aid programs?</p>
<p>You can never and you will never placate true anti-semites. They will dislike you for inventing something that they will decide is unnateral (monotheism?), or they will dislike you for borrowing from any pre-monotheistic cultures.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do is be politically savvy and not base your cause on anti-semites on the Internet, but rather on truth and morality. Because you can never and you will never win with the true anti-semites. They will oppose you for whatever you do.</p>
<p>Anti semites, if truth be told, have made me somewhat more religious. How can I be hated for whatever I do, simply for identifying with Judaism? The answer is possibly that God has indeed set Jews apart, and a greater level of morality is expected among Jews than any other people.... Therefore, the disproportionate expectations. Or that perhaps God is still punishing them. Maybe that is an existential conspiracy, I do not know.</p>
<p>The irony in this is that anti-semites also hate Jews for being chosen or thinking they are chosen. But all their previous views suggest that Jews ARE chosen. Anti-semitism is a self-perpetuating machine, and I do not really know what can be done about it other than ignoring it.</p>
<p>Although, if you ignore it too much... Then genocide.</p>
