	No offense, but for me that looks the same paranoid victim complex / PTSD the Jews are having. Same thing with the Vatican. I don't know your position on that, but today the Vatican just don't give a shit about Serbia, you are simply not that important (especially now when they are losing even the traditionally Catholic countries). We have the same kind of paranoids among Hungarian Chauvinists, who are thinking that the whole world has a secret plot for destroying the Hungarian people, but that's just ridiculous. It was the interest of the West (which is not the Vatican btw) to crush the greater power blocs in our region like Austria-Hungary or Yugoslavia, but that's already done, and the rabid hate between the successors of these entities are their most effective tool to keep us in our present weak state. Never think for a minute that the same powers wouldn't have helped Serbia against the NDH, as that would be another threat to their status-quo of small and isolated states.

	I am sure that most of the Croats just don't care about Serbs. Yes, they don't like you, but the Serbs are much more obsessed with that hate against them than the other way around. I guess they want to unite with the FBH, but that's it. On a broader scale that's really just silly to see them as a demonic threat to your existence. Every nation is disintegrating, not because of outer enemies, but because of inner weakness (well, with the exception of Kosovo in your case ofc*). Every war waged against other nations will strengthen the inner enemies by giving them new possibilities to again come out from the conflict as the 'laughing third'.

	* By the way, shouldn't you focus more on the Albanian problem? Most of the Geopolitical researchers see Greater Albania as something what would likely become a reality in the following years.
