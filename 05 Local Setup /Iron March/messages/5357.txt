<p>Good evening. I have been thinking about your post on your fb page today regarding Martin Luther &amp; the parental influence in Saudi &amp; Iran. I intended to comment to that post but see you have taken it down.  If I may, an opinion here as I found it interesting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I do agree with you regarding Luther having been forged in the political environment of northern Europe of the 16th C. I would add that the other great philosophers of the century, Erasmus, More &amp; Bacon were also, regardless of what one feels of their opinions. True, Machiavelli was southern European but he was dealing with political upheaval with the de Medicis. I would also add William Tyndale to the grouping for, while not a philosopher, anyone who is credited as being the written source of 75%+ of the material for arguably the greatest and most influential book in the English, if not in all, language, the King James Bible, deserves inclusion. In my mind there is the possibility that he is more important than Luther.</p>

<p>Where I am in 2 minds is upon your references to Saudi and Iran. I do concur that their societies are closeted and the parental influence is key. However, I feel that the very environment of uncertain politics that forged a few persons such as Luther 5 centuries ago, does apply in Saudi, Iran and other countries such as Pakistan.  Surely, it is the political and societal structure that can bring one to question their religious belief, particularly if that ideology is inherently biased and to some extent morally corrupt? To me, the most constructive aspect of Islam is an abhorrence towards usury.  The questioning of the dominant religion is also coupled with the societal turmoil, best seen in Pakistan and then Iran, but also in Saudi, from grossly unequal, corrupt, political environments that do little to consider the worker, tradesman and small entrepreneur. </p>
