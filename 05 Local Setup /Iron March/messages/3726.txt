<p>You made a comment in the "Your favourite other nation" thread regarding the spiritual inferiority of Russian Orthodoxy vs. (presumably) other Eastern churches. I asked you to explain how this was so, and never got a response. Was it just because you didn't have anything to add to Broneiztrebitel's assessment? Even then, his criticisms applied to the Church across the whole former Socialist Bloc, not just Russia.</p>
