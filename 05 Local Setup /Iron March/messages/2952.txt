<p>My first introduction to Jews in politics was Jewish Task Force ffs, far right as all hell, I never bought the Jews are cultural marxists bullshit. I also just happen to agree with you a lot and you have a good sense of humor. The stupid ZOGklaxons on this site piss the living shit outta me.</p>
