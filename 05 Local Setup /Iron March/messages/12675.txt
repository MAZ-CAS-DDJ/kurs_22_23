<p>Shalom, fellow chosen one and Commiefornian.</p>
<p>I'm a PNW native, but I'm stuck in the asshole of the state at the moment (near Sacramento).  So I'm not from Socal.  But I'm absolutely interested in supporting your group.  If you have anybody up here, I could network with them too.  I hold the same philosophy as your group.  I believe in legitimate action instead of masturbation and complaining on the internet.  I also support networking and setting up connections with likeminded people to advance our positions in government and elsewhere (fifth column).</p>
<p>I'm in marine NROTC at the moment.  I'm still in training and I go to OCS next year, but I could probably bring those skills and tactics to the table in the future if you're interested.</p>
<p>You goys have a skype chat (or tox, or whatever)?</p>
