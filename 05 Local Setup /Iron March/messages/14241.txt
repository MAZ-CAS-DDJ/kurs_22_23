	I wouldn't worry too much about it, they'll make their mind up after they've seen you (already being on here means you're good :D)<br />
	I'd have told them about you by then, I might be there for your meet so it'll all be super cosy c;<br />
	Also, for the meet you might have to go to the opposite side of London (or central) to meet them but it should be made in near central if that's closer. It'll cost you like £5-£10 in tube fares
