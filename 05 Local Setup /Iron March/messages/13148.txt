			I am assuming those documents are not in the public domain?
		</p>

		<p>
			To publish this information I would have to disclose the original source.
		</p>

		<p>
			Otherwise I could get into trouble.
		</p>

		<p>
			What do you think?
		</p>

		<p>
			When time permits I will try to dig up more on those people and groups.
		</p>

		<p>
			Will see if there is anything on record implicating them.

	All of these documents are in the public domain, I have just taken the time to compile them comprehensively.Â  They can be used without you getting sued.
