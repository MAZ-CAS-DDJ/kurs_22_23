	Alright thanks! I will have to look into memrise when I can and maybe pick up <em>Italian for Dummies </em>when it can. Like I said it might be a while ( maybe a couple years tbh) because I have my hands full with starting to learn German this semester. (My uni doesn't offer Italian). Thanks for the advice. Also, what kind of e-mail? Just identify myself as an American Fascist?
