	Sounds good. I imagine it'd be best to meet about halfway between our locations. Also if you have any restaurant suggestions, let me know. I'm not picky, and idk where you're at exactly. I imagine you can tell me an approximate address for a median point between our locations (so that I can browse the restaurants in the area and you can avoid posting your location on here, if you don't want to).
