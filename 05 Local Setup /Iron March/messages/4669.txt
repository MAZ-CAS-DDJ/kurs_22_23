<p>Pardon the slow reply, been in transit and getting settled back into civilization the past couple weeks.</p>
<p>And yeah, I did wonder about that bible passage a while back too, but unfortunately... How many women are virgins past their teens these days, seriously?</p>
<p>Anyways, actually, I could probably hook you up with some manuals from the Marine Corps side of things, if you don't have them already. I'd need to skim around the library and online manuals a bit when time permits, though. Also, do you have the full SERE manual? If not I can easily get all the PDF files. Great stuff to know, for sure. There's also some more specific SERE manuals geared towards survival in different climate zones and environments, which are great once you've read the big fat main one.</p>
<p>Weaponry and shooting manuals I could also easily get. There's an online series of classes called MCI's Classes (Marine Corps Institute). While you won't have access (or any need really) to the tests we take for promotion brownie points, the manuals sometimes have some good stuff. There's a lot of useless shit for more administrative jobs, then there's cooler MCIs about Nuclear-Bio-Chemical warfare/survival, weaponry and so on. You can view the course catalog here: <a href="https://www.mci.usmc.mil/LandingZone/courseCatalog.aspx" rel="external nofollow">https://www.mci.usmc.mil/LandingZone/courseCatalog.aspx</a> </p>
<p>If any of those strike your fancy, let me know and I can get the PDFs.</p>
