<p>Well firstly I would like to thank your politeness and tact. The warning I issued to you was done more in annoyance and in a bad mood. I haven't really been posting lately as I had a family emergency beginning last week.<br /><br />Now would I promote racial ideas in a 100% white country? Maybe not as pronounced (because it wouldn't have to be, given such a lack of contrast within the populous), but I would certainly advocate for safeguards against too much cultural and ethnic displacement. It is rather difficult to imagine where you're coming from being from Slovenia, and me from the country renowned for being the "city on the hill", the "(s)melting pot", etc. I have actually had to grow up in not only a country with heaping loads of "diversity" but a shell of a nation that has a state that seeks to trample on any attempt at a true ethnic identity. So yes, my racial feelings are a bit pronounced and may come off angrier than intended, as it seems to be with my fellow Anglo's.<br /><br />I completely understand that Catholicism and Orthodoxy in the Mediterranean, Balkans, and Slavic worlds have held onto a firm tradition that supports ethnic identity without necessarily turning into National Socialism. It is a good thing, I believe. However, us in the more "Western" world (i.e. Nordic/Anglo) have had a rather worse run with Protestantism and I believe the anti-Christian reaction in our movement is a legacy of Enlightenment Protestant stupidity. We still have many things in common with Catholic social doctrine but the way Christianity has devolved in our sphere is probably what leaves some of us with a bad taste in our mouths. Frankly, I'm not quite sure of the solution.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for the message. I wouldn't want to beat a dead horse by posting in that thread either.</p>
