<p>Could you kindly direct me to any? I'm trying to get a better handle on Jewish nationalism due to the current conflict in Gaza, and I would be interested to hear your recommendations.</p>
<p>Also, have you ever read Herzl's 'The Jewish State'? I'm thinking about getting a copy.</p>
<p>Cordially,</p>
<p>Dux</p>
