<p>Yeah, I started it at the begining of November, 2010, at 215(ashamed to say), dropped to 170 by last April(2011), steady there since. I've been stricter on it at times than at others, but overall it's amazing; the fact you're not losing out on any good food, either, says something. I can't understand why more people don't jump in, aside from not wanting to give up the convinience of bread, pasta, and chips.</p>
<p>What happened to your food situation? My job pays shit, and I live in the most highly taxed and worst paid parts of this country, so I understand somewhat. Trying to get affordable pasture-fed meat, not happening. Lucky I can afford salad dressing w/ out soybean oil in it, let alone sticking with italian sausage over hot dogs, or getting fresh fish through the week. Living alone, it gets even worse because most meat comes in family pack, and I don't want chicken breast 6 times a week and I don't want it going bad. Not to mention, the lack of offal.</p>
<p>So, what's this warrior diet? Cool name, but can it live up to the primal standard?</p>
