<p>No prob, that it is. I'm probably on the more left-leaning third-position like yourself, I've been gradually moving right recently, so I joined this site and looked for things relating to Juche, which I consider similar to my own position. I don't like it's use in North Korea, though, perhaps the government is too corrupt? Not enough Confucian ethics embraced? Well, all I know is that it isn't working well. </p>
<p>Eh, I don't like using forums very much, I prefer facebook (simpler and more straightforward) but I'll stick here. Explain yours more, are you often around leftists outside of this forum?</p>
