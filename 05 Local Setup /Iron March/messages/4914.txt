<p>Good. I lost faith in you for a while.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nature punishes those who do not obey its laws. One can call this "Gods work" but I do not like the term "God". When I hear the term "God" I think of Yahweh/Allah. Replace "God" with nature and I mostly agree with you. I feel the theological differences between atheism, agnosticism, pantheism, desism is very little. It is mostly just schematics. Being an atheist or agnostic would not be incompatible with a certain view on reincarnation or ghosts. One could technically be an atheist and be a flat earth theorist that rejects evolution.</p>
