	Lucky you America isn't your home , I;m pretty much stuck here , honestly I was thinking about living in the woods but it would take evading lawÂ enforcement and the government, so if I was going to live in the woods northern Canada or Patagonia would be better choices since America is in effect a surveillance state.
