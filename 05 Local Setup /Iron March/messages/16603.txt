	Hello. I am the Whiteraven and I fell obligated to tell you about how to not multipost. When you are looking replies pres the + button by quote and that way it stores whatever you're quoting. When you are done doing that just press where it says quotes stored and when you reply you will have all their replie in one post instead of multiple posts.
