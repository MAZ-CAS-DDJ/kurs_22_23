<p>Apologies for the time; I did not get an email notification that you sent something. Regardless, I agree that it is a shame that there aren't! It's absurd to think that Fascism can exist absent intellectualism. I fail to see how it being a Fascist intellectual is impossible. I agree on the second front as well; having physical strength but not being able to win an argument or have any theoretical framework for your beliefs is like building a cathedral with no foundation; it will fall. But I digress, I think you make valid points.</p>

<p>The university you attend has no continental philosophy?? Where on Earth is this place? (You obviously don't need to share the specific school, I'm just curious as to what region of the world)</p>

<p>To move your  post-script up here, of course you can add me. And do you have any questions for me, or what would you like to talk about?</p>
