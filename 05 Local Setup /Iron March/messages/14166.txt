	Absolutely man, I love nature. I mean, being NS and all it kind of fits the bill so to speak and a Heathen to boot. I am really looking forward to being out there, I make the best of Alberta. But BC is so much cleaner and nicer to be in, I am going to feel at home.

	I am quite fanatic with my views, and I do stand with folk, faith and family. However I respect other races, and I am always highly interested in talking to other races who either do believe in NS values or even just simple fascism. I'm not a redneck skinhead who's all about White Power fuck non-Whites and getting piss drunk. I cut those types out of my life, because they're worse degenerates than a foreigner who comes here to work and is productive to society. The topic of mixing is always sensitive to anyou NS person. To me, whatever. You are a product of your parents, miscegenation happened, it isn't ideal for someone with my personal views. But at least you believe in fascism and i'm sure carry yourself as a decent human being. So I have no quarrel with that.
