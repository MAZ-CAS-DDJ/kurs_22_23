<p>Hello. </p>
<p>There was a meeting between Dugin and a GD delegation last week. Is this guy really a Putin advisor or is this a hype by his circles (which in Greece are a really dubious bunch). From what i came across through some little net lurking, is that this guy is fucking ludicrous. He held a speech at Piraeus university some months ago where he stated that Russia could see a potential ally in...SYRIZA party(leftists). </p>
<p>I've noticed that you have a really negative attitude about him. I wonder what is that so... Is it because of his position regarding the Russian Question or something. For certain, it must be an opinion formed by inside information in Nationalist circles in Russia about the guy. What we get in Greece is a wide-spread Putin-cult (Putin the delegate of God and savior of Orthodocksy) in the populace by various sources and that results in some people getting more credit and status than they deserve.</p>
