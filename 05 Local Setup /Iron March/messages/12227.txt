<p>On 2 February 2008, Golden Dawn planned to hold the annual march for the twelfth anniversary of the Imia military crisis. Anti-fascist groups organised a protest in order to cancel the march, as a response to racist attacks supposedly caused by Golden Dawn members. Golden Dawn members occupied the square in which the march was to take place, and when anti-fascists showed up, clashes occurred. During the riots that followed, Golden Dawn members were seen attacking the anti-fascists with riot police doing nothing to stop them and actually letting them pass through their lines. This led to two people being stabbed and another two wounded by rocks. There were allegations that Golden Dawn members even carried police equipment with them and that Golden Dawn's equipment was carried inside a police van.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_%28political_party%29#cite_note-91" rel="external nofollow"><span>[</span>91<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_%28political_party%29#cite_note-92" rel="external nofollow"><span>[</span>92<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Mainly what happened at Dover last week. Antifascists tried to play tough (in a ratio to 3 to 1) with police and the state indirect support and managed to get their asses kicked and be look like complete cucks and then with some camera manipulations and a week long bitching in the media about "ebil nahtzees stabbing peaceful protesters with the aid of the police".</p>

<p>There is a political background as well that I will not expand in details since that topic deserves an article in itself. The ND government tried to be a bit independent and make some openings towards Russia. So there were many destabilization attempts to overthrow that government and make it look bad with scandal leaks that escalated through time with the crescento of the december 2008 riots.In that case it was an attempt of the government to cover up a controversial sex scandal that was really hot at that period. So they in fact and guided the events in a way that a clash occured and they could portray it in such a way that it would be controversial and could serve as media bait...SYRIZA made a big part in this since many factions of it orchestrated the counter-demo (SYRIZA then was a little shitty party of 3%). So the government got it's disorentation from the scandal and syriza managed to play as victim in the media. It was a cooperation of left and right against Nationalists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So that was it in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Oh btw if you can change the paragraph a bit. I think it would be a lot better if it could go like this.</p>

<p>Things were tense and fiery two weeks before the gathering. The antifa scum announced a counter-demo (as they always do) at the original meeting place at Vasilissis Sofias Avenue near the Parliament. It seems they didn't get the message of 2008, when the AFA scum tried to pull a number with the states backing and got their asses kicked ending up to be portrayed as complete cucks at the gain of their overlords (and ours since the gave us a glorious victory on the street, an event to be remembered for years to come)!</p>
<p>After all as the events unfolded this year, they proved themselves as dumb as hell since they didn't take their overlords wishes and ended up looking more faggier than ever (since the system didn't even let them have an "honorable" defeat) and as the useful idiots of the system to any person with a brain in his head.</p>

<p>I think it's better since it really makes them look like complete retards, and make us look smarter than them since we can win battles without even having to give them.</p>
