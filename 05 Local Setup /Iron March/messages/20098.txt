	Thanks. I've lurked a while and seen that many people sign up without actually bothering to research Fascism and what it stands for.

	As for America, I do not and really have never considered myself a part of the USA. As I said in my intro post, I have always found the whole "muh freedums" "America FUCK YEAH" thing that the Conservatives and Alt-Right do to be really stale and hollow. America is not a real nation and the sooner that the Jewish state apparatus gives out, the sooner we can have a real chance at establishing the Fascist Worldview on the North American continent.
