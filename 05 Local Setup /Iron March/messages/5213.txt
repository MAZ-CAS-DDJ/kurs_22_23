<p>Hello Aleksandr, it is me Joshua Komarov. I have created a new account as the other one I could not post with. I didn't want to hide my identity so am coming out saying who I am now. </p>
<p>If for some reason you removed my posting abilities on the other account, please know I will stop posting whatever you didn't like. Please give me another chance, I like the forum and the people in it as well as posting with them. </p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Blood_of_Patriots/Joshua Komarov </p>
