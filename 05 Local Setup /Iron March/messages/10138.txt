<div>Herman's Saga</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>Arminius the Romans called him</div>
<br /><div>Hermann in his fathers tongue</div>
<br /><div>Waded he through sword-storm and forests grim</div>
<br /><div>And battle-stories worthy to be sung</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>A slave he was, a thrall to Rome</div>
<br /><div>In shame he served them faithfully </div>
<br /><div>But under grassy knolls no one knows </div>
<br /><div>What wights plan their demise </div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>Learned he their ways, the forms and tactics </div>
<br /><div>With spirit of Wotan he learned the ways of Mars </div>
<br /><div>Quiet and polite, he strove upwards in rank </div>
<br /><div>Till none trusted more than him </div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>In Balkan wars he proved himself </div>
<br /><div>A warrior worthy of Caesar-king </div>
<br /><div>Trade gift for gift, he gave them victory </div>
<br /><div>Trade lie for lie, he gave them false hope</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>Time ran short, the greedy wolf ate </div>
<br /><div>Like Rome's teeth the soldier's marched onward</div>
<br /><div>Feasting on German forests like it had in Gaul</div>
<br /><div>Time ran short, the noble-man planned</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>Hawk-clever the German thought </div>
<br /><div>His mind as swift as lightning </div>
<br /><div>Went he in secret to his father's tribe </div>
<br /><div>And spoke with the Earl's and Haruskozii many</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>Brand kindled brand, for days the Thing lasted </div>
<br /><div>Much mead and ale was drunk </div>
<br /><div>His father's shrines did Hermann pray</div>
<br /><div>For victory and glory </div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>From across the forests the tribes did come </div>
<br /><div>Tiwazii, Chatti, Bructari, Hauci, Sicambri many </div>
<br /><div>Banners many did fly, god-poles stood tall from many shrines</div>
<br /><div>Old feuds were buried, they became one </div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>With lies and cleverness Hermann did lead </div>
<br /><div>His former masters astray </div>
<br /><div>Deep into the lake of forests, far too deep</div>
<br /><div>Till I ween that none could pull them out</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>Their sandals muddied, their horses tired </div>
<br /><div>They stretched out, like a serpent on forest-ground</div>
<br /><div>Slithered they into Germany</div>
<br /><div>Knowing not what eyes did watch them </div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>Long their host became, thinner than snake</div>
<br /><div>Hermann knew to strike </div>
<br /><div>Like sword-waves they crashed upon Roman metal </div>
<br /><div>And carved through like eagles </div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>For 3 days did they battle, long and bloody </div>
<br /><div>Axes stooped, eagles screamed, Harri cried out to their gods </div>
<br /><div>A red day, a spear day, a shield day</div>
<br /><div>Many splinters were made, many swords shattered </div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>Valkyries flew across the skies, giving madness to men</div>
<br /><div>"Freedom or death!" Cried the Suebians, </div>
<br /><div>Chanted they praises to Thurisaz and Tiwaz</div>
<br /><div>Wodanaz greatest of all, the hanged god gave them gladness in war </div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>Knew he not victory, Varus in shame</div>
<br /><div>Flung himself upon his sword </div>
<br /><div>Better die with honor, better die with men </div>
<br /><div>Than go home a coward</div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>The all-father did give victory to Herman</div>
<br /><div>His tribes and people were saved, I ween</div>
<br /><div>Many skulls were nailed, much armor was hacked </div>
<br /><div>Many men hung on sacred trees, many more buried in blessed bogs</div>
<br /><div>The gods were pleased, gift begets gift </div>
<br /><div> </div>
<br /><div>Retreated the children of Mars back to Rome</div>
<br /><div>In gladness did the Germans sing</div>
<br /><div>Till crushed with hammer was Herman's dome</div>
<br /><div>Too much power he wanted, to much did he cling</div>
