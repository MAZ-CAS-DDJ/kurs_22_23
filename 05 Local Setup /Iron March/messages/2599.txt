<p>While all these philosemitic nutjobs here certainly freak me out, I'm much more appalled by all these low-lifes for whom ideology seems to be nothing but a fashion statement, an accessoir to make them look "cool" or "badass". Don't get me wrong, this hardly applies to all of the ironmarch-users, not even the majority, but certainly to some of the most loudmouthed.</p>
<p>Yes, I am Ukrainian. The GDR was just as bad as any other communist terror regime and from what I have read, the eastern parts of Germany still bear some scars from that time (wrecked economy, high unemployment etc.). Communism is a disease and any commie, no matter if he is a typical left-winger or one of these nazbol-fuckers, should be locked away. Luckily, I was born just after the soviet union collapsed. However, in Ukraine today the power is mostly held by different kinds of mobsters and oligarchs so in the end, not too much has changed sadly enough.</p>
<p>I definitely agree with you on that one. It also proves once more that Adolf Hitler was far from being the monster he is portrayed as nowadays but quite the contrary - a sophisticated man who genuinely cared for his nation as well as for his loved ones. Sure, NS Germany had a lot of flaws, but Hitler was, at least in my eyes, not responsible for any of them. All the flawed aspects of NS policy (such as e.g. the irrational hatred for the Slavic peoples) can be traced to equally flawed characters, e.g. Himmler.</p>

<p>Fashion Fascists, yes, I know what you're talking about there. The trendy type..there's quite a few "prominent" members on this board who I think fall under that category. When I say prominent, I refer to as far as the adminship. It's..really frequent these days, I've seen. The usage of the aesthetics to make ones' self look 'badass' &amp; 'stylish'. </p>
<p>The GDR was brutal; when I was young, you'd regularly hear of GDR secret police/NKVD shooting random civilians who attempted to find ways around the wall. This was especially common in Stettin, where people would try to take boats off the coast in order to reach the Western end, by just shipping themselves to that coastline. They'd be dead in the water - literally. Communism is indeed a disease and I find myself hating the nazbol faggots you referred to more than many of them..it's..so disgusting, tying a Hammer &amp; Sickle into the Reichs' flags' format. There are very few times I've more intensely wanted to send someone to the chambers than when it comes to observing national-bullshitvikism. </p>
<p>Adolf Hitler was certainly no monster; the man was extraordinarily emotional, and extraordinarily pragmatic. He knew the reality of moralism, though, and knew the reality of certain ethics - like egalitarian ethics, and accepted these realities..and also accepted the reality of the Human food chain, and intended - more than anything - to place Germans atop that food chain. Regarding the anti-Slavic tendencies of sorts like Himmler...I honestly find Himmler to be a coward. The same with Goering. I hate them both, with so much ferocity. I am not concerned with hating Slavs, nor conquering Slav land.</p>
<p>I am concerned with conquering German land colonized by Slavs, like Polish Prussia or places like the Kaliningrad Oblast. As far as I'm concerned - most Slavs are basically brothers to Germanics. We are the two strongest peoples in Europa..although I can't say I'm too fond of the Polish, regardless of everything. They..I just don't really find myself liking them all that well. </p>
<p>How do you feel about Ukrainian Russophilia?</p>
