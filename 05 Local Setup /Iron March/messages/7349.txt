<p>My father was in Peru few weeks ago too, he goes there every year because he knows some shamans there and they try different drugs there, he was telling me a lot about this drug: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca</a></p>

<p>I organized a lot of things lately, I got me and other guys from our crew a free gym during the summer where we train boxing daily. Some of our guys had professional fights and all that, there's a lot to learn and we have trainings every day monday till friday. Really good atmosphere because 80% of us are "right wing" (ie. NS/fascist), we also invited some experience MMA fighters and jiu jitsu guys so it's a bit more diverse. We even had free fitness for entire month. I'm happy that I got some more serious guys from our scene together, NS/hooligan people I hang out usually are more like drinking buddies. Too bad you can't see what a strong crew we have now.</p>

<p>I started experimenting with being straight edge, I eat healthy now and abstain from alcohol and other shit, I'm really happy with the results. I won't live like this forever and obviously I'll drink a beer here and there, but it's very good so far, I was never in such a good shape, not even near.</p>

<p>I like it how in Eastern Europe modern generation of neo-NS is full of people who are all about sports and martial arts. That's why I posted you that video. This "dedushki moroza" group attracted tons of fans and sympathizers even though they're openly Nazi simply because they look cool to every teenager who's not a total faggot. They've done more for the scene than all those new right intellectuals put together. We're trying to be similar, promote martial arts to young people, train for free if it's needed, just to get the right guys from younger generation on our side.</p>
