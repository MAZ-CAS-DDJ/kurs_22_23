<p>Don't forget that a large (but unstated) purpose of the introduction is to judge the character of new members. So we haze them. If they get emotional and start sperging, then we filter them out early. This hazing process is important, and allows us to get rid of undesirables. Of course the new guys are young, they can still learn and change their views, but only if they are on the forum with the right attitude - and if their world view is full of shit, then the right attitude is humility.</p>
