<p>I hadn't heard of the APP, interesting stuff mate, that I think has some relevance in present Australia.  That is what I gathered about the AFP from what I've heard from over east, they are virtually unknown in the west, so I only hear half the story with them, the Integral Nationalism document Saleam Published is rather agreeable. I guess, what good are these political parties without a coherent worldview/cause of honor, duty and responsibility to Blood and Soil and an aim to smash the Jewish Cultural Revolution...They'll just render our folk as useless as they were under early labour.. </p>
