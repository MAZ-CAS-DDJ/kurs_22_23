<p>I thought that once, in addition being white makes it more difficult. But Mexican-americans(the non-degenerate ones) are more well spoken, charismatic, and educated. They crave for true leadership, although we speak with semi-American accents, they are still drawn by our charisma. I made a short speech once as a guest speaker, and believe it or not I rallied them up. While I see what you mean, a national synarchist falangist state in Mexico would eliminate degeneracy, restore order, and end corruption. As a result you would a legitimately 21st century falangist state, which I believe would be appealing to traditionalists, conservative revolutionaries, falangist a and various White Latin Americans. </p>
<p>Civil war is coming, all that's needed is the spark. And you right, the vigilantes are not only untrust worthy but cowards as well. What's needed is a nationalist paramilitary group that will fight both the cartels and government. </p>
