<p>yeah, I agree. Its part of what pushed me into heathenism. I think its a shame that our children grow up hearing the stories of some ancient Jewish tribe instead of the heroes of their own past. Im infinitely happier that I grew up reading Tolkien and mythical stories as opposed to the Bible. At the same time I understand the general attachment to Christianity in the far right, and I mean, Jesus does kinda say that the Jews are wicked liars and descend from Satan instead of God. Another thing I dislike about American Christians is most have never really read they Bible, they rely on what their Jew-slave pastors tell them. Early European Christianity was alright, at least they were strong then.</p>
<p>With America though its especially difficult because most in America have no connection to their European roots and some even kinda look down on Europe and think America is some chosen people nation like the Jews. They seriously see themselves as closer to the Jews and blacks than to their own brothers and forefathers, its disgraceful. Im really unsure as to what to do, to change a whole nations mindset is easier said than done. However lately people are becoming more and more jaded and detached from the system, thats really our best bet for converting people. People with nothing vested in society wont care about us wanting to remake it.</p>

<p>alright, ill look into any you send me! im a little busy studying some occult texts of my own though. some of them are like whole textbooks and require advanced math to understand, and I suck at math. Im okay I guess haha, ive been improving lately though. Im pretty decent at woodcarving though, Ive made a couple things for my shrine from that. yeah pol is a big crapheap nowadays. back in the early days it was pretty amazing however, alot of the start of the nationalist movements right now have their roots in early /pol/. problem is theres tons of shills on there, and always have been. yeah ive tried talking to my family about these things and they either just ignore me or laugh like im an idiot with no clue what im saying. they never refute anything I say, and when they do I reply and shut them down. its starting to get frustrating, especially since theyre my own blood. when I told my mother about the rotherham "scandal" she just got mad that I was implying immigration is bad and muslims arent compatible with our society, and started screaming (seriously) about the move braveheart and how english men raped scottish women, so because the british are evil that makes it okay</p>
<p>I told her that was a movie and theres no records of the king-virgin-rape thing ever happening in europe except places where the turks and moors occupied it and she just stormed away all pissed at me</p>

<p>yeah, i dont see them much unfortunately but I love the south as well. the forests and orchard lands are beautiful, makes you want to wander and read books. I hate sounding like a hippie but I like nature alot, guess it goes with being pagan. america is honestly a beautiful land, I hope we dont have to give it up in the race war. I can see why the redskins liked it so much lol. dont worry, they do indeed squat. last time I fought a slav he went into squatting position, threw me off balance and knocked me out. theyre crafty.</p>
