<p>Well, mma will definitely slow down your gains because it cuts into your recovery time. But you can still do it, just try not to do the "conditioning" they sometimes get you to do, which will really fuck with your strength training (because it's making your muscles try to adapt to contradictory stresses ie. strength vs endurance).</p>

<p>Yeah, running out of food is going to be a problem. Ground beef is your best friend. A common tip is also to drink a gallon of milk (3-4% milk, not skim crap)  a day. If you tolerate milk well, this is great (milk has lots of protein, lots of fat, lots of carbs, lots of calories). Milk is cheap. I have no problem drinking a lotta milk, but a friend of mine got diarrhea. You can add some flavor to the milk if you think it's gross.</p>

<p>For shakes, you don't even have to add protein powder if you don't want to. Milk, cream bananas, eggs, frozen fruit, yogurt, and many others, are ingredients that don't cost much and will give you plenty of nutrition (calories and protein).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can also get creative to add calories to what you're already eating. Dip your pizza in olive oil. If you cook veggies, add a bunch of butter to the pan, the vegetables just soak it up like a sponge. You get my drift.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ultimately, what matters is that you're adding weight to the bar on every session. If you're not stronger from one workout to the next, something's wrong.</p>
