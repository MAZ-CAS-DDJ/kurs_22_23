<p>I've got a small group of National Socialists, centered in and around Warrington, mostly in our twenties. Bright, decent lads too; no idiots, no dickheads. We're all massive fans of The Greatest Story Never Told. We'd be willing to meet up with you some time for a drink and a chat, if you were up for it.</p>
