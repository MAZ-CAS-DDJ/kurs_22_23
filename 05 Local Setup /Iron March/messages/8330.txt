<p>hey, i really like your graphic design work.  let me know if you ever want constructive criticism, although it looks like you are honing your skills very quickly.</p>
<p>i've also got this idea, to figure out which print-on-demand shirt shops will allow our designs (most have user agreements explicitly stating they wont allow our type of message, although so does tumblr kek) and then sell stuff with all proceeds going to Azov Battalion or similar fronts.  i did research on this awhile ago and came across one shirt service run by a libertarian who would probably just shrug.  he was technically the most promising option.  </p>
<p>unfortunately antifa/zog types will eventually harass such projects if they get off the ground, although maybe we could network with various small outfits that already are doing fascist clothing production and get it done one country/region at a time or something.</p>
<p>my computer is acting up but later tonight ill send along an imgur album of stuff ive thrown together in the past.  ive also focused on vector graphics but i need to expand into other software and techniques.</p>
