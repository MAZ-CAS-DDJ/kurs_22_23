It was exploring my German heritage that lead me to Germanic branches of paganism.<br /><br />I live in Central California at the moment, although my wife and I are looking into relocating somewhere more white and less liberal. What's it like in Oregon? I've only been there once, about 20 years ago, in the Klamath Falls area.  </p></div>

<p>Oregon can be very white, though i would advise the southern half of Oregon for the less liberal side of the state.<br /><br /><br /><br />i am part greek, though mostly Scottish and German. i have just always had a close relationship with the Greek part of my heritage, and i feel closely connected to the gods of ancient Greece.<br /><br /><br /><br />back to oregon, the town i live in, tri-city (its in douglas county, one of the larger counties in the state) in is more than 90% white, though recently theres been a small increase in the hispanic population, nothing much, just a family or 2</p>
