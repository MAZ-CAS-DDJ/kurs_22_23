<p>I feel the same way. The defining feature of my childhood was my brother, very unstable, large and very violent. I was in a position that I had to protect the little one for a long time, and later where I had to care for my father. I want to create a world where people take care of each other, and I want to fight against the things that stop that, the things that give these innocent little ones so much pain</p>
