<p>To be honest brother, I don't know what to say about the subject. This subject is so controversial, that people rather tend to debate whether we(Turks) are trying to forcibly include certain peoples like Finns into their special club, whereas ironically, the Europeans are the ones that are trying to do so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I on the other hand, stand for the right of the Finnic people to choose with whom they wish to associate with.</p>
<p>The Finnsh people have many relatives in Siberia, some of whom who still adhere to olden customs, some who are of a different denomination of Christianity, who have not yet been influenced by western European civilisation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for whether we Turks, Mongols and Tungus, have a kinship with the Ugro-Finnic(Uralic) peoples, I cannot say for certain, although there are certain linguistic similarities in terms of linguistic gender neutrality, sentence order, and more, and that that there are Turkic and Finnic people inhabiting the same geography(in the Idel-Ural area), I can say that it is a possibility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ultimately, it is up to the Finnish people to decide with which people they wish to associate with more. </p>
