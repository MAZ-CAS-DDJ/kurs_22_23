	That's just such a strange thing to think about. If you can talk to your sisters about it, I would. I've got three siblings, one of whom doesn't want kids (all their time and money is spent helping darkies), one's a radical feminist and the other is a miscegenator. I'm very jealous.

	Well I'm down for a community like that as soon as I get a woman and start on the kids, because I'll be damned if I'm raising my kids in a bloody city.

	I'd actually prefer Tasmania myself as well, for the climate if nothing else. I'm not a fan of the heat.

	That's a shame with the mothers group; my older sister said she liked hers a lot. Maybe yours was just dodgy?

	Well, the government is evil. It's trying on purposeÂ (or through stupidity) to wipe out Australians, there's no other word that I'd use for someone that wants that, or is so naive and incompetent that they let it happen. It's a good thing you don't trust them; any good they do is either by accident or simply helps them facilitate their goal of democide.
