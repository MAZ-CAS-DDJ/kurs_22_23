	I am in the Boston area, but I didn't think it was that funny. It was a stupid move, and it got this site shut down for several days. <br />

	PS. I know you're not my friend. I know you're the guy who thinks that doxing me is going to help the police. Thing is, I didn't put up any of those stupid stickers. I think the whole thing was stupid, and I'm not in the Atomwaffen Division.

	I understand your anger and frustration with the situation, and I think those posters were inappropriate as well. Things like that have no place on private school property. While we may disagree politically, we can both agree on that. And I know you're dead set on "turning me in" or whatever, but I can promise you I had nothing to do with it. <br /><br />
	I hope you understand what I've said here. I am truly sorry for what your school had to experience (especially so close to finals week), but I'm not the person you're looking for. The Atomwaffen Division is a sketchy organization that I would have no part of. I recommend you stay away from them, too.
