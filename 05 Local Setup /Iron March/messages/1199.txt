<p>So I am considering moving to South Africa for political reasons. It seems to me that there is a much larger presence of racially and politically aware men like me. On top of that, the AWB and Terre'Blanche have served as an inspiration to me. As someone who actually lives there, is this a good idea? Is the situation there worse than I surmised?</p>
