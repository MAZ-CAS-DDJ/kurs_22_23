	Hey Xav! Was just thinking of writing you yesterday but looks like you beat me to it :) So how have you been then? How is your new place? Yeah so thanks for watching the video, I know you read the book to and I just thought you would appreciate it. Though now that I think about it my main concern about the video is that it would get me gassed because of the sex scene. Thoughts on that? Anyway it is all probably a mote point anyways since my posts are usually just ignored anyways. But still let me know though if because of that scene you think that I would get gassed because of it . But again it is all probably a mote point anyways. And yes I too prefer the book.

	Yeah, the Paganism thread got out of hand pretty quickly and I had no desire to participate in IM Religious Wars episode 5,000. It actually looks like <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/2170-zeiger/&amp;do=hovercard" data-mentionid="2170" href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/2170-zeiger/" rel="">@Zeiger</a> moved all of that stuff to a different thread like it should have been in in the first place.

	Christianity though is a universalist religion and is therefore imo more likely to reject Nationalism period. Not that there are not exceptions. (Orthodox Nationalism) It is primarily for this reason that I reject Christianity in favor of Paganism because Paganism imo is less likely (unless you embrace a real faggot and universal type of Paganism, which unfortunately is what 98-99% of what so called Paganism is nowadays) to reject Nationalism. Also, with Christianity being a universal religion it is imo more susceptible to the corruption and decay of which we are seeing today. Though again I don't think this is Christianity's fault but rather the inevitable result of embracing a universalist philosophy and living in the Kali Yuga.

	As for how I have been doing, I am doing fine and I am getting ready to start a new semester this coming Tuesday.
