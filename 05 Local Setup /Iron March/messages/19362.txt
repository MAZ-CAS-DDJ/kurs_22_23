	My problem is going alot deeper, where do I get a clear and detailed conception of authority, because those authors you mentioned didn't really try to formulate it - rather there is descriptive historical research in many other aspects of traditionalism, but I can't find it. There is supposed to be many works on castes but I can't find that either. There has to be a new way of perceiving royalty, perhaps using ancient India, China and Arabia works. The hardest traditional principle of all - that has hampered right-wing theory seems to be left by the way side. Without that conception, words like 'organic' has only vague connotations.
