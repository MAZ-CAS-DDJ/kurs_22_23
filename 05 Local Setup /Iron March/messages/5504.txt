<p>Thank you for your words re the public perception.  I actually think the public perception hurdles are greater in the US than the UK and, probably, than anywhere else.  The Jewish aspect of it all is enormous and where we live, heck, it is Tel Aviv on the Delaware!</p>

<p>I have actually had a quiet word with a particularly close friend who happens to be a lawyer. He is fairly sympathetic to the fascist movement but would never put pen to paper or nor sit behind a keyboard and write anything on the subject nor a jot about politics, social issues...nor even his opinion on movies/books/tv or the state of the roads for he knows full well, nothing these days goes away, can be seen by "anyone" and may be held against the individual in a decade or so.  His opinion of me is that I am addled, not for my views but for starting to express them purely on the basis of the business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyway, I'll see what, if any, pertinent pointers Sam Westall can make.</p>
