	Nice. I actually don't wear hats a lot either. Just thought it might be a bit nice to have one and wear in winter. So what do you think should I go ahead and get one? PS Is yours also a reproduction of the exact German design for WW2 or has your been modernized? Like today's field caps? Black or Field Gray?
