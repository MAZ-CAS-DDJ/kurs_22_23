<p>BS is relatively right wing, but that's like moderate ring wing, of course it's a large group so opinions differ. They have some nationalistic and patriotic stuff, like the song about Kosovo and other stuff, but that's acceptable in Serbia, it's not too radical, Serbia is a country of nationalist sentiment. A lof of people from the scene listen to them because it's cool music that's associated with masculine gangster and hooligan subculture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This one is really cool, it's dedicated to Serbian water polo team and Serbian sportsmen in general. Serbia has achieved quite a lot in sports, as did Croatia for example, it's quite common for nations of Eastern Europe to have good sportsmen and sportswomen in all kinds of sports, it's the legacy of our specifical communist system I guess (quite ironic that those regimes placed so much importance in sports while today marxists complain about ableism).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I always loved this song, I used to listen to it before going to trainings, really powerfull song. You see, that's why a lot of nationalists like them, while they're not openly 'fascist' songs like this one are totally fascist in character. And of course, sport is extremely important for the scene here, more than half of the scene is involved in hooliganism and fan culture (ultras). I prefer music like this to a lot of bonehead stuff in RAC.</p>

<p>Quick translation:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Title: We are that team</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whole life I'm in training</p>
<p>to beat an obstacle</p>
<p>to forget about trouble in my soul</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I struggled</p>
<p>in the worst weather</p>
<p>walking on thorns</p>
<p>not on red carpet</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And even when life wasn't sparkling</p>
<p>it made sense</p>
<p>I never fealt guilty</p>
<p>becuase of hundreds of sacrifices</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Biting like a pitbull</p>
<p>when facing a crisis</p>
<p>I could lift 10 times</p>
<p>but I did it 150 times<br /><br />I never experienced defeat</p>
<p>some say that it's bitter</p>
<p>some say that struggle is only foreplay for downfall<br /><br />When it's hard they say enough</p>
<p>in fact that's a trap</p>
<p>but I have serum against it</p>
<p>it's named will</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sun which shines</p>
<p>as if saying "hold on"</p>
<p>wind music for my ears</p>
<p>rain rhytm which pours<br /><br />On Belgrade asphalt</p>
<p>these legends are made</p>
<p>blossoming until they're forged in the best</p>
<p> </p>
<p>through cracks in the concrete</p>
<p>In every neighbourhood of the city</p>
<p>they rose like stars</p>
<p>but they all remember where they come from</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chorus (2x):</p>
<p>Sun is shinning like gold</p>
<p>everyone attack with courage</p>
<p>remember that in Belgrade</p>
<p>today is the day for victory</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are that team</p>
<p>which understands each other in motion</p>
<p>following the codex</p>
<p>winning in one move</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are that team</p>
<p>with complete determination</p>
<p>agreement with one look</p>
<p>enough for decision<br /><br />When emotions carry us</p>
<p>and when worries crush us</p>
<p>that's the character of this team</p>
<p>everyone knows us for it</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everyone remembers the champions</p>
<p>champions of million</p>
<p>who leave their heart</p>
<p>until they burn out in victory</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because that is how we grew up</p>
<p>Spartan education</p>
<p>we didn't have a childhood</p>
<p>to become the best<br /><br />To become immortal</p>
<p>we became a team</p>
<p>we sacrificed ourselves</p>
<p>that is how we prepared</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let's raise our hands</p>
<p>because our nation is made for this</p>
<p>to support those</p>
<p>who shine for our colors<br /><br />Because we came here</p>
<p>to fullfil the dreams</p>
<p>to light up the sea</p>
<p>and raise everyone on their feet</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our thought, our idea</p>
<p>let it shine like a flare</p>
<p>everyone together with us</p>
<p>because there's no going back from here</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chorus again</p>
<p> </p>
