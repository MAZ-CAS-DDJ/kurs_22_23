<p>Hey Venator,</p>
<p>This is Blackshirt 13 again, I am writing to thank you for responding to my e-mail. You don't how excited I am to find another Fascist philosopher. It is a real shame but there just aren't that many of us. I posted in the anti-intellectualism thread that Fascism DOES NEED intellectuals and that it is my dream to be a Fascist philosopher/intellectual. Needless to say, some people bashed this and basically said that Fascist Intellectualism is impossible. I disagree we need to be able to battle the Marxists both physically and intellectually, let me know what you think. Anyways to answer your question the philosophers I look to are Nietzsche, Evola, Spengler, and other that the far-right typically draw inspiration from. Unfortunately, the university I attend does not do continental philosophy but analytical instead, so I don't get to hear about these guys too often. So, sorry if I rambled on, anyways please let me know if you get this.</p>

<p>PS I would love to do philosophical PM's back and forth. Also, mind if I add you to my page as a friend?   </p>
