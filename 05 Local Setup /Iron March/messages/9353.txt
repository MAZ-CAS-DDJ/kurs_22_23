<p>I'm reminded of Mussolini's quote; "War is to man what motherhood is to woman." I am not sure if the Church respects the warrior's calling anymore, but the Movement is the only righteous place of the warrior in the modern age. Our roles are eternal and holy, the act of creation and nurturing is inseparable from the act of destruction in the goal of preservation.</p>

<p>My sister also wants no children, she hates all her friends who have had offspring and can't live the party life anymore. I love her and her boyfriend is a very nice guy but they are the definition of hipster. What I do admire about them is how they live outside the world of careers and the rat race unlike their friends, they make good money walking dogs and doing freelance design. She is my only sibling so it is all up to me in keeping my bloodline alive, I'll take that task on gladly. As for my best friend, I am glad I have converted him to fascism; he wants a family of his own.</p>

<p>Tell me more about your siblings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I want to understand you, Emma. I want to meet you in the flesh and I want us to grow together. I know I am young and untested but I know when something is right.</p>

<p>My dreams were as sweet as you are but I do not remember them, I never remember the good dreams...</p>
