<p>Nasheeds? Sounds like an ironmarcher.</p>

<p>Well, I would say not to worry, there are lots of guys who'd be interested in a cute young lady with such good values as you, but people say the same shit to me (...Apart from calling me a cute lady, I mean) and it doesn't help because I don't give a fuck about these other people, <strong>there was somebody specific I wanted</strong>... So yeah, I won't bother saying that.</p>

<p>Yeah, I haven't talked about this to anybody before. It's not something I can bitch to my guy friends about, so thanks for listening. Well, funny story, I did talk to one person about it, there was this Polish girl who's been a bit obsessed with me since I was still with my ex. It's funny because she is the most EXTREMELY liberal person you could imagine. Patronizing while trying to be sweet- she was under the impression that she was going to convert me. She finally went crazy yesterday and gave up talking to me. It's a pity our whole chatlog is too long to post cause it was just... Very funny, but I'm digressing with weird stories again. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>How about hunting? Ever been hunting? Or do you just go full-hippie in the woods? I love camping and exploring outdoors but I usually do so with a rifle. Or at least when I had one, my father's, when I was younger and lived on his property. I'm on the terrorist watch list now and I won't be able to legally own a firearm in Australia.</p>

<p>Bit random, but I thought you might like a TV show of mine. It used to be "our" favourite show. I introduced it to her, too. I identify alot with the main character. Y'know, if you had time and were interested. I find it funny, anyway. Maybe you'll hate it, who knows! The whole series is on youtube. It's about this guy who owns a bookstore but hates people.</p>
