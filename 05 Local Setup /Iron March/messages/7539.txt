<p>I'll get torchat once I get my computer's shipped to me once I get a place, You should too. The charges won't restrict me much and I'm denouncing my citizenship. I'll stay involved in the biz I am in. I love you more than anyone else and you are my brother until the end, and once I get there I'll involve 24/7 of my day to National Action and setting up the "inner circle" of what we discussed. Emmy is a good contact for contact between us. I've been on the computer in the mental hospital I get discharged from today, but I'll be regularly checking on the library in Oakland and SF once I get out of jail after they release me today(failure to appear due to being in the hospital, jail will release me just gotta wait for court so just a few days). I understand that and I'll help you set up a secure network for not only just you, but all of NA so the info stays quite, and once I get there I'll start encrypting all the members stuff for you guys and such. You can help me easily by just being my brother, worse I would have to do is be homeless and avoid arrest and I learned I'm strong enough to even handle that.</p>
