<p>I never talked about translating the Worker or any of Junger's works, I had put effort into translating Ustryalov's works into English. You can, though, get Evola's analysis of Junger's the Worker in english, at least partially as far as I know, which is essentially just Evola reorganizing Junger's text with some explanations, because the Worker is written in a rather confusing manner, disassociated sometimes, albeit its more prudent to read the actual text first.</p>
