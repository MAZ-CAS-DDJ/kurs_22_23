	Yeah fair enough. If I can give advice with learning a language, if you've got 20 minutes free time every night use that to learn the language of your choice. Learning vocab on Memrise can be done easily in 20 minutes at the '15 words a day' option or whatever it is. Just spend 20 minutes learning grammar and vocab per day if you can and you'll learn a lot without having to put in a huge amount of effort.
