	I presume you are right about how difficult it is to find a secure place in order to live a healthy and natural family life; that's a question to a lot of members too who want to organize and build communities. What about the coastal region next to the Black or the Mediterranean Sea? One of the Turkish guys I worked with came from a place like that and he told me it was nice and tranquil. There have to be a lot of little villages in that zone.
