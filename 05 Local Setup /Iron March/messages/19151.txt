	Well, the issue is that a lot of ethnic Russian regions were handed over to other "Soviet Republics" by Stalin. As a result, post-Soviet borders are entirely artificial and don't reflect the actual ethnic or cultural composition of people in them, hence why there were so many ethnic conflicts in post-USSR and post-Yugoslavia.

	Ukraine should have done same thing Czechoslovakia did when it divided into two different countries, which was fair for each nation.

	Azov claimed to be National-Socialist, but they seem to be okay with Georgians and Chechens, while fighting against other white people. If they were actual National-Socialists, their goal would be to take power in Ukraine, not fighting wars for a government that consists of Jews lol
