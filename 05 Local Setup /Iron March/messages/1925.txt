<p>First of all, You are welcome to be in this forum!</p>
<p>Ave to you as well!</p>
<p>regarding my ideological journey, as in e.g. Libertarian to KimIlSungist, i will explain it as much as possible.</p>
<p>Short:</p>
<p>Communist - national socialist - conservatism - national socialism - right wing socialist + juche + songun (current ideology)</p>
<p>Sorry for being messy.</p>
<p>I was born in 1993, and i started my journey when i was 11, when my history teacher told me that the spanish treated us like shit. Then usa came, then japan, and usa+liberals+nation traitors (like cory aquino and conjaugncos) are fucking our country up. Plus mass media made idiocy. </p>
<p>My communism was all triggered not by "workers of the world unite" but by love of country (we were under spain, then usa, then japan and usa again, so i got enraged, i want militarism for the good of the people, and i wanted DPRK or Russia to free us, though i only want DPRK to help us now instead). Back then, i thought that communism was the way to keep my country from doom. Even if i abandoned communism, i did not thought of leaving my country behind. I found ways, but all of them did not do well with my country. I thought of taking Socialism, since it was the only way to redeem my country from liberalism and capitalism, amd that my country was oh so poor. So i did. I kept National Socialism, though i left it because i did not understand things at that time. </p>
<p>I thought of conservatism, but it was useless for the people, mainly because a lot of Filipinos have been suffering under it, though that does not mean i am for liberalism (Morals and tradition be kept, but not injustice in my ideal state)</p>
<p>Even if i was a leftist, i did not like many concepts of liberastism found in leftist states. I saw the so-called communist states (DPRK, USSR and PRC, i think they're national socialists, though not of the Hitler/Strasser forms), as countries that should be imitated. After leaving communism, i looked at Kahanist websites, though it was a retarded exploration, though i never thought of putting it in Filipino contexts. After that, i went into the pro-gun side of US politics, though i wasnt an american, but i wanted to put it in Filipino context. Then came Ironmarch, and the fact that our world, and my country (since 1565) has gone into shit (Torture-Device showed the way). I left exploring the US politics. Then came North Korea and her wonderful society, with their parades, devotion to the Kims, and total nationalism and socialism combined. (i hope you wont call me a communist, i am not.) this is why i have a Kim Jong Il avatar, because his father led Korea from liberalism, while he steered it from total extinction done by south Korea and the Liberal governments. I am not Korean, but i do want to copy the DPRK, because we Filipinos have the same tragedies Korea had (enslaved for a lot of years, humilation under foreigners, though we are lucky we aren't divided)</p>
<p>Now that i am in Ironmarch, i thought of myself as conservative with bits of left and righ wing thoughts, then onto Juche and Songun, nouvelle droite (the USSR would take care of the Philippines better than usa), and now right wing socialism, that is, morals/tradition must be kept, while the best of socialism (social justice and state socialism), shall be used to keep my country from the cesspool of liberastism.  </p>
<p>regarding my beliefs, </p>
<p>First of all, i am a socialist, but i'm not a liberal. I don't like anti-militarization (liberals here are against it). I also am against total democracy too. As Flipinos, we must preserve the best of our culture, while disregarding the bad parts of it (victimzation culture, weakness, total hospitality, abuse to women, total manliness/womanliness), and take the best of socialism (state socialism, social justice), the socialism used is DPRK and USSR socialism. </p>
<p>Remember that J. A. Primo De Rivera said</p>
<p>"Fascism was born to inspire a faith not of the Right (which at bottom aspires to conserve everything, even injustice) or of the Left (which at bottom aspires to destroy everything, even goodness)"</p>
<p>I got this from my letter to Traum Von Eisen :</p>
<p>"In short, we keep the good values of the right (love for country, elders, working hard) and and left (coopreation, mass mobilization, everyone working and so on). A true conservative will accept the social conservatism prevailing in a socialist country, a fake one will despise a socialist state with right wing characters (like the DPRK), mainly because its socialist."</p>
