<p>I havn't spoken to some of them in months. I have been working hard on the next attack, which I think i have to complete in a week. I have worked solidly for a year on this - 2 years really.  I am not sure if you are on facebook - 'Diggie Dee' who landed me the interview is still around. You will also find simon novus, Peter Harris, and Michael prendergast who are pictured on the site, which is now back up again.</p>

<p>I have very big plans for the coming months.</p>
