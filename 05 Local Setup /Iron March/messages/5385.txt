<p>I majored in economics and (English) history and their model has a hole the size of a torpedo strike below the water-line.  Frankly, no ideology has a perfect answer to the practice of economics in motion and, in my view, a problem with a Fascist State is the likelihood to try to merely print money - ironically, the very problem facing the US economy with the huge over-hang of debt which, under a weak democratic government is even more of a potential issue than under a fascist one.   I do fear that the debt issue facing the US - and other countries - will bite deeper into the cultural decay. The flipside, it does provide opportunities for us: Greece is the current, obvious example.</p>

<p>Complete agreement re National Action.  I do think that persons such as Noyles (?) need to be convinced of the NBU - a task for Gary or, perhaps, maybe someone further afield, such as yourself perhaps, to help him put the movement into realistic perspective.</p>

<p>On the matter of the NBU fb page, after I commented above to you about it, I see that the NBU web page put out a notice that NBU &amp; Blackshirt fb page in 12 hr limbo, supposedly due to pictures of the rally. Yet those pictures remain. I suspect it was the story of the Afghan girl which triggered someone to complain.</p>
