<p>Why do you keep pushing this? Are you trying to win me over to your point of view or something? Instead of trying to justify your love of Hitler to random people on the internet why don't you profess your affection for old Adolf to someone you know and respect and see how they react. Go and tell your mother, father, or grandparents (who are presumably from Britain) that you admire Adolf Hitler. Hopefully they'll put you on some kind of medication.</p>
