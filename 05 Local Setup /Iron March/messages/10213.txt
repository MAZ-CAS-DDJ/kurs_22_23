We are not of the same tribe, or the same race and if there was a race war I would fight for my family before him, but I would always consider him my friend. Blacks do have some positive traits if they are raised in a proper culture, not the degenerate shitfest that America is right now. </p>
<p>All races are different, doesnt mean they are inferior or superior. The only race I truly hate and think has no place on earth is the Jew, and that is merely my opinion, perhaps God does have some grand plan for them. Maybe in Imperium of man their noses will be used to sniff out heresy. </p>

<p>Yeah I agree, americas big mistake was taking down saddam. he wasnt perfect but he at least was keeping stability in that region. Yeah he invaded kuwait, who gives a fuck? thats their fight, we had no right to interfere. This american concept of interventionism is retarded and needs to go. the arabs need a dictator to keep them under control, its no coincidence that most of these problems started as soon as the ottoman empire started dissolving. </p>
