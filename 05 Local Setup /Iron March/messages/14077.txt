	Hey. Sorry ive haven't replied in a LONG time, but I was on edge because the doxxer that we recently had submitted my IP to the police and I got a little visit from them as a result. Everything is fine now, but I originally didn't respond because the doxxer asked me for my skype the same time you did, so I was paranoid as fuckÂ and couldn't trust anyone at that point. And yes, I do have a skype, Its JaredCasalinuovo. I should probably use something other than my name, which I plan on doing. For now, though, that's my skype until I change the name. Its good to be back in the swing of things, Heil Hitler.
