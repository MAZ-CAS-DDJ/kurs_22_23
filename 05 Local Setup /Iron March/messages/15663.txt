	You know I am 25 years old, so most of the stuff I will show you is quite old.

	I will give you some tasks, you will have 10 days to complete them (that's the Fascist tempo Marcos! :D).

	- <strong>Watch</strong> the movie <a href="http://gnula.nu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/abre_los_ojos_poster_espa%C3%B1ol.jpg" rel="external nofollow">"Abre los Ojos"</a> by Alejandro Amen√°bar. There is a remake of this movie, called "Vanilla Sky" made by Americans - so of course that sucks. Watch the original Spanish one.

<p>
	- <strong>Install and play</strong> the game <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/167271-thief-gold-windows-other.jpg" rel="external nofollow">"Thief Gold"</a> by Looking Glass Studios. I am sure you will be able to download the GoG (Good old Games) version, that's the easiest way to Install it. 10 days will not be enough to complete it unless you play all day, so take it easy, the first 2-3 levels will do it.

<p>
	- <strong>Read</strong> the book <a href="http://eliberltda.com/imagenes/8424159535.jpg" rel="external nofollow">"El Dador"</a> by Lois Lowry. Don't watch the movie, it's horrible.

	I will interrogate you like the Holy Inquisition on the 12th of September. By the way, where you get your profile picture? I have found a picture similar to this here on IronMarch, but I forgot who uses it. The other thing: Renacer Europeo features my flag next to the Spanish one! That's cool. :D
