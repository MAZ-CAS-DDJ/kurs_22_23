<p>really cool, in the gulf there is nothing close to ultras although Saudi teams have attendance of about 60 thousand sometimes, only ultras in middle east I know of are in north Africa.<img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/77835000/jpg/_77835934_fan.jpg" alt="_77835934_fan.jpg" /></p>

<p>this is al ahly in egypt, the gulf is mostly shit when it comes to crowds because low population numbers, I dont really support any foreign teams, sometimes temporarily I will support a team because of cool players like zlatan or a cool story like southhampton, they sold 9 players last year but are second in premiere league, top class. </p>
