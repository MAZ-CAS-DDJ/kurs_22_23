<p>I don't have Skype, but I can Download it and probably should; with all the plans I have that require collaboration it would make my life easier, and it's cheaper than making long-distance phone calls as well. I lent my microphone to a friend recently but I could have it back by tomorrow if you're interested anyway. Just let me know.</p>
