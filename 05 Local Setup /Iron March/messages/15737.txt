	I'm throwing this idea out to you because you might have Atomwaffen or other contacts in jewy areas like LA or NYC.  If someone went to the premiere showings and spread almond oil (cyanide smell) and blue candy (something like nerds or rock candy), and possibly counter-propaganda on cars (with concern for fingerprint, printer forensics), it could really turn into a salt mine.  <br /><br /><br /><br />
