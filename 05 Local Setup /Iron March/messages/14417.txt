	I agree. I consider myself pretty intelligent, a guy who I feel smarter than isn't generally attractive to me and I need to be able to converse on the things that interest me. Whether it's music, art, or politics. On the other hand, physical strength is also attractive, I'm just instinctively attracted to musculature and not dweeby rail-thin guys. A guy who feels almost as effeminate as me is also kind of gross.

	So, I think that's definitely a great ideal to work towards. Having that physical-mental balance should help the movement with its efforts, it also should help its members socially by discouraging passivity or shallowness. And reproductively, women find it attractive.
