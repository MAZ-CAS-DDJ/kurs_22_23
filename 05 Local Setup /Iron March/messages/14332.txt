	Thats fucked up. I'm sorry you had to deal with all that shit. My father had a bit of a violent streak in him too, although it was mostly directed at me, it never escalated attempted murder. Do you talk to your mother still? How old are you? I'm only 25 but how everything happened at once made me grow up  really fast mentally. I come from a catholic family and I'm quite religious myself but my father wasn't at all. It made things real screwy within the family during all this and with me trying to get my head around heaven and hell
