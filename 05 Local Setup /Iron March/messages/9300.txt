<p>btw, do you have any good pdfs on Traditional Catholicism?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I went to Catholic church with my family when I was younger but only for special occasions, then I got into heathen stuff. Kind of my autistic stage of rejecting anything I associated remotely with egalitarianism... or parents. I still love the runes and stuff though.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But I want to understand more about my real (or more recent) heritage.</p>
