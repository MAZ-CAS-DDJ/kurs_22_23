<p>I cannot even remember how many times I was reprimanded or even suspended for making guns with sticks, guns with paper, even guns with my hand. And the fags think they have it so bad, that being normal makes you privileged. All I remember was the emasculated boys being favored in everything. I have a lot of anger from the earlier part of my life. Even today the assault on my identity continues, my mother thinks I'm "misogynistic" for preferring gender roles - fuck that, I'm more respectful to my girlfriends and women in general than her shitty liberal boyfriends ever could be. She uses the most dishonest and manipulative techniques to dissuade me from my natural inclination. /rant over, sorry.</p>
<p>That's terrible Emma, I feel so bad for you, especially that you did not know then why it made you upset. Even before I realized my fascism I could never have dated other races, they never were attractive to me. All those other girls in that terrible position, between their natural inclination and the degeneracy society pushes on them, need help desperately but I don't know how it can be done.</p>
<p>I can credit my school with two things; firstly it showed me the reality of race without a media filter, and secondly it developed my awareness of my existence as an other, as a white and son of europe, even while I made friends with some blacks.</p>
<p>It's so sad when animals die. My husky died last summer and it added insult to all the injury I was experiencing at the same time. I still have a cat, he's a gigantic fellow, an indeterminate mix of persian and something else.</p>
<p>Live with kebabs? I would rather die. Thankfully the organization is fairly accomodating to one's preferences if they are worded right.</p>
<p>Btw, are you alone in Seattle as a fascist or are there any others you know? </p>
