<p>2 documents need to be created and added to the website: </p>
<p>1. Fitness manual - This should be up to date and be clear and concise. It should focus on getting fit, staying fit and body maintenance opposed to how to fight. </p>
<p>Things to include would be beginners running, 5x5 starting strength, foam rolling and specific tasks a person should be able to complete. These can be taken from military manuals. A lot of this can be compiled using some already made info graphics. </p>
<p>This would allow a one stop manual for the movement to refer to and follow to become fighting fit instead of trawling through loads of shitty books, pdfs, forums to find basic information and instruction. </p>
<p>2. Activism - A manual giving direction, ideas and inspiration to activists on what they can do as an individual or as a group. </p>
<p>Demos and un-co-ordinated stickering is the activism currently offered to activists. Demos are not frequent. Direction should be given to people on what to do, what works, what doesn't. Something to give purpose to groups in regions. This will keep people involved during down time and allow them to grow larger. </p>
