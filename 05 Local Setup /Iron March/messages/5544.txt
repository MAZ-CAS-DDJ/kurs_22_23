<p>It's matter of semantics and the ratio between the use of the internet and street activism depends really in the situation. For the municipal elections we had a lot of populace getting the message in a narrow space. There street activism did wonders. For national appeal and international, the internet was crucial since interest was rising and so did the visits on the main page.</p>

<p>But honestly, in my experience facebook and other social media are really a double-edged knife. Even if you know how to use it, it can still fuck you up really badly. Social media work for apolitical autist gatherings like Occupy Wall street and shit. For a political activist it's a no go area if he wont's to get the job done.</p>
