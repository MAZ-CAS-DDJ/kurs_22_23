<p>Sounds interesting, I'll give this stuff a read over. I'm not too clued up on the Aussie movements other than the national anarchist ones which were around for a while and are a joke wherever they are tried.</p>

Interesting to hear that about the unions and labour party, although I'm not overly surprised; the socialists used to be pretty realistic on race, take Jack London for example. Even Engels and Mikhail Bakunin were very racist and somewhat nationalistic. Personally I'm not a fan for economic socialism and I see <strong>social</strong>ism in the way that Rockwell, Hitler and William Pierce did (I can elaborate if you wish me to); although complete unchecked free trade is also a pipe dream and undermines national resources and work. As said earlier the economic policies of Pierce, Hitler and Rockwell are the ones I support; I also agree with Mosley's position that we should trade with those who buy from us.</p>
