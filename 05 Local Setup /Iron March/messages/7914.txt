<p>How did it come that you were introduced to Turanism? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for Turanism in Finland, yes, I can understand why. Finland has been under Swedish control for so long, and even now, the Swedes exercise control through linguistic dominance, forcing Finns to learn a non-standard form of Swedish that will not benefit them at all.</p>
<p>And given that Turkic and Finnic people have had a shared history in places such as the İdel-Ural area, I can positively state that Turan does hold a place for the Finnic people at heart, more so than what they can find in the EU, or amongst Russians.</p>
<p>But of course, it is up to the Finnish people to decide with whom they wish to associate with or not at all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of the Finns here are very opposed to the very idea, while some have a mild sympathy towards it, as you can see from this thread:<br /><br /><a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/2989-turkism-and-turanism/" rel="">http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/topic/2989-turkism-and-turanism/</a></p>
