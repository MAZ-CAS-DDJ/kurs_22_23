<p>I don't know if its available in English but an important reference piont for revolutionary-syndicalism is "The theory of Syndicalism" by Clara Meijer-Wichmann.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also the book "The birth of Fascist ideology" by Zeev Sternhell gives a clear insight in the development of fascist ideology and it contains several chapters about the (national-)syndicalist movement.    </p>
