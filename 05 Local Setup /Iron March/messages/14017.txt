	Love, sex, and she is the fairest of all the maidens. Freya was represented in ancient times as the may queen every year. The may queen was chosen to be the most beautiful and best woman in the tribe. That's essentially what she is. The best and most beautiful woman. She was also a war goddess.

	When people say that ancient gods / goddesses represented fertility, they are usually wrong. It makes no sense. Fertility was never an issue in the ancient world, as people did not wait until their women were 40+ to try and have kids... fucking idiots. The more you look into it the more bullshit it is too, when they find something (archeologists / historians) that they don't understand, they just say "oh it was fertility!" like that frog swastika found somewhat recently, they claimed it represented fertility since frogs are fertile! Complete fucking nonsense.

	I usually don't pray for specifics, more general things like good luck and guidance to be worthy and noble etc.
