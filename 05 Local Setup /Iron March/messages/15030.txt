	Hey Bear. How would one go about to send a letter to Bishop Williamson? I've tried to search the internet but can't find anything. No e-mail, no postal box, no adress. Nothing. Which is understandable considering the shirtstorms he have caused and all. Maybe you know where I could send it to be forwarded at least?
