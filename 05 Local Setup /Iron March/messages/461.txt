This country is bound to break up if any of the races which came here are to survive. The fact is that at this point we cannot deport all of the non-European types out of here, so I think we need to give them different parts of the country for themselves. It’s the only solution really, even if we could deport everyone we wanted to, we would lose a lot of the population and it might cripple the economy if done too quickly. I once theorized that it could be done successfully if we did it slowly and gradually enough, but I think that it is best to break up the U.S. at this point into different racial homelands.</div></blockquote>
<p>I agree with this. I think the United States should be broken up and different racial groups given their own homogeneous homelands possibly subject to European hegemony possibly given full control over their own states. The one guy in here said that America is the new Rome like it is a good thing, as racialists that should be a bad thing for us. Rome was degenerate and multi-racial not to mention overly-imperialist especially towards their own Indo-European brothers.</p>

<p>True, though Else Christensen did raise some objections to the Hitler regime like Strasser and I think that is what got her and her husband in trouble. It is my opinion that Hitler surrounded himself around too many esoterics such as Himmler and the order of Thule. He wasn't even very fond of Asatru/Germanic heathenry.</p>

But I hate this forum because most of the audience is not even open to the views I want to present. I would like to be on a site on which I know I am speaking to people who will actually take me seriously and think about what I have to say. On this site, I swear it’s as if everybody is either a soldier or a gangster (i.e. a grunt who just wants everyone to just march in line). This place is also sort of like VNN, it’s a vulgar, online version of a male locker room full of “tough guys” who like to beat each other up.</div></blockquote>
<p>I didn't know e-mail was easier for you, we could revert back to that if you like. Just shoot me an e-mail in reply if you wish. I would have to say that even Stormfront or eNat could be considered better than this site because at least those sites have a lot of ignorant people that simply don't know much and can be taught. It seems as if everyone here or on SP is either an intellectual reactionary or internationalist.</p>

I think that was exactly what I was trying to teach you back on Socialist Phalanx when you rejected race for a minute there.</div></blockquote>
<p>It is easy to get disillusioned when considering the cosmopolitan makeup of our nations today. Tribalism, which is what I adhere to, or being a crazy reactionary and simply believing in a nation because it happens to be there are really the only answers to globalism. I am not even sure I like the word Nationalist, as it implies separating Europeans on stupid grounds such as different anthems, flags, and lines in the ground when we are really all part of one big family and should unite. I would like to see a United States of Europe one day as Strasser advocated for.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="180" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>What do you like about Julius Evola? There are only a few things I like about Evola, but I kind of hate his overall philosophy. In essence, he argues that we should all live in stratified, patriarchal caste societies which he justifies using some occult bullshit ideas. He also denounces a lot of spiritual beliefs I have as being “lunar.” Most of what he calls lunar spirituality is good stuff (although that’s not to say that what he calls solar is bad).<p>To elaborate, Evola’s teachings obviously have some positive aspects from a conservative racialist-nationalist perspective, especially in his criticisms of the enemies. You’re already aware that his teachings on race had some influence on my thinking (although I might say that he is simultaneously somewhat misleading when it comes to race as well). However, I find his doctrine as a whole unacceptable, especially his idea of Tradition. What he calls “Tradition” is actually a mixture of practices and beliefs which are not always actually part of what I consider to be proper traditional Aryan practices, even though a few of them are. Evola takes things too far; the ancient European way of life did include a hierarchical society ruled by a monarch, but this elite was Folkish (i.e. to love the people as a whole) and socialistic, even though it practiced a simplistic tribal form of socialism. It was not some rigid caste system with an aristocracy obsessing over strange spiritual ideas which no one really believed (An example of what I’m thinking of is Evola’s idea that we need to be “initiated” to become immortal and the whole “solar”/“lunar” distinction, which is something I believe he is really wrong about).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I, too, actually share your criticisms. I think he is too obsessed with eastern occultism and caste systems; though I like his criticisms of modern society and I consider myself a traditionalist to a degree. Throughout my readings of Strasser and Evola I have found some common connections between their ideologies and found some inspiration in that. Both want to return to a more traditional European society and Strasser based his socialism on a traditional European guild system where hierarchy is completely necessary and left in tact. He, unlike Evola, propounds the need to root out injustices of such a system and actually gives us idea how we could develop such a system out of the ruins of degenerate capitalism.</p>

Now you list him as a major inspiration.<p>Did you happen to read the essays I sent to you yet? Any comments or questions?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Upon returning to a more folkish based Nationalism I re-read some parts of "For My Legionaries". I found some inspiration in it, such as what Codreanu was trying to do with the National Christian Socialist movement much like what Strasser was trying to do - trying to provide oppressed workers with an alternative to Bolshevism. However, I believe nowadays it is necessary considering the depths of depravity the liberal capitalist system has plunged our nations into to support activities such as strikes as Strasser did and harness that revolutionary potential into something nationalistic. For example, like when Codreanu went around and removed the communist flags from the factories and replaced them with Romanian ones - I have no desire to go around ripping down commie flags and replacing them with American ones. Perhaps with a new banner for our people, but I could care less about the American flag to be honest.</p>
<p>I did manage to read your essays, by the way. I enjoyed them especially the biography as it recapped a lot of what I read and what I actually forgot from "For my Legionaries". I do have one question, I have always had a curiosity about the man Constantin Pancu. I thought the whole fighting circle thing and him coming out on top was grand. Do you have more information on him?</p>

In the past I didn’t have the lyrics and I couldn’t translate the songs because I couldn’t quite hear what they were saying exactly. But now I am able to see what the songs say and I can give you the lyrics in English when I have some spare time to translate.</div></blockquote>
<p>Great to hear, I will gladly see the english lyrics when you have time. On a side note, have you heard this song? It has a nice tune and is pretty inspiring.</p>

<p>Note that Oliver is a bit crazy, so don't take all of his anti-Semitic remarks seriously as he sometimes manipulates facts when it comes to the Jews. But I think he is right when it comes to the Khazar theory.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I haven't really studied the Khazar theory much; though I do know a little less than half of Israel's population is Ashkenazic. Regardless, in reference to the thread I really don't think the Jews have a claim to Palestine considering the thousands of families that were there when they moved in - and appeals that that is their holy land really mean nothing to me.</p>
