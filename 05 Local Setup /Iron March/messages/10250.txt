<p>I never recommend arguing about sources or studies or any of that stuff. Our worldview is grounded in common sense. If you can't explain in simple terms, with obvious examples, what we think about a subject, then there's a problem.</p>

<p>Read my book, the chapter on homosexuality in particular. Your question is answered:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>
<p> </p>
<p>Argument: Homosexuals are just like hetero's, apart from their choice of sexual partners.</p>
<p>Rebuttal: No, you're wrong. Homosexuals live lives of hedonism totally unlike normal people. You could search your whole life and never find a homosexual who doesn't have a venereal disease, or who only had one partner in his entire life. It seems like your only contact with this is from soap operas.</p>

<p>Argument: A lot of gays have stable monogamous relationships.</p>
<p>Rebuttal: Yes, they do, on television soap operas and Hollywood movies. In real life - not so much.</p>
<p>Reply: I know many gay couples who have been together for a long time.</p>
<p>Rebuttal: Yeah, they appear to be stable, but they don't tell you about their weekly visit to the sauna together, their sex tourism in Thailand and the orgy their friend organized last month. A “stable gay couple" has nothing to do with a stable normal couple.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Argument: It's better for children to have gay parents than no parents at all, or to live in poverty. At least they have a home.</p>
<p>Rebuttal: Look, I really don't care about compromises and fringe cases - all I care about is what is the best, the ideal way to live our lives. The best, the ideal way for children to be raised by a loving man and woman, ideally with several siblings. We, as a society, need to do everything we can to promote this ideal and stamp out the harmful situations which arise when we stray from that ideal. I'm not going to give my blessing to something harmful and dangerous because “it could be worse".</p>

<p>Just as capable at raising children? That's obviously not true. They may be just as capable at raising kids to be neurotic, materialistic and hedonistic freaks as other people, and since that's what is "normal" in our society today, you could say the homo's are doing a good job. But fascists have a very different criteria when it comes to education: we want strong children with healthy instincts, who seek more in life than buying shiny gadgets on their credit cards and getting laid every chance they get. The "studies" certainly didn't have that criteria in mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The basic fact of life is that parenting is largely a matter of imitation, or teaching by example. Children will imitate their parent's attitude, behavior and outlook on life. Homosexuals are for the most part defective people. Their children's "test scores" in kindergarten are irrelevant. They're bad influences, whether they teach their "kids" stupid shit or not.</p>
