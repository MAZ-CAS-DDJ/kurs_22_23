<p>I can't become fluent in a language within the end of a year , my time is running out and I've sat here in a paralysis of the worst kind of the mind and of the spirit , I feel as if I am drifting towards the monotonous death of life in the modern world. sorry I'm listening to this when I wrote that </p>

<p>lol but yeah that's how I feel , I just hope my parents will take some small amount of mercy on me as I go nowhere but I fear that they won't and like a bird I will be thrown from the safety of the tree branches tumbling down to meet my fate.</p>
