<p>I use syndicate as a purely functional term, like corporation: they're effectively the same thing. It's an organization of workers that is meritocratic and collectivist, which means it includes cooperation of course, but cooperation sounds too leftist, it's not purely cooperation too, nor is it the primary principle. If the poor, unqualified workers get it the way or aren't productive I wouldn't hesitate to punish them. Generally, I simply prefer the term syndicates because words too have aesthetic. "Cooperative" implies some sort of utopian commune, "syndicate" implies a forge of workers. Just the sound, really.</p>

<p>It's a purely functional deal. I want to extremely downsize the modern service sector and create industrial jobs for all the public works projects in my immediate plans. Agriclture has proven to be a form of labor where its best left decentralized. Industry has shown otherwise, so I take whatever works.</p>

<p>These fields would likely mean 10-15 years. I'm not quite sure, but these are purely technicalities. Also, the military teaches a lot of the fundamental lessons necessary in the political leader, which would be discipline, commitment, loyalty, virtue, strength etc. In the best case, the military would be a much higher mantle than it is today, there would be tougher standards and higher requirements, therefore, the five years would be harder than they seem now, especially since this means five years without fail- no criminal records, no breech of regulations, no nothing. This all isn't so much pure brawn as it is indoctrination the same way that the goal of military service itself isn't so much about building strength as it is strength of character. The nation must be lead with martial virtue, and that should be the goal of the five year's service.</p>

<p>It isn't a political qualification, it's a qualification of national service. What you do to qualify is serve the nation, and what you receive is many things, responsibilities as well as obligations. You don't qualify by satisfying the political establishment, rather, by serving your nation. Also, I forgot to mention that there are many other qualifications purely for officership, but that wasn't entirely relevant to the question at hand. All officers should have served as rank-one's for a few years, depending on which military administration they're in (army, navy, air force) furthermore they need to go through several years of special schooling, once again depending on which administration. To add to this, there is the citizenship, but one of the specifications for service works side-by-side with this I believe.</p>

<p>Depends on the risk level at the time. In a period of some civil disobedience or war any anti-state statement can be considered a threat, and therefore acted against by righteous authority. In regular peacetime, I can accept criticism of state policy, but outright mockery of nation, tradition or values will not be tolerated. All political parties can be considered illegal. I'm not of course advocating a one-party state, but a state that works purely on ability and not on any bias by political ideology.</p>
