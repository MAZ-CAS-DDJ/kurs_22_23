<p>What's it like?  Is it worth relocating there?</p>
<p>I've been to Oregon and know that it's pretty, but I've never been to Washington.  My understanding is that it's similar to Oregon in climate and landscape.  Wyoming and Montana are nothing special to look at, but they're heard and shoulders above California when it comes to politics.</p>
