	I'd say no for the flags. The joint is in Chinatown, plus it's a bit early for all that. We need to make our positions on what to do clear, rather than do something half cocked and regret it later. Plus, I've got two flags back in Perth and I'd feel left out if I couldn't bring them. Next year, maybe?
