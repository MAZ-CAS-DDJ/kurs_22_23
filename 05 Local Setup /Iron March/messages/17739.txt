	Yes. Before all of that there are a few hurdles to cross, firstly there is a need for a base to work off of. The mind makes the man. Without logic and reason we cannot find truth and these things are not built into people, it is learned.

	Next there is a need to know what guidelines we are to live by, what it is to be a man and to find something worth fighting for and more importantly, worth dying for. Various Fascist sources can be found along with grains of truth elsewhere. A spiritual base is needed too which may be gotten from religion. I've had the fortune of having a fairly good upbringing in that regard. Then discovering the esoteric is necessary to bring principles with which to make proactive decision making. I'd say being in tune with the natural order of the universe can be learned first from stoicism (Meditations &amp; letters of a Stoic). For those of the greater leadership, the art of oration is needed here if the person in question is of suitable ability and character.

	Once someone has the will to act then there needs to be tactics, strategy &amp; methods of putting belief into action which is where I'm upto (having finished the IM originals, Imperium and Mein Kampf). A 25 point political social program for ordering a Germanic society is fine and dandy for the past "official" ways of bringing about a organic state, but there has to be a source of counter-revolutionary methods. I'm aware of SIEGE which I've yet to go through. Looking at history is one way. Theres plenty of anarchist books on this subject and one well known marxist doctrine, but fascism needed it the most. Beyond SIEGE I'm at a loss of where to look next.
