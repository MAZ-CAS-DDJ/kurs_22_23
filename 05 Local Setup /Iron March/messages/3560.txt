<p>I heard the singer of Orlik went on to become an actor in popular plays in Hungary and has always been criticized for his skinhead past.</p>
<p>I can understand why a lot of folks do not like skinheads because it seems over in your neck of the woods we are getting close to just the pure soccer hooliganism/asshole behavior of skins. It is totally understandable.</p>
<p>I actually come from the skin background -- in  many societies this is the only subculture that offers any amount of conservative/nationalist values.</p>
