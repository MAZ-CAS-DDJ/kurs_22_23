I've always been interested in Icelandic, and about a year ago a got a bit serious about it and studied it before finals popped-up and I had to turn my attention elsewhere. I was going to say "I recently tried to resume these studies, but the University of Iceland ended their free online classes." However, I checked the site to make sure this is true, and it is not! I have committed to studying Afrikaans with some friends, but I may just have to squeeze some Icelandic into my time! Certainly I have gone on for too long about this. Let's get to the message.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>You seem to be very interested in languages, if you are good into, it is a very good thing, we always need people wih some practical knowledge.</p>

<p>I was a true anarchist in the time, to squatting and to drink bear all the day <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>It was my first experimentsin activism in a ideological sense. I still have a lot of anarchist friends since that time.</p>
<p>The National-Anarchists are close to my ideas.</p>
<p>But I can not believe in the principle of anarchy, the state seems necessary.</p>
<p>The experiments of anarchism all failed.</p>
<p>Anarchy may degenerate into anomie, in individual leadership, in open market, and there is no defense against foreign powers, I think we can not organize utopian national things like energy, transport, studies,. ..</p>
<p>We need a minimum of planning, coordination and guidance at least for the economy.</p>
<p>And individualism is a scourge of society, like the extreme opposite of being an ant in a state-weight, I prefer organic and intermediate vision.</p>
<p>Anarchists know that in the most realistic vision in terms of living standards, it will be like the 19th.</p>
<p>It may be quite a cyberpunk with anomic lifestyle and current demography.</p>
<p>And how do against Immigration and Insecurity?</p>
<p> I'm wary of totalitarianism but I think it must be a powerful state above the federal structure for the military and foreign relations.</p>
<p>Hitler said that no one is better than a bad state, I agree.</p>
<p>I see the state as a tool, which must have an internal structure for organic does not degenerate into totalitarianism, I think, for example, against the powers, delegate everything that can be at the front: labor front, front housing, spiritual front, front policeman, who would be autonomous, and also to a control system of management and referendum of the citizens, as in Switzerland.</p>

<p>I think it would be the logic issue, because they simply work for themselves, and there would not be still some financial wealth, only concrete things like location, energy or food, i think that others state levels (when i say "the state" it would be different levels under the same word)  the need some taxes to subsist, for example a portion of transactions that the state has helped establish between communities. or the state will need to charge for services as a private company.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="202" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>is the casteless state of traders a result of a desire for economic autarky, veiled anti-Semitism, or something else altogether?</div></blockquote>
<p>Jews didn't exist at this time, it was millenias after that they emerge from their desert.</p>
<p>It was because traders are only raptors, they make profits in being intermediates : for example they buy food from the town A to sell it on the town B, and that's all.</p>
<p>I distinguish the pure traders as intermediaries with artisans who bring something (baker, bartender, butcher, artist, farmer, cook)</p>
<p>For the indo-european mentality, trades are not wise (physician, poet, priest, philosopher), combatant (warrior or kings), artisan / producer.</p>
<p>I noticed that the merchants breed them most of the time and form a caste inbreeding, they are genetically inferior, they spread a nomadic mentalitty because it is their livelihood</p>
<p>80% of traders are liberal according to statistics, more than twice that in the rest of the population</p>
<p>they would sell their mothers for profit.</p>
<p>After there is some different declinations of the tripartitions, it degenerate into a cast system in India, because it was a system based on race.</p>
<p>In celtic countries, it was more a class system, and more flexible in germanic or hellenic civilisation. But it depend, for example Sparta established a strict cast system with this.</p>
<p>I am not to divide people into roles.</p>
<p>It is rather a question of mentality, of rhetoric, lifestyle. We must focus on these three "values​​": everything intelectuel, warrior and materially productive, against the current money system.</p>
<p>We all must be an intelectual, a warrior and a producer, a "free citizen".</p>

<p>Welsh it is around 15% of people, so three twice more, and in the irish-gaelic, it is quasi extinct now, perhaps 1%.</p>
<p>whereas they are independent and that it is an official language.</p>
<p>It is globalization that fuck them.</p>

<p>It went well. I do not expect a guy in animal skin obviously, but a long-haired hippie with delusions, but no.</p>
<p>He was a director of Scientific Research (Centre national study does) so someone more "normal".</p>
<p>Quite interesting, quite to the left too, but rather an anarchist so no problem</p>
<p>We talked a little theology (ragnarok, freyja, the perception of the gods), about druidism, and about mutual friends, and have planned to perhaps organize 2-3 more meetings in the coming months: ceremonies, camping, ...</p>
<p>We also both laughed well.</p>
<p>See you soon.</p>
