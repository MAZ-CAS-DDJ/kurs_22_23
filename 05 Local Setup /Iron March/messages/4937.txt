<p>Can you just not connect at all or do you get an error like "ERROR: Connection Dropped IMAP" or something similar (and if this is the case do you use roundcube)? There were a good number of exit nodes "lost" this week which is more than likely the culprit. A lot of onions are down right now. To answer your question about it's hosting, from what I can discern from some quick enumeration, Tormail is hosted in America as the nameservers are located in Portland Maine.Â </p>
