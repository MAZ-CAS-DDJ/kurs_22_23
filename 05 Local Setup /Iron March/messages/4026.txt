<p>I completely understand about the "fasimz", but I can't abandon it.</p>
<p>I was never involved in a church.  I was in the process of finding my faith so I was looking into multiple churches.  All of that is behind me now as I'm joining a Western Rite Orthodox Church which is ran by the Antiochians, I've been corresponding with them for awhile.  It's essentially Anglo-American Orthodoxy.  They use the Divine Liturgy of St. Tikhon rather than the Byzantine.  There are only 20 Western Orthodox chruches in North America and I just happen to be right next to one of them.</p>
