<p>Trust me, I have been frantically contacting... Her phone is obviously confiscated and dead, the jail won't let me speak to her... She has to call me herself and I have to pick it up, then pay money to talk. She called last night and I couldn't get to my card in time, then this morning I was in the subway with no reception. You can't call back, it's a routing number. It's totally fucked up.</p>
<p>So all I have is what she told me about the vandalism and hearing her get arrested as we were on the phone.</p>
<p>I have been to that one, so beautiful. I have been to some in Europe too. What majesty.</p>
<p>I don't think martyr shootings are what we need right now. It's much more important to gather supplies and friends for the long haul. I'm going to be on the internet and IM a lot less these coming weeks, because it is just too easy to reveal yourself accidentally.</p>
