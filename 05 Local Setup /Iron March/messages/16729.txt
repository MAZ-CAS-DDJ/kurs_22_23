	With all the news stuff going on I'm getting a little uncomfortable with Ironmarch , although before that I started to feel a little disillusioned with the whole thing. I tried to remember how I thought pre-Ironmarch. It was different it wasn't like I was complacent with degeneracy in anyway I hated minorities and fags , I wasn't sure if there was a god or not I kind of liked the ideas scientists came up with. I didn't have all of these we have to destroy the world now sort of apocalyptic views.

	I mean when I look at Slavros analytically its clear that he lacks power in his real life so he seeks it online, Go read his Introduction at the start of the Introduction thread. He says he has political aspirations, what could those possibly be ? The Slavros I know detests the modern system and political parties. Slavros is nothing more than a man seeking to satisfy his ego through a wacky end times philosophy , albeit that has truth to it, although after reading Evola I began to question Slavros's interpretations of Evola's writings , it seemed like he was adding things reading between the lines of things that weren't there. Placing his own strange ideas mixed with the en capturing rhetoric of Evola. 
</p>

<p>
	For instance Evola decided that a man to reach transcendence should abstain from sex entirely , we can't have a fascist society without procreation. 
</p>

<p>
	Evola never called himself a true fascist always a traditionalist , he spoke of the hierarchy of a divine monarchy. 
</p>

<p>
	Evola also saw that the rebirth would come in cosmic terms not through human intervention and that death and rebirth were the only way to accept the cosmic order. He practically wrote the only way out of this is through transcendence. leaving the endless cycle
</p>

<p>
	Anyways regardless of the Evola criticisms , 
</p>

<p>
	I just am starting to feel like this is more of a confused cult with order but no real direction but chaos, honestly I don't know I'm thinking about taking a break from Ironmarch for awhile at least on my semester off I need some time to go back to my own mind and just think without trying to fit it into this worldview. So I'm probably not coming around for a few months probably starting in December.
