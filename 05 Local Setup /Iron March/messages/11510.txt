<p>Blackshirt, I need to tell you everybody was just kidding around trying to troll you on the libdegen thread. Black lipstick/ hair dye is actually a traditional feminine fascist symbol. As you should know Hitler set up in 1934 the Der MÃ¤dchenGothGruppe. This state organisation's purpose was to guide young women in the aesthetic of the coming thousand year Reich. They pioneered many styles that have been co-opted by these modern liberal girls today (like how the hitler youth haircut is in style for men now). You see it was a tradition for one of the old Germanic tribes called the schwarzeschuhes to dye the hair of their women with vegetable dyes. Haven't you heard of this aspect of the NSDAP? I can show you some historical pictures.<br /><br />Hitler and Mussolini would have thought she was cute (apart from being a liberal), don't you like her at all?</p>
