<p>The problem with being historian today is that dominant concepts in historiography are Marxist crap and everything else has become a bit outdated because marxists were deliberately put on important positions after 1945 and their work was massively overrated. I posted something about that Jew rat Hobsbawm, most overrated historian of all times, I honestly couldn't even read his work, he's so boring. Is not because he's Jewish, Tony Judt is a Jew and his work about history of post-war Europe is one the most readable history books, it's simply that he's a boring marxist commie. He was extremely ugly too. So if you want to write anything good you'd have to reinvent hundreds of concepts and it would take decades to do it. In university they were preaching us for 3 years about how nations were invention of 19th century and some crap about "identities". Everyone just took it for granted. Partly this is correct, but marxists take it to extremes. Even if there was no German nation in the modern sense in 17th century, there is a clear continuity between those German-speaking people and German-speaking people in 19th century (ie. their identity has evolved), marxists who think that nations were some sort of "deus ex machina" that were created out of nowhere are simply retarded. It's hard to counter it though because the previous concepts are a bit archaic and inspired by romantic nationalism too much. Without this marxist bullshit we would have much better understanding of nations and their evolution in Europe, their concepts make a good research simply impossible.</p>

<p>Hopefully one day I could write a history of Fascism with completely new conceptual framework. Something like what Nolte did, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism_In_Its_Epoch" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism_In_Its_Epoch</a> It was pretty revolutionary when published, but obviously that's just a dream at the moment. A history of Central Europe focusing on modernity would be a good project too. It's a shame that Taylor's work Habsburg Monarchy is still considered as the most important book, he had a very clear anti-German bias and out of all languages of the monarchy could only speak German, which is why he was extremely ignorant about some events in Croat history for example, because he simply couldn't check enough relevant sources. </p>

<p>When I have time, I'll open a thread about Hitler, supposed anti-Slavism and relations between Slavs and Germans in Central Europe.</p>

<p>That Slavic Union article was good, I remember it. The pro-Stalin crap was extremely embarrassing, I read some of the debates. As I said in some few of my posts, Orthodox nations have this way of legitimizing everyone in power just because he represents some quasi-mysticism of powerfull state and leadership. For me, it's simply cowardly to support Stalin just because he had a strong state and army and because he won the war. That's for cowards who always side with those who appear stronger at the moment and don't care about the truth or ideals. To me, Russia doesn't have any potential for fascist revolution anyway, Russia will always be a pragmatic empire and every ideology eventually turns into a mere background of some authoritarian nationalistic regime, because that's what Russia is all about, always was. Russia will never accept western liberal marxist BS but it won't turn to fascism either. The only good thing about their state is that if Europe turns fascist they probably won't care this time, unlike USA who always want to intervene.</p>

<p>France was one of those countries that was always on the wrong side too. Their 3rd republic was the most degenerated liberal country at the time. Even their fascist movements (or anything resembling them) seem weird and they always lacked a true charismatic figure. Their cultural nationalism is also annoying and full of snobism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So yeah, eventually Germany became the only European superpower which was fighting for some good purpose, even in WW1 Germany, A-O and Turkey represented some conservative imperial idea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Italy has a cool fascist subculture and culture in general but yeah, you see all sorts of people there. They also have a reputation of being weak soldiers and personally I really can't imagine Italians winning wars.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Would you be proud of WWII victory if you were Russian? Personally I wouldn't be, the fact is that they had much bigger losses, so it turns out fascist forces had more quality and better people. They can't ignore this.</p>
