<p>Sorry I took a while to reply, haven't been on Iron March in a few days. I have seen him but I have not seen him post since I have joined the forum. I quite like Vietnam. I am an staunch anti-communist but communist nations always seem to adopt a form of traditionalism. They have a ridged hierarchy and are socially conservative. In this modern world Lenin or even Ghandi would be called "far-right".  China as well as Vietnam have become more capitalist, perhaps even state capitalist. I would classify them as authoritarian dictatorships they are not communist and are relatively corrupt. Ho Chi Mihn was a really good man, the Vietnam was was a bad idea. Many libtards apposed it but I think that instead of the USA fighting communism overseas they should have fought communism at home. The hippie movement was caused by communists. The Philippines looks like an overtly multicultural country, like Singapore and Malaysia. To my knowledge these nations are traditionalistic(at least more so then European nations) and the different peoples seem to keep to their own ethnic/religious group for the most part. South East Asians seem like a solid people, they seem to be less damaged by international liberalism them most. My favorite Asians are(or were) the Japanese but they are degenerating fast but not at quite the rate Europeans are.</p>
