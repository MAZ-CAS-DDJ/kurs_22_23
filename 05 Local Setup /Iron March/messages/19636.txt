	Vino edgelord too? Or is he more into the "honorouble national socialism" side?<br />
	I'm trying to think what would Luzifer do if he was still around. Wonder what his input would be on Atomwaffen.<br />
	Also Vino was in Dallas wasn't he?<br />
	And Niko is in Canada.<br />
	Pretty close.<br />
	Also all three of your friends are either Serbs or Serboos.<br />
	You into Yugoslavian memes bro?
