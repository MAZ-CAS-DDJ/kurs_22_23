<p>Well met. You certainly didn't scare me. I've been meaning to message you for a while but hesitated because I thought you might be stand off-ish but I am glad you proved me wrong. I am always happy to make friends with a fellow fascist and Nietzschean. Thank you for the long message. As you may have noticed from my brief posts on here I struggle to find much to say but since you took the time to share your thoughts with me I shall attempt to return the favour. </p>
<p>You say you live in SA? That is most exiting to me! Whereabouts are you located? I'm in Hahndorf, myself. </p>
<p>I find your pessimism about Australia some what discouraging but it's the truth isn't it? We seem to be a nation of self hating whites. Most of my friends are apolitical. I seems like Australian youth just don't care and if they do they are peppy little liberals thinking playing hacky sack will change the world. And this love Aboriginals shit and shoved down our throats. They have their own tv station now which is a joke. We're made to feel guilty for bringing them civilization. I agree we should be careful who we let into our country. I hate this idea that we should open up our borders. </p>
<p>There aren't many nationalist or fascist groups here to join but I am looking into Nationalist Alternative (which is mostly based in Melbourne). They seem okay. When I was younger I was in contact with Blood and Honour but I found them to be a severely disappointing old skin head's drinking club. </p>
<p>As for Nietzsche I was attracted to him from my teenage years but haven't read too much. I plan on starting at Twilight of the Idols tonight.</p>
<p>I hope to hear from you soon. </p>
<p>Cedric.</p>
