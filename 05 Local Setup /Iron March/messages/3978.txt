<p>Cool. I'll have to watch it! I know anime is shunned to an extent on this forum but I really like some of it. I am a big fan of Ghost in the Shell. The first movie and the series are great! There is one film I saw a long time ago that was set in the future if the Axis had won. I remember the protagonist saved a young girl. Maybe you have seen it?</p>
