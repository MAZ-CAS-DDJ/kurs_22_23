<p>That's the thing. They are intellectuals, rather than intelligent. As far as anti-intellectualism goes I follow the same line of thought that Giovanni Gentile and Robert Whitaker do (there's a thread on the subject of anti-intelelctualism on this forum). I am anti-intellectualist when my actual intelligence is being insulted by intellectuals proposing the most retarded things. I'm quite anti-academic too, since that is where the most intellectualism thrives. I unschool my daughter candidly, luckily, I only send her to school for socialization's sake. The best way to bring up someone to oppose the modern order is to let them have a taste of it and decide they don't like it. Never liked school myself either, hated it, it was boring - I learned far more myself through self-tuition that I did in school and I've learned more about life in church in the past couple of weeks than I ever did in school.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, white nationalism didn't help on the matter of coming to Christ, I used to admire Dawkins too. It wasn't until I turned to fascism that I began to see these men for what they really were (spineless sell-outs to leftism), then a turn to Traditional conservatism and in harmony with that, finally Christianity, I only admit myself as a conservative as a matter of convenience. White nationalism is very secular in its politics and in fact very left wing, even if they hate to admit it. It works off the whiny victim mentality rather than actually doing anything. Such a movement can not match up to jewry which while secular on the surface is actually relgious in that it worships the self (humansim), its doctrine is political correctness.</p>
