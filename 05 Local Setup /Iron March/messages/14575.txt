	The scene in Bulgaria and in my part of Sofia is rather pleasant - you can see white pride, swastikas, anti-communism slogans, NS mottos etc - you get the idea everywhere. Even of the headquarters of the random marginal socialist parties here was sprayed with swastikas. Antifags are absolute cowards and completely underground - they have no actions besides when our Lukovmarch takes place they make a counter one and the police pressence is rather strong so their fest can't be really attacked. They are complete FB warriors and from time to time they glue their filthy stickers and ugly slogans. We have some nationalistic organisations  (some of them openly NS, some are kosher rusophiles) - division of Blood and Honour that is active in Plovdiv (2nd largest city) and so on. I will have more free time in the summer and was wondering how to start activism on personal level or let's say small group of people's level. Stickers, facebook, twitter pages, counter-actions against the small antifas ? I haven't been in any such organisation so I decided to make a small one by myself but since I haven't tried something like that was wondering how to start. I am considering self-teaching myself photoshop for the visual part and so on. I can also write on above average level and my german and english knowledge are good. I did some translation work for members of Azov since I can say I have some personal connections there. I was even invited to Ukraine by them but due to lack of communication I won't be able to go. I have some friends in Croatia but mostly communicate with Azovians. Advices are welcome and appreciated!
