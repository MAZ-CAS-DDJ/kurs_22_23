<p>If I chose a regular worker spot would I, in time, be more eligible for a head of department job? </p>
<p>For instance, I think I would be more suited to the imagery or press departments, however I would be happy to try my hand at some video making, I have a YouTube account, so I suppose that's a start. I do have a small amount of video/film experience because I took it for a GCSE about four or five years ago and I got a B.</p>
<p>But I'll see what I can do when it comes to text or videos, if I am not eligible for any head of department job, although I do have a lot of free time at present, I would be happy to take a regular job in the Propaganda Ministry. </p>
<p>Thanks, Ben Barton.</p>
