<p>William speaks true, this has become the sad reality.</p>
<p>By the way, do not be surprised if parts of these conversations come out of the closet someday. These private messages are private only by name, and some people have a concept of honor flawed enough to play Gestapo around ;-)</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>On the bright side there are still some interesting threads and interesting people around, but you have to sift through a lot of stormfront-like mumbo-jumbo.</p>
<p>And internet forums do evolve. This place was a lot different a year ago, it might be very different again only months from now. Users come and go.</p>
