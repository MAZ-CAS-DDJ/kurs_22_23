<p>I have not been posting much recently. There are affirmative action programs in SA. It is getting harder for whites to get jobs. Blacks causes tons of crime and South Africa has one of the highest crime rates in the world.Â  However this crime is not racially motivated. Thousands of whites have been killed in farm attacks. I don't think they are random. I think organized groups are behind them.</p>
