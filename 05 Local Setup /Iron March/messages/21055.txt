	I havenÂ´t heard about that books, so i googled them. From what i red about them I think they are informative about negatives of czechoslovak state(unlike history books we red in school that are idealizing czechoslovakia). Seems interesting to me. Have you red them? And if yes, are there informations about stoping trains with resources for Polaks during soviet-Polish war on czecho(slovako? it sounds weird)-polish border for example? Or just issues like overextnsion and development? Anyway i would like to read at least one of them in future.
