<p>Yeah, looking at it now it's not as bad as I thought it to be. It's more my fault for looking up 'Astral' on Google and proceeding to end up on an article about some women who supposedly tried 'Astral Projection' and ended up with all these weird stories about 'leaving her body during the night'. But yeah the 'Astral Light' as an illusion might make some sense.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It also didn't help that I looked up the Bible's view on Occultist teachings (it regards Hermeticism, Alchemy etc. as Occultism when I checked) and it was against everything Evola wrote including the mention of 'One', no 'Good or Evil' and man becoming a God etc. Not to mention astrology etc. are seen as 'Occult'. So yeah, excuse some of my calling it 'shit', I was legitimately creeped out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I can't remember any mention of the mirror in the Hermetic Tradition but I found it to be a hard read and I probably read it too quick. I'll keep researching and see where this all takes me, although I'll try to stick to the 'left hand path'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>
