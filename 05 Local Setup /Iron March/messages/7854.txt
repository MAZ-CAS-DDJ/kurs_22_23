<p>If you come here or to some city near Slovenia we can meet no problem, I'm a bit short with cash lately though, I can't travel to exotic locations right now. I think you'd like it here considering you like Switzerland, you can meet my crew and other guys from the scene, our parties are quite hardcore, our friends from other European hooligan crews (Young Boys Bern and CSKA Sofia) were always impressed. I'm not sure what your legal status is though and if it's ok for you to travel here. We should definitely meet some day though, if not for anything else to exchange some ideas, I'm planing a lot of things lately.</p>
