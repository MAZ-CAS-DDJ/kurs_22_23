<p>One of the things that you can try to get them to do is baiting them into admitting some weird shit... </p>
<p>... And anonymously email their employer or parents. Of course, you have to know their employer or their parents or have an idea of who they are. </p>
<p>If it was 'real life' stuff, you can possibly send some anonymous email and whatever evidence you have...</p>
<p>While the world is going quite bonkers at the moment, there are probably still enough old conservatives in power that if you send them an email showing one of their employers believes "gender is irrelevant" or some such, you can probably make their life hell for a while. </p>
<p>----</p>
<p>If they do not live in the same town as you, it is still accomplishable but you will have to go undercover somehow and find out about who they are and how to mess with them. </p>
<p>I have never done this, but I know a guy who did and it worked out surprisingly well. </p>
