	I think one got kicked out for being loutmoth, ie. spreading internal matters to ordinary people, and the rest idk. Most of them got into the movement to seek approval for their egos, but when shit hit the fan, they bailed. As of their platform, it's litterally definition of alt-right. "We're not evil nazis, we're orthodox monarchists!". Fuck that. And they are populist in nature, that's why they have any membership at all, they take everyone.
