<p>I intend to really show the kids Uncle Adolf and Codreanu, seeing has he will have some roots in both Germany and Romania. The joys of being a European mutt. I'm just curious what my kid will look like. My wife is a Slav, and I'm a Germanic-Med mix. I'm just glad it's a boy. I can easily make him see how the system doesn't give a single shit about us "cis-types".He'll already know the world is against him. Thanks for the advice.Â </p>
