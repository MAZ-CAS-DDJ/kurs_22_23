<p>And it's not just that they DON'T hear about their own heroes, but that from a young age they're made fully aware of their country's misdeeds (a word not always applicable, imo)- a perfect opportunity for the white guilt to creep in. Nice! I grew up on German cautionary tales about daydreamers walking off cliffs and thumb-suckers having their thumbs cut off... alongside the Bible, because Catholic school. Absolutely. My old priest spent so much time trying to explain the fire and brimstone passages out of existence, and the congregation ate it all up. If a nation has the Jews it deserves, then Medieval Europe must have been a righteous place, considering all the expulsions. It's certainly disgraceful of the U.S., but after every Trump rally-like event, more whites will be radicalised, so it all ultimately serves a higher purpose. To paraphrase someone on that thread, they're doing the heavy-lifting for you.</p>
<p>The 'chaos magick' section of this Tumblr (I know, I know) masterpost is good: breelandwalker(dot)tumblr(dotcom)/post/124449704509/could-you-give-me-some-tips-to-get-started. But if you don't have time to read all the links, this one is the most readable: waningmoon(dotcom)/darkpagan/lib/lib0006(dot shtml)</p>
<p>Your family's like that too? I'm so sorry. Mine are such 'cultured' cowards, it's ridiculous. If after hours of ' Think of the migrant children; you sound like a Nazi' they eventually agree with me on a few points, they're too cowardly to accept that some sort of action must be taken. They'd rather run than fight, claiming it's the smarter option. The 'evil Brits' still cry about their empire, and yet feel no outrage about the Muslim invasions of Europe, even when presented with white slavery, etc. I think whitey's lost all love for his people. How sickening.</p>
<p>It sucks that loving nature is associated with drugged-up degenerates, but c'est la vie. What were you fighting a Slav for? Didn't know they existed in their natural glory in the U.S. of A.</p>
<p>Thanks! I hope I'll earn my place here too. Do you think there are any government people posing as users already? Same. I can talk ok, but cases and structure go out the window. That's what dialect is good for- everything is simply 'da'.</p>
