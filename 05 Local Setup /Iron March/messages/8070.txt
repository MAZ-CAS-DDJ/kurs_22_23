<p>That's not a bad way of looking at it. Craig essentially proved himself unworthy. Therefore the entire Sigurd concept is ours if we wish to take it; and I'm starting to think maybe we do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And yeah, everyone still talks about Sigurd as if it's a still existing thing (despite knowing full well it's not.) If we adopt the concept we automatically leapfrog Matt, or anyone else, in terms of legitimacy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And while I'm picking your brain... what would YOU do differently from the way Craig was doing things?</p>
