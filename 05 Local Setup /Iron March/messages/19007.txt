	Hey young one, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/wordonfirevideo/videos" rel="external nofollow">channel of Bishop Barron</a> if you are interested in Christianity (but ofc ignore his naive and PR views on politics). He talks about many things but he has that rare talent to explain even the more difficult philosophical problems in a clear and easily understandable way. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj0V7JhMJ3w" rel="external nofollow">This</a> is a longer video, but is highly recommended for beginners who are seeing Christianity only through the modern media.
