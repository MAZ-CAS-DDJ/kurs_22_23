	So I have a bunch of guys interested in this and we are considering starting a project. I remember you mentioned you used to do this a few years ago so wondered if you are aware of the legal aspect and how the authorities crack down on this. I am specifically reffering to pretending to be an underage girl online and physically confronting them with a go-pro then uploading the footage.

	I remember there was a channel called 'lets go hunting' and they had to re-edit their videos all the time to blur out faces. Then they dissapeared completely.

	Just had this sent in. Not sure how to proceed. Thinking of creating a separate YT channel, etc.
