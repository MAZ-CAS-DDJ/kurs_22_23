Otherwise we'll do goal specific donation drives announced on the forum for a specific project or purpose. We're about to launch NOOSE so that will require donations as well but its done through the IM donation pool. If you want to donate just for the forum upkeep send as IM Donation. When we announce goal specific donation drives you should mark donations as such so we know that money is for a specific purpose.</p></div></div></blockquote>
