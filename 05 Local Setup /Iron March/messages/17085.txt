	The Hungarian nation was born with the unification of seven tribes somewhere between today's Romania and Donbass (I have heard that most of the Slavic nations were also originated from that region, and our Legends were talking about the nice girls living there). These were the original Hungarians who conquered the territory of historical Hungary, but we have assimilated a lot of people after that, like Avars, Pechenegs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiskuns%C3%A1g" rel="external nofollow">Cumans</a> etc. Even in the 18th and 19th century Germans were coming here and settled in <a href="https://southcarolina1670.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/austria-hungary_ethnic_map.jpg" rel="external nofollow">Western and Southern Hungary</a>. In short, genetically we are very different from the old Hungarians.

	What do the Croatians saying about this issue with their language? Maybe we should invite <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/13338-pokvareni-gad/&amp;do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13338" href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/13338-pokvareni-gad/" rel="">@Pokvareni Gad</a> to another discussion?
