Sadly, Ethiopia fell to communism and it's disasters soon after. The first time I heard the name Ethiopia, I said, "Sounds like a Great Nation." Japan was also a member of the Great Powers, I don't know why we did not see this as an opportunity to ally ourselves with a another non-European Power.</p></div></div></blockquote>

<p>There was also an arrange marriage between the two royal families at one point, the Great Powers also put a stop to it: <a href="http://www.ethiopiaobserver.com/the-marriage-between-an-ethiopian-prince-and-a-japanese-princess/" rel="external nofollow">http://www.ethiopiaobserver.com/the-marriage-between-an-ethiopian-prince-and-a-japanese-princess/</a></p>

<p>That's the Europeans for you. They think they can rule the world, and the rest of humanity are a bunch of "savages", but we had our revenge during the war. Most specifically in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>His Majesty's Army captured approximately 12,621 European Colonial Soldiers from previous battles and put them to work building the Burma Railway. Looks like the enslaver got enslaved. The irony.......</p>

<p>I always supported the idea that, Japanese were the champions of all color peoples, even if it was rhetoric, it was a tool to help weakening European grip on the world. That's why I hope we could be allies in the future. That's if China doesn't get to Ethiopia resources and weaken your influence in Asia.</p>
