<p>By the by I had purchased the Centurion Method a while back and had been practicing via it but on an on and off again basis, between my time at uni before getting tossed and my research I'm for the most part used to a sedentary lifestile and hadn't broken the habbit yet, right now trying to at least simply walk over 15k steps daily to do just that and then move to Centurion Method full time as it struck me as a the exact fitness program that has a fascist undertone, albeit I hadn't read the esoteric exercise expansion pack, but because of you I got a weighted vest and a sledgehammer in a corner of my room next to my flag.</p>
