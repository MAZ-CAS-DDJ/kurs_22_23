<p>Hey. It's good to have you on board here. I've always had a good admiration for Egypt and its culture, not to mention its women who I can't deny are gorgeous, a true example of Mediterranean beauty, which would be a shame to see perish from the world. It's a shame what is going on in your country with all of the muslim activism that will only miscegenate and degrade the nation culturally, spiritually and biologically.</p>
<p>I'm about to make a post in your mediterranean racialism thread. I have no problem with mediterranean pride, what I oppose is medicism like what can be seen on forums such as anthroscape. I am a nordicist, although I adhere to Madison Grant and Richard Lynn, not Arthur Kemp fantasism which claims such absurdities as Ghengis Kahn being predominantly Nordic.</p>
