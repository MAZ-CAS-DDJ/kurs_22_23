<p>Yes, in fact im a member of Golden Dawn.</p>
<p>Peoples reactions towards GD social welfare actions (blood donating for Greeks, food and clothing sheltering) are mixed. Many people see us as a true vanguard defending their rights and helping them and libtards see us as malevolent crooks using nice-appealing strategies, so to "enslave" people, and as criminals substituting the State and the "democratic institutions". There was a big issue about the blood donation, with libtards whining about how evil and unethical that action was, and how it promoted....the evil idea of "racial purity"!!!</p>

<p>Good to know that you support Golden Dawn .</p>
<p>I expected no less coming from those libtards  that always want to bash Nationalist Parties .</p>
<p>If  greek was a democratic country as they claim all liders of Pasok and New democracy already was in jail for all the damage that they did to the country .</p>
<p>In Portugal my country the nationalist party is a joke .</p>
<p>I wish i had another  Ilirias Kasidiaris  in my country .</p>
