	Hi Vasiszta!
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Your idea is very interesting but sadly, just a little part of person could understand this kind of messages... it's too "esoteric" for the people :-) - the CNPA have a popular goal, fr rising the people (for the cleansing of nation, against immigration, jews, western, cultural marxism, etc...)
</p>

<p>
	So, it's nice to see that! I will tell you the principal "texts" "credo" of algerian nationalism . In english (for you) and in arabic and in french, in the poster.
</p>

<p>
	The first is our "credo" (like for Germany "Ein Reich, Ein Volk, Ein Füher" , or for France "Travail-Famille- Patrie" ) for Algeria radical nationalism, it's "Allah- Nation- "Volk"  this credo must appear only in arabic, because it's holy:
</p>

<p>
	<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar"><span>الله</span></span> = Allah
</p>

<p>
	<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar"><span>الوطن</span></span> = Nation
</p>

<p>
	<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar"><span>الشعب</span></span> = Volk (race/people)
</p>

<p>
	Always in the middle and in th top "Allah" , in the left "Nation" and in the right " Volk"  (tell me if you don't understand, because I know my english is sometimes bad, sorry my friend)
</p>

<p>
	Now for the slogan, it's "Algeria for the Algerians" : in the poster it's appears in arabic and french :
</p>

<p>
	in arabic: " الجزائر للجزائريين", in berber: " ⴷⵣⴰⵢⴻⵔ ⵏ ⵉⵟⴷⵣⴰⵢⵔⵉⴻⵏ" (Dzayer N ithdzayrien) and in french "L'Algérie Aux Algériens" 
</p>

<p>
	Ask me if you have any question, and thanks a lot for all this things!
