<p>I've been really busy too cutie pie, I'm sorry it has taken me so dang long to get back to you. Work has been hectic. How are your studies going?</p>

What are your thoughts on technocrats in the Government and industry?</div></blockquote>
<p>If our country is ever going to get things done *right* there's no better way than having business men direct economic policy, foreign policy experts make foreign policy decisions, and restricting the right to vote only to business owners and people who make over a certain amount of money per year. That's the only way to weed out the dummies, know-nothing workers and their intellectual commie advocates.</p>

<p>Half of them or more are about as dumb as a box of rocks and the rest are people who had enough potential to be something a little more but their too lazy and slothful to be bothered doing real work.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="312" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div> To be honest, I almost think education should have higher standards/</div></blockquote>
<p>I couldn't agree more which is why we need to break the teacher's union (which is commie thru and thru) and privatize education so as to increase competition. The only way to bring up quality, as you know, is through market compeition and property rights.</p>

<p>We sure do. Capitalism is a meritocracy and if we solidified the class boundaries and law a little more we would have ourselves a real caste system which would be for the good of the Nation.</p>

I like it's idea of genetic class but not to big on the drugs and sex spread throughout the book..</div></blockquote>
<p>Haven't read it. Heard the names Bakunin and Ford were used and that turned me off right away. Bakunin was a anarcho-dipstick Commie pinhead and Ford was a good businessman but a lousy Capitalist. Let me explain. He was dumb enough to think paying workers more was a good idea because he bought into Keynesian pseudo "logic" hook line and sinker even before Keynse was a big deal.</p>

<p>Well I hope you got to try out that "itsybitsy teenie weenie yellow pooka dot binki" of yours some time soon, darlin. You've earned it.</p>

<p>They ain't going to go and do that because then we would have firm grounds for saying their not true Fascists and Lord knows they don't want that to happen.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="312" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>I think I may want to change one of my Majors, I want to study business administration but I'm not sure if I want to swap out history or economics, your thoughts?</div></blockquote>
<p>History is a fine subject so you might want to stick with it. Economics aren't seriously taught in this country any more - I suggest just watching lectures from the Mises Institute, I learned more in the years I've spent watching them then in my whole time earning my degree in Economics. In business school you'll learn much better and useful information than in economics.</p>

I think they work hard but they are fucking idiotic and need to drop their pinko shit, how do we do that</div></blockquote>
<p>The best way to deal with the working class is by outlawing unions, banning the Democratic Party and all Socialist and Communist Parties, abolishing a minumum wage, and getting them off of the government's tit. Do away with big government hand outs and things would be a lot better for the nation. They don't work hard, some of them do for sure, but a beaner migrant worker works 50x as hard and a Chinese worker 200x. They need discipline. Managers need more authority, labor laws need to be dropped, and we need a return of debtors prison.</p>

<p>That's because the Commie doesn't want you knowing that it's a bunch of malarkey. Communism is based off that crapola and they don't want you knowing that it has been refuted time and again.

<p>Any way, I'm happy as heck to hear from you again. I hope you've been doing well. Keep your chin up, because we're going to defeat these clowns! Look forward to hearing from you again.</p>
