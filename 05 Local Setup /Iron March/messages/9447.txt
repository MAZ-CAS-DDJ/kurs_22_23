<p>I don't see the fault, yes coalburning is bad but it was obviously brief and socially pressured. The thing that matters is you woke up, became a fascist, understood the problem at hand. I've done shameful shit too, sexting included (hellooo 9th grade). Sounds like a cliche but don't let it define you, improve, move on.</p>
<p>I couldn't give less of a shit about what you have done, you're a beautiful and intelligent lady and everything I've said before still stands. I love your oscillations between sweetness and edginess, I love these convos, I want to know you and feel you. Remember that no matter what you have done, you are still in a category far above the rest. </p>
<p>Feel better. &lt;3</p>
