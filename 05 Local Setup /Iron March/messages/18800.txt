	Thanks for the suggestion. I understand women don't have the same roles here but it would be nice to have our own way to help. It's been hard for me to accept the roles of women in this view as I have been liberal until now. I'm not sure how to get anything going as I  honestly don't know anyone to 'recruit' but I'll stay open to the idea for sure. Thanks for the support!

	If your wife does form a female group or the likes, I'd love to know.
