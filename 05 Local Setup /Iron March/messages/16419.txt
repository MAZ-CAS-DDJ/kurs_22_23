	Good evening, brother! I hope this message finds you well.
</p>

<p>
	I'm sending this message because I wanted to let you know what a profound impact you've had on me through your podcast, Mysterium Fasces. I shall try to stay concise. I was born aÂ Catholic and was quite devout in my childhood. In my early teens, I began to stray from the Faith and even had a brief period as a fedora-tipper. I'm now seventeen. I became hooked on your podcast from the first episode and it has inspired me to reassess Catholicism. I cannot thank you enough for helping to provide me with some much-needed spiritual guidance.

	Ave Maria

	P.S. Swedes are the true inheritors of the Eastern Roman Empire. It says so right here in my copy of Mein Kampf, page 266 of the Svenson translation.
