<p>Strangely enough it was reading George Lincoln Rockwell and Ben Klassen's stuff that got me into an interest of free market economics, these were true white racist men who saw that right is right. Socialism in the way that the Nazis saw it simply meant organized society and was used in a time when the term socialism was popular; for the most part Hitler was a capitalist and private businesses and the average German man (and woman- within natural reason) had more freedom then they had ever had or have today; although economically it wasn't perfect, it just goes to show that Fascism (Nazism just being the German version) has nothing in common with the left, it did not have the same victim complex surrounding it, action was taken.</p>
<p>Good points you've brought up concerning stock swindlers, they align with my own thoughts.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying Human Action so far.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I was reading up on Chicago economists and their works and I came across one in particular which made me jump for joy and confirmed my convictions about slavery in the US. Yet another attack on the leftist/victim/nigger bullshit that niggers in the south were had it hard. I've posted articles before in praise of slavery and put it into a more objective light to dispell the leftist self-loathers and guilt trippers, but this one in particular sounds fucking amazing. It's called <em>Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery</em> and it's written by Robert William Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman. You've probably heard of it or perhaps even own it.</p>

<p>It basically dismisses all the liberal myths and the economic myths of how hard and exploited niggers were in the South. I usually find that I later stumble across things that align with what I already think.There's a lot of bullshit leftists spew about the south and while any self-respecting nationalist and racist doesn't give a shit what leftists think or any dead niggers, it's always good to rub salt in the wounds and show liberals up for the liars they are and attract those spectators on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Here's some truth about lynching:</p>

<p>I live in Britain but I have an admiration and fondness for the South. Every Southerner I have had the pleasure of meeting has been friendly, reasonable and smart.</p>
