<p>In a Monarchy, is it necessary for the monarch to be viewed as empowered through divine right or can(or should) the monarchs reign be viewed on personal merit and secular. Furthermore, wouldn't the belief that the ruler was chosen by god to rule relieve the monarch from the duty of actually ruling? If he is placed there by god himself, why would he need to do anything for anyone? His sole duty is to exist and ensure the nation and monarchy exists during and after his reign. He would have no reason to ensure the happiness and prosperity of his people, only his monarchy.</p>
