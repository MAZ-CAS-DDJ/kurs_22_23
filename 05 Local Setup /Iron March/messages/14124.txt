			IMO, you can't get any better than <abbr title="National Action"><abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr></abbr> and I talked to Benjamin a few times... very great guy. If I was a brit, i'd join it in a new york minute. I don't care about what the media says about them.

	I agree, and I agree with Ben that this nonsense of respectability and playing by the enemies rules is a recipe for failure. You can never be respectable in politics as long as you're 'racist' in this country, which renders politics impossible as he says. Therefore you need to change what is deemed acceptable, that is the only solution realistically. I don't understand these Joe Owens cunts who say that <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> is a state OP, they never say why they think that the strategy which failed completely with the BNP will work this time round for some reason. The BNP's aesthetics were total shit, they were never going to inspire any sort of passion in the people that way. <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> is the obvious solution in principle, though I do think they could improve their image a bit by behaving a bit more like adults, make proper roman salutes, be respectful of monuments etc.
