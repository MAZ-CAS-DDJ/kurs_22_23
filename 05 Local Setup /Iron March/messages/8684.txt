<p>This is the MMA video at the moment. We are all handwringing if we have done enough to obscure the faces. What we did was a blur on anything too obvious and also blurred the footage itself enough that there can be no positive ID's. We have also blurred out the club logo.<br><br>The debate was whether the blurry contours of people's faces are too much. Would you like to give your opinion?</p>
