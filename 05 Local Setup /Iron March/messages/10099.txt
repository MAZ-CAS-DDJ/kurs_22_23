I wouldn't say Hinduism influenced European religion, more that it comes from the same ultimate source, the PIE (Proto-Indo-Europeans). That religion of course we know nothing of, but Hinduism Hinduism is the oldest form of it that we know of. I think of Hinduism like a close cousin who is much older and therefore resembles the parent a little more.</p></div></blockquote> <p>I do not read much of him either but he basically says that we are stuck in the "kali yuga" he almost never talks about the european paganisms he only talks about the hindu roots, still im sceptical but ill look deeper into it</p>
