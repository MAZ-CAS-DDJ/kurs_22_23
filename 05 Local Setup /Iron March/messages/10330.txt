<p>Hey, whats up? </p>
<p>Been a bit curious about something. You said a while back that ''something'' will happen soon back in a skype chatt. Considering there's so much talk about September and the ''Shemitah'' or whatever, what do you make of it being well read about astrology and all. </p>
<p>Cheers man, have fun on the countryside if you're still there.</p>
