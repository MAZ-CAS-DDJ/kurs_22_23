	Thanks for coming to me with this. I am going to take the situation regarding your father's job security as is. It is up to you to judge if these measures are necissarry.
</p>

<p>
	There is a certain degree of risk in everything - but you can minimise that to nothing. Canada also seems pretty chill - despite the shitstorm she caused Evalion has continued to evade identification.
</p>

<p>
	1. Get someone to take risk for you, eg have any website in their name and run the group's social media.
</p>

<p>
	2. There is basic anonymity. If you can use TOR, always wear a ballcap and sunglasses on activity - just pretend you are autistic or otherwise have a reason for it. You don't have CCTV, though the inside of buildings and ATMs pointing out into the street will.
</p>

<p>
	3. Don't shit in your back garden - don't do anything like sticker in an area people will recognise you. Try and take it at least 5-15 miles. 
</p>

<p>
	4. If you are out of the house problem solved. Even if your dad is president of the NAACP your politics is only a threat to his job through virtue of the fact that he is putting  a roof over your head. When you are gone you have complete deniabilty. If that isn't the case changing your second name officially will also sever you from family. 
</p>

<p>
	Run through the activities you are doing and likely scenarios that could occur where people want to identify you and how they can identify you based on your situation. If you are not planning on being the head honcho, speaking for the group, or being arrested then you don't even need to take most of these measures. So far practically none of our guys have lost public anonymity, only those who willingly gave their names, were slack on social media, or were personally betrayed.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously your situation is better if your family don't mind the fact that you have your opinons. I assume they won't mind you going out and making new friends or maybe getting stuff in the mail. 
</p>

<p>
	Starting up is the hardest part because you will be putting yourself out there to meet new people. Don't give them compromising information unless you are fairly sure they are on the level and that they won't fuck you over.
