<p>Your country hosts thousands of Syrian Arabs in state of the art facilities, 200 of your ethnic kin shouldn't be a problem. Why has the government shown such reluctance?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Who knows why. The current Government did some things that did not occur to the previous governments, like they visited Eastern Turkestan to meet the Uyghur people. However it was all a show, and nothing more than a priviliage granted by the Chinese to those that had made their customary bows to the Emperor that the Chinese now call "Chairman". So, as with the Inönü single-party regime that handed Turkish refugees to the Russians to be butchered, they too would have let the Uyghurs rot in Thailand, if the public outcry did not stop them from doing so.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I do remember seeing an article about that incident, but it didn't say that these Turks were Uyghurs, it makes sense now. Say, what do you think of the current AKP government in Turkey?</p>

<p>The real problem is that these immigrant groups are so tightly packed, they are resistant to the assimilation tactics of the American state that has employed these ever since its creation. The worst thing that can happen to a country is when a minority accumulates at a certain spot, and begins to grow like a tumor, being harmful while using national resources. The only thing to determine here is whether the tumor is malignant or benign.</p>
<p>In the first case cutting it off from your body might be the only choice, of course, if it has not grown beyond a point where surgical interference is not life threatening to the country. In the second case, you might also let the tumor be in there instead of going through the lenghty surgical procedure, as the growth is stagnant, though it still leaches off of the resources of the country while giving nothing back.</p>

<p>The illegal immigration of Mexicans, or Mestizos rather, represent a unique threat to the American state. Many of them believe that they are taking back the American Southwest, which they consider to be their ancestral homeland<span> <em>Aztlán</em>, from the Americans. </span>There is no factual basis for such a myth, but they are not advocating the return of these lands to Mexico - instead, they intend to create a new state. This is because the Mestizos are disenfranchised in Mexico, and one need only to look at a Mexican TV channels, or the portraits of their most recent Presidents, to conclude that the White element there is dominant. Instead of trying to overthrow minority rule, the illegal immigrants will demand from America the same privileges and cultural recognition they were denied back in Mexico, and the Mexican government is perfectly happy to dump their poor and indigent here (I don't believe the Mexicans have had a decent President since the indigenous Benito Juarez).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Much has been made about the illegal immigrants' apparent willingness to work hard, and do the jobs Americans allegedly won't, but as far as I'm concerned, all that amounts to nothing if they've already broken the law by entering illegally. We should neither tolerate their presence or their continued exploitation by corporations and businesses. Besides, their children will most likely be converted into America-haters by the education system or by association with the lowest classes of American Mexicans (I hold them distinct from the illegals, but a minority of them support the <span><em>Aztlán </em>idea).</span></p>

<p>Well, once the "victim" always the victim. The Jews also cry persecution at every occasion, and so do they. But unlike the Jews, that encourage their brethren to return to their ancestral homeland, the Armenians don't want them, else they would cut off the significant vein that supplies them with the necessary nutrients that Armenia needs to be.</p>
<p>However, Armenians lack the inherent drive to oust foreign elements like the Jews, so they are more susceptible to outside influence than Jews, and are quick to use the victim mentality as a way to instill such a drive inside their brethren. "White Genocide" they have called it, so that their kin might show a reaction.</p>
<p>But they won't go back. For they lack another thing that the Jews do have. The Jew's notion of a "homeland" is part of their national identity. The Armenians lack this one too, so no Armenian would ever leave the lukewarm conditions of the western world for the harsh and rough existence of the Caucasus. They probably would not even get along well with their more fatalistic and burly kin in Armenia due to the extremes in their outlook on life.</p>

<p>Many have migrated from Armenia, but I doubt they wish to return.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for the Jews, I believe one who is loyal to World Jewry cannot be loyal to anything else, and there are Jewish organizations fear and oppose the assimilation of American Jews through marriage (which is no longer working to their advantage), lest it dilute their influence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They are now even paying for young American and Canadian Jews to go on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthright_Israel" rel="external nofollow">trips</a> to Israel, where they will be indoctrinated and encouraged to fornicate (anything for more Jewish babies!).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the state of Israel itself, I do respect them to an extent, but I feel that they put themselves in a volatile position, and must live with the consequences. Concerning Israel, my views are not much different from those of your ideologue Atsız:</p>
