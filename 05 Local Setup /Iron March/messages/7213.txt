<p>Look at him playing with the tree! Aww, those bears make me smile <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> Thanks for the compliment on the nickname.<br /><br />Well, I haven't got a skype, but when I do I would like to add you! I appreciate the help with Croatian. We have a Balkan Market in the next town, I like to go there sometimes and listen to them speak. Better even when I can speak Croatian myself, I will get there.<br /><br />I have big hopes for them too. They have not as much of a desire to trust their government, less of that old idealism about democracy. I just finished high school, and while I wasn't using the word 'fascist', I was very open about my views during class discussions. In psychology, I once said I didn't believe people were equal, and the teacher got visibly upset. It was really surprising considering he was a man. But anyway, all these people agreed. And that's just one example. We're not as bad off as I think about. But as for the Marxist education, is it very bad in Slovenia? I always imagine Balkans as having less of that sort of thing.</p>
