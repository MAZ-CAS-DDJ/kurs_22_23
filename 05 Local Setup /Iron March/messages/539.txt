<p>I don't really care about occidentalism that is more the liberal-christian-zionist thing, for me a territorial unity and an ethnical homogeneity  is better. White population from non european countries would be repatriated, we have a lot of desert but habitable eastern territories with actual russia.</p>
<p>But as you know it's only idealism, more an intelectual reference, not the reality, if we had a chance on a million to concretise it, we had to do with the reality of the moment. And i think that america (his government and mentality) always will be the enemy of Europe, Russia, Socialism, Nationalism and non-ZOG states, so we would oppose a strong imperial unity.</p>

<p>What kind of power would the statelets have in relation to the empire as a whole?</p>
<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I don't really know, in reality there is not only two level but much more, in my conception :</p>
<p>The empire, then little ethnical nation or subdivision from ancient historical state, after some regionals subdivision again, then the city (like in ancient greece, or in the middle age italy or germany), then the community such as neighborhood or factory, and then the family.</p>
<p>And between empire and little nations, we could imagine some cultural contract amoung little states.</p>
<p>Empire would have some kingly power : foreign affairs, internal diplomacy, army, the coordination of the socialist economy (exchange between litle states about energy for example), maintain the integrity of the Empire, ethnical problems, and an influence in culture and politics but not more.</p>
<p>After we would articulate all this level with the subsidiarity princip, with a relative auto self direction for neighborhood and factory, then for the city, etc. A system of russian doll.</p>

<p>Also, I saw you listed Indo-European in your list of groups included in the empire would this include Indians and Persians?</p>
<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I don't go so far like the Eurasism theory from Douguine.</p>
<p>- Indian are in their religion spiritually indo-aryan, (japanese too) but the race definitively not. And adopt more than a billion of dark skin poor is not really suitable.</p>
<p>- Iranien are also too far from the aryan biological reference, and they are not even paganist but muslim.</p>
<p>If i extend to finno-ugric, it is because they are ethnically, geocraphically, biologically and spiritually europeans, even if in theory not aryan roots.</p>
<p>For caucasians and turkic it is more for a conveniant mesure, because there is a lot of them in geographical russia/ex-USSR, and i want to extend to khazakstan (a lot of territory unhinabited but habitable, and some energical resources) and Armenia (aryan people).</p>
<p>We would have some alliance contract and economical relations from neighbors states, like buffer states in the roman empire : maghreb, turkey, iran, india, china and japan. A geopolitical union against the rest of the world (with also free latin america like the actual venezuela of chavez why not?) perhaps but not in the Empire.</p>
<p>It would be a very strong opposition against ZOG, america and mondialisation, and no more care about africa.</p>

We don't have very many people here willing to argue the case for stateless nations. Do you speak the Breton language?</div></blockquote>
<p>Ya, un tammig evit plijadur. (yes,a little with pleasure)</p>
<p>We have no state until we always have "historical states", but the wheel of time turn. It's not "regionalism" (autonomy but still beyond the historical state) but real nationalism-separatism against historical states, and federalism with the Empire.</p>
<p>Are you canadian ? Most of my family live over there.</p>
