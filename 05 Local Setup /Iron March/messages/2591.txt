<p>I think Basque is the only surviving proto-european and I remember reading how the fringes of western europe share an unchanged genetic make-up similar to the Basques. Central Europe I think was roughly 50-50 proto-euro and IE and the Slavs and Scandinavians were the most but not exclusive IE. I must re-find that source.</p>
