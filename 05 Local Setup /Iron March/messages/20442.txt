	Whoops, thought I sent a message a while ago but apparently it didn't send.Â

	Thanks for your reply, yeah we decided not to do an action report last month, and hopefully this month we'll have a lot more. We tried making a banner by hand, but since we're in winter at the moment the bloody thing isn't drying.

	In your view, how many people do you need for a flash demo/counter demonstration? We were thinking 15-20.

	Also, in a big city, how do you get away afterwards? We could do a counter demonstration in Melbourne CBD but it's a concrete jungle, and if we really annoy antifa they could well come after us for quite a long time. Not quite sure how the cops are here towards NS things, but Melbourne is extremely left wing, so they might cause trouble too.
