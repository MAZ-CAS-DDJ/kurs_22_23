	It's apparent that we're going to need to have a chat. I'm on Discord or if you'd prefer to talk here that's fine too. I'm not entirely sure what you think is going on but I woke up this morning with my phone blowing up over some allegations of Doxing. Let me make this perfectly clear: I have no interest in continuing whatever drama AW and AV had together, I have no interest in drama period. Everyone has been instructed to drop any personal feelings or autism they have and I have had friendships with people in AW. I have no interest in doxing you or anyone else in your group.

	It seems evident to me that someone has tried to impersonate me and there are only a few select people who had knowledge of AU. I would probably look over your newest recruits because I have a feeling I know who is responsible for this but I have no solid evidence.
