<p>Dear Scheissekopf,</p>
<p>This is Blackshirt 13 here. I just wanted to settle the feud we were having earlier. I also just wanted to ask if you actually thought that I'm gay, because I am not. However, I want you to answer this question truthfully, so we can move on and stop this stupid fight. Also, if I have anointed or offended you in any way, then you can unfriend me. I do hope that you will not do that however. Please let me know as soon as you get this.</p>
<p>Hail,</p>
<p>Blackshirt 13</p>
<p>PS PLEASE GIVE ME A REAL (NON-JOKE) ANSWER.</p>

<p>Hmm. Might have to get back to you on the first question. I'm slightly concerned, just because I've had... let's say, similar experiences with men who ended up being homosexual. I'll take your word for it though, if you're sure you're not, then you're not.</p>
<p>. As for offense, no offense taken xD.</p>
