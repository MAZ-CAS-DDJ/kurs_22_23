<p>When Richard first contacted me he seemed to be a sincere nationalist who was looking for help. I had no reason not to believe that this wasn't the case. So I gave him my word that I would help him. As I said in the thread, that's something I would do for anyone who's motives appear legit.</p>
<p>It wasn't until recently that I came across some of the old threads on IM that had to do with the history between you and him. If I had known then what I know now I would not have partaken in this venture, because as I told him on some messages we exchanged on Facebook, that despite being overly brash I do have a lot of respect for your opinions and knowledge, and for IM as an educational tool for the movement. Now saying that, I have given my word to help do whatever I can within reason to make Nationalist Podia a success. Given Richard's history you're right it will probably fizzle out within a few months, but I will still try nonetheless. As far as the grudge accusation is concerned it was placed at a time when I was pissed; there was no evidence to back it up, it was made purely on emotion, that is why shortly afterwards I withdrew the accusation. I apologize for it.</p>
<p>The only complaint I have about IM is that you have quite a few people here who do a disservice to the movement by calling every other Black a nigger, and every other Jew a kike, while I'm not a sympathizer of either group there are more productive ways to go about expressing your ideas. Like it or not what you're leading here is a movement, not a discussion forum. As an analogy use a sports star such as David Beckham, he may not think of himself as a role model but millions look upon him like that, so in essence that is what he is. When perception becomes dominant enough it becomes reality whether we want it to or not.</p>
<p>All I'm trying to do is to help create a better world for my children and their children. I'm sorry if you don't take me seriously and think I'm here to just joke around. I can assure you this is not the case. I realize i'm going to make mistakes in this process and offend people but that is the price to be paid for trying to change the world. There are going to arise occasions when what I'm doing will be perceived as conflicting with or impeding the progress of another aspect of the movement but my motives will always be genuine . I hope to continue working with you and Iron March to see our vision become reality. If that's not what you want then I wish you the best in your future endeavors, for whether you want to acknowledge it or not we're on the same side.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
