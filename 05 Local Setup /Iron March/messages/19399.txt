	Well, I see it as a way for a resistance/partisan movement to rise in the North during ACW2/RaHoWa, sabotaging Federal infrastructure. Other than that, pan-secessionism sounds useful for areas like Cascadia and the Rust Belt (look into the Amerikaners and their attempt to create an organic Midwestern German-American culture). The KGC I would see as an order for the general wellbeing of Dixie, made up as a secret society of influential men.
