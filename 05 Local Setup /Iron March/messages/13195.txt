	Alright, sounds good. Try and get Skype up and running, it's the basic requirement for networking and communication (non-sensative info obviously) within the organisation. We've really been growing and thriving for the past week and a half, we would love to have more like minded individuals such as yourself on board.  I am going to sleep for a bit now, but I will keep in contact with you. I use Iron March frequently, and I welcome you dearly to Iron March. Have a nice night, hail victory.
