	Thanks! Any of these books available through Barnes and Noble? That is primarily were I get my books from. With that being said it will probably be a while before I can read any of these, maybe even a year, because my reading list is huge and I am always reading something (in case you couldn't tell by my posts in the What are you reading thread and the Trivial Happenings thread) because there are a lot of books I want to read during my life :)

	PS The next book that I am about to read is The Necronomicon by H.P. Lovecraft
