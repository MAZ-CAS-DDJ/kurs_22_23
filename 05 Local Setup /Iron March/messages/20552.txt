	Nice try FBI. Nah but seriously I wouldn't mind some vigilantism. Especially with drug dealers, those people deserve to be gunned down. I won't go into things too deeply but let's just say that drugs have affected people around me. I'm in Indiana which has somewhat of a meth problem but my area also has heroin too. You can thank the mestizos for that one. Seriously fuck the illegals where I live. My area is actually pretty okay compared to other areas in the state. Gary Indiana should be purged. You live in Nebraska right? I wouldn't think they have as much of a drug problem.
