	Why would anyone in their right mind call themselves an "intellectual satanist" since those two words combined are an oxymoron, one heck of a contradiction and pretty darn retarded to boot.John 3:16 tells us thatÂ God so loved the world that he gave His only begotten son Jesus Christ who defeated Satan and removed our shakles of damnation by His precious blood. Satan wants only to further separate us from God and spread wickedness and confusion so that all things that are beautiful and righteous will be corrupted. Repent.
