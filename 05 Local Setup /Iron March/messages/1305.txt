<p>Hi there. It's fine.</p>
<p>Look, I'l get a thicker skin using alchohol and medication. </p>
<p>"Not a hugbox?" Right, I agree, I just hope that users can be more adult than just be trolls. </p>
<p>As far as getting offended, my whole political goal is to stop this from happening (at least to Americans) by ANY means necessary. Even if it means removing socially unstable individuals from society or putting them down. I know alot of people have their opinions and like to debate things online, but I want to actually put my ideas into practice here in my own country. Once I get the funding and a few people who share my ideas (even if I have to convert some liberal forum users to stand for violent action) I plan to start a new political party. America has decayed because of all the conflicting viewpoints that are allowed to just exist together. It won't work in the long run. In fact, it hasn't worked. Liberal social rights,  to me at least, seem like a logical outlet for citizens to exercise freedom, while fiscal, military, and patriotic matters need to be handled in a Fascist manner. I am interested in learning your thoughts on this and what you believe is right or wrong. </p>
