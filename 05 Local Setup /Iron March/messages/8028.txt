<p>He trying get the peoples approval by being hip, trying to sell Catholicism to the heathen masses, what he dosen't know is that he is catering to Atheists and making Christianity even more of a joke. The Atheists want the Chruch gone, no matter how hard it tries to be liberal. That's why the Chruch needs a huge reform and take it back to the fire and brimstone days, one where the Chruch are strict on child abuse from priests and they actually care for the monarchy and poor.</p>
