<p>Combine Dark Angels and Space Wolves in a Kill Team for special drama <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You could also open the "Yo Primarch"-can, for example:</p>
<p>"Yo Primarch was so fat, he couldn't even fit in a ship thrice the size of your Chapter's Battle Barge!"</p>
<p>"Yo Primarch was so stupid, he once played Tic-Tac-Toe with an ork, and lost!"</p>
<p>"Yo Primarch was so fat, he would have just eaten the planets before the tyranids could!"</p>
<p>etc...</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Or for general drama, throw in some Blood Ravens, they steal everything that's not bolted to the ground and are most likely descended from Magnus the Red <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
