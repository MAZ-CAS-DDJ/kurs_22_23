	Hello, I believe I owe you an apology for my behavior on that White Lives Matter - Austin, TX thread. I have my reasons for my behavior but I do not feel they excuse it whatsoever, and an explanation is in order but I'll spare that for another time unless you're really interested in a giant wall of text of drama. I will say this, I wasn't told that the "equal justice" slogans would be shown there, and I pleaded that we amp up our approach to be far more radical. While others agreed, it wasn't the case at all.

	Long story short, you were right, I knew it even when we argued but I was still full of adrenaline after dealing with the mess.
