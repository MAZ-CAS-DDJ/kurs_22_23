	Hello Palmer,
</p>

<p>
	I saw your post looking for people in Wisconsin. I'll be in WI at least through December and I'd be open to meeting up and doing something. I'm at the capital, but I have my own place and transportation, so I can be elsewhere. If you'd like to go through some sort of interview process before meeting, that would be fine with me. But I'm also willing to just meet you for lunch at some point.

	Best,
