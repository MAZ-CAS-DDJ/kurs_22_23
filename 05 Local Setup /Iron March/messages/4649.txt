<p>I'll put it into a nutshell the main points to help a long the way:</p>
<p>Avoid catholicism like the plague, they act as Jewish as Jews. Know how the Jews like to refer to the Talmud? Well catholics barely refer to the bible, they refer to the catcheism. These very kind of people were the people whom Christ rebuked for following traditions of men, rather than higher, older and more rich tradition of God. Keeping that in mind alone the dogma of Catholicism crumbles.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that a lot of people take what they like out of the bible and leave what they don't like; this is because of their own standards, it can either be influenced by political correctness or they are just a downright scumbag. They are lovers of themselves and maintaining their own ego (there's no way they can be morally wrong) rather than lovers of God. Some Christians infact try to take out and just forget about the entirety of the Old Testament, which is quite funny when really all the New Testament does regarding moral laws and everything else is quote from the Old Testament. A classic example is that "Love thy neighbor as how you love thyself" was originally in Leviticus 19:18 (yeah, the same Leviticus which condemns faggotry and all that other sick shit). Orthodox Christianity and most pious protestants make no dualistic distinction between the Old and New Covenants, because they do not differ in terms of their nature, but simply in terms of their ministry. God is and has always been the heavenly Father of the faithful (Is. 64:8). As a godly earthly father who loves his children not only blesses them, but also disciplines them, it is the same in our relationship with God, of which the earthly father is to be a type (Prov. 3:12). Various texts in the Old Testament point to Godâ€™s dealing with His children in this way. Myself and Mierce touched on this stuff in the following thread:</p>

<p>TL;DR: The moral laws of the old testament still apply, the ceremonial laws such as no mixing fibres, sowing with different seeds, eating shellfish and sacrificing animals was abolished by Christ's sacrifice. Everything else still stands, however.</p>
<p>A main point to consider is this: The ancient Israelites are not the Jews of today. Jews today have a common origin, it's not just as simple as Khazars converting to Judaism and becoming the new Jews. They are all Near Easterners, they are Edomites. What came to be known as the Ashkenazim went into Khazaria and obtained their mongolid component from these Turko-Mongoloid people and then of course they moved into Europe and then Israel, intermarrying and gene hijacking in the process. The sephardim are a lot closer to the original, but they are still not the Israelities, they are Edomites (descended from Esau) who went into Northern Africa and Southern Europe, picking up slight negroid admixture as well as mongoloid. I made a more indepth post about this here, I discuss what the term Jew actually means:</p>

<p>It all just started to make a lot of sense to me and add up.</p>
<p>I came across Cornelius Van Till and Rushdoony and that helped a hell of a lot, especially in regards to answering "trip up questions" that the atheists think are clever like "how can a religion not known about by some people in the world be a true religion". Besides hanging by a moral hinge (which is actual the main extent of a lot of atheistic polemics - Dawkins God Delusion comes to mind as I type this; a very unimpressive book) these were answered here:</p>

<p>It was my interest in history at first which opened me up to religion and Evola blew the lid on it completely opening me up to spirituality, a three degrees outlook; material, soul and spirit. You have to have an interest and a deep love of learning of the religion, its message and its history before you can start to become faithful. It's hard because of language barriers, different translations and the like, it takes a lot of dedication and research if you're anything like me. It's not as if Christianity is a no fun allowed religion like I originally thought it was, it meets the criteria of all of the values and outlook I identify with.</p>
<p>Bibles are tricky things, without Strong's Concordance withHebrew and Greek Lexicon interpreting the true message of the bible can be very difficult. Needless to say, I'm not fond of the KJV, which adds to confusion by adding words which should not be there into the bible. I mainly refer to the 1599 Geneva bible (I personally find Calvin's commentary in it to be interesting at times too) and then Young's Literal Translation, New International Version, Tyndale bible and the Septuagint. Rarely do I refer to the KJV, as I call it the knock-off jew version, lol. As I said, it's a lot of work and a lot of research, I still have regular discussions with fellow Christians myself.</p>
<p>If you've got any more questions or something particular just ask. and good luck.</p>
