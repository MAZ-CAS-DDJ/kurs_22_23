			Cool that you're trying to make a difference.<br /><br />
			As for your philosophy, people here may disagree. The general view here is that people can't be convinced with good deeds and reason with the system still in place. Everything is rigged against us, so it may prove useless to be anything other than purely militant.<br /><br />
			However, every country's situation is different. In Western and Northern Europe (as well as in America), it seems that the people are lost and cannot be retrieved through any other means except through a brutal awakening.<br /><br />
			But in Eastern and Southern European countries, for instance, people are still generally socially conservative. This makes it possible for more civic movements to rise, such as Golden Dawn and Casa Pound.<br /><br />
			One is a political party which helps communities through charity and security against violent migrants, the other is a counter-culture among the youth which hopes to be a political party one day.<br /><br />
			These groups work for their respective homes, but could you imagine such movements in America? Or Britain? They'd get shut down not just by the government (which is expected), but also by their own people.<br /><br />
			I would recommend reading some threads such as the American Futurism Workshop (<a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/3805-american-futurism-workshop/#comment-82247" rel="">http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/topic/3805-american-futurism-workshop/#comment-82247</a>) to get what exactly I mean. Unique circumstances and all that.

	Sure, I don't want to impose my philosophy !
</p>

<p>
	And of course I know that being no-violent will, sometimes, change nothing (I mean that WE HAVE to do things sometimes to make what we want happend, even if I love to play the jew's game to fuck them  )
</p>

<p>
	But of course I agree with 100 % IM point of view (but I am not blinded by hate, even if I have a lot of it )
</p>

<p>
	You are completly right about our society being brain washed.
</p>

<p>
	Today I tried to explain was holocaust's history is so weirdly made, I explained everything and "downed" all of their arguments against nazism.
</p>

<p>
	I stood calm but they all started to say "You fucking racist man, how the fuck can you support hitler ? bla bla" and I calmy answered : " I may be the racist here, but I ain't be the violent one"
</p>

<p>
	and after that ? One of my friend went to see me to talk about the jews dominating europe (one of my primary argument) and he was a lot interested ! So I'm quite glad there !
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	I do not lose hope for our community, even more know I know french far-right activist are a lot more present that what I tough.
</p>

<p>
	AND EVEN, if our people do not wake up, then, once white race is going to be extinct, our fellow white descendant will say : "Maybe, they were true finally ". And those are going to be white race last words (And obviously will happend)
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	The first thing anti-nazi say as an argument is : "6 000 000 jews man come on" and then I keep on with : "not 6 000 000 but 1 000 000" and destroy them about the fact that gas chamber never existed (Why using this obsolete methode when on bullet in head is obviously enough ?). And finish them about the fact that allies bombing killed them causing starving , diseases etc .
</p>

<p>
	One said : What about the photos ? you are going to tell me they are photoshopped ? (they all laugh)
</p>

<p>
	I show them this : <img alt="NYT-HOLOCAUST-FRAUD-3-Copy.jpg" class="ipsImage" src="http://incogman.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NYT-HOLOCAUST-FRAUD-3-Copy.jpg" /></p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	they were really embarassed . ;)
</p>

<p>
	I don't know if what we are doing is right
</p>

<p>
	I don't know if we are on the right side
</p>

<p>
	Maybe we are fully wrong ? maybe we are just assholes ?
</p>

<p>
	But what I know is, if we have the true, then, it's just a matter of time.
