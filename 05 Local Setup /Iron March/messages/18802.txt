	well it doesn't have to be a video, but we can do that as well.<br /><br />
	The idea is to give a podcast format to it so some yanks can listen to it while doing other stuff. The quotes would just have to be made to stand out somehow, maybe with some signal noise or some effect we can add to the voice recording.<br /><br />
	Ideally we can make both that and a video which will have the visual aids in it.
