<p>I don't want to mess the topic further, so I decided to use PM.</p>
<p>I apologize for my mistakes, especially with my recent posts in the topic. To be honest, I did not see that it was actually a reply against Ace High's topic. So, I will do my best to be a better member of Iron March. I will think before I post.</p>
