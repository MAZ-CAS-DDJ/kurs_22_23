	Here are free occult and religion libraries I archived. It also has a lot of Abrahamic and Pagan content, whichever you're into.<br /><br />
	The whole point/goal of my religion and of basically ALL ancient pagan/gentile religions and traditions is:<br /><br />
	1. Raise the Kundalini Serpent completely and safely through all 7 chakras. The kundalini Serpent is kundalini in the shape of a serpent coiled three and a half times at the base of your spine. Raising it brings GODHOOD, enlightenment, etc. Kundalini itself is the life-force and very sexual in nature. To make it easier to understand sexual Orgasms are small releases of kundalini energy. <br />
	Satanism &amp; the Kundalini Serpent: <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Kundalini.html" rel="external nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Kundalini.html</a><br />
	2. Complete the Magnum Opus, which is spiritual and physical literal immortality, where you never age. It is perfection of the multi-body complex. There are 13 steps, the 13th step is the hidden one. <br /><br />
	In my faith we can achieve these 2 steps through power meditation. The results of power meditation is a clean aura/soul, aura of protection, I feel great and it makes my day easier after doing power meditation, divination is basically using a diviner tool for example Tarot Cards - I ask the cards a question, shuffle it then whatever cards I choose are my answers and I must interpret it myself. Divination brings me a lot of insight and answers to different things, you can also use divination to communicate with spirits and entities. Entities and spirits have a lot of knowledge to share, they can also protect, guide, bless, etc. you and/or your objects. I work with my ancestors too, planets and trees have much knowledge, company and healing to give. I go astrally inside the Sun or UY Scuti and breathe in their energy into my chakras and soul to cleanse and empower myself, I can program this energy to build an aura of protection around me. The planets are extremely powerful and wise. All of the planets and stars are actually alive not balls of gases as (((science))) tries to make us believe. <br /><br />
	I'm not trying to preach or impose my beliefs on you I'm just explaining what the results of my religion and practices are. <br /><br />
	No I don't know who killed my nephew. I could go back in time astrally specifically at that time to find out and/or void meditate. How could I use lead? <br /><br />
	Sex and love magick can be used for a lot of things. Of course I masturbate whenever I need to, I never ever let any of my sexual energy go to waste, I use and program the sexual energy to empower, cleanse and/or open my soul. Love magick can be used for seducing others. I have only used sex magick on 1 Christian man, it worked but we never did anything. <br />
	Theres also voodoo love dolls but voodoo dolls are dangerous and it never happens the way you want it to. People have died because of this. <br /><br />
	I don't know what to think of Manson I haven't done enough serious research to have an opinion. I know one National Socialist who told me that Manson is his personal idol and that Manson didn't really kill anybody, it was the Jewish controlled media that painted it that way. I wouldn't be surprised if that were true.<br /><br />
	I have read and skimmed through Siege but haven't seriously studied it yet. <br /><br />
