	On one hand, Dugin still contradicts himself when he admits the difference between races but claims that they can't be put in a hierarchical structure. I think I understand what he means here, but everything in this world is already in a hierarchical structure; only we are not always capable to perceive that structure. Think of the races as an alliance - it can't be founded upon equality, because then every time a question comes up there will be a debate on how to answer it, just like in Democracy. True alliances have a common principle, thus a leader, just like Hitler was the leader of Germany and Germany was the leader of the Fascist Axis. This doesn't mean the leaders cannot change in time though.

	On the other hand, I can totally accept what he said about the difference between ultimate freedom and the freedom of the individual. Also he made a great point regarding the fallacy of monotonic thinking.
