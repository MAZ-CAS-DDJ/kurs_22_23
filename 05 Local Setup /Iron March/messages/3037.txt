<p>I think you hit it on the nail.</p>
<p>They want to use this Christian+White as a "catch-all" to galvanize all European-stemmed populations, since they're so afraid of the Muslims and others. In reality such a thing is in itself the Internationalism that they're supposedly against. A Marxism of the Right.</p>
<p>I don't often know if what these people say is correct or not. They read a lot more than I do. They are better informed. But I have one tool, that does not fail me. It is my ability to detect things that are contradictory. You can't promote antisemitism while praying to a Jew. You can't stand against internationalism while promoting it in a different sort of label. They praise National Socialism while National Socialism was anti-christian and merely forestalled a confrontation until hypothetically winning the war.</p>
<p>They're just too western. Even the Russian is too western. I feel like an alien. Am I the only one not wholly poisoned by these ideas? Even yourself, a part-Jew, that should be accordingly to their points the one least capable of understanding such things, get it more than they do, possibly because your complexity forced you to have more than one point of view.</p>
<p>We need neither corrupted west, nor decadent east, nor black south. We need a Northern Civilization. And in the Northern Civilization there will be no room for apologists of the Cross and walking, talking contradictions. Maybe they are part of the problem that we commonly bash here, on the Iron March.</p>
