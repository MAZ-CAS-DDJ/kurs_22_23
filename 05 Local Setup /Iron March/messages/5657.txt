<p>The problem with pagans is that they don't realize paganism doesn't exist outside Catholicism and Orthodoxy and in countries with Protestant heritage it was basically rooted out. When you don't have a continuity with living faith (living tradition), your "faith" is a death thing, especially paganism of which we know too less to reconstruct it as a religion.</p>
