<p>I do I have a lot of Irish mixed in with my German, Scottish, and small amounts of Norse all heavy drinking cultures, I said I was stopping before but I really should I just found some old rum left in the house. My uncle will die if he drinks anymore pancreas stuff. My paternal grandmother also drank until her brain cells were fried. Also its possible that I have a native american ancestor somewhere but very unlikely that could be an explanation for my low toleration and addiction  issues. but I doubt it since its on both sides of my family.</p>
