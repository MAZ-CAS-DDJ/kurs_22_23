<p>I have a job in a school but it's on its last legs, I missed work one day, (I have very irregular schedule, I don't know my work hours until 7 am each morning) and I apologized but she hasn't contacted me since.</p>
<p>Do you know what kind of jobs would be easier to get if I do end up with a theft record?</p>
