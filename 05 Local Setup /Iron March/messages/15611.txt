	1.He makes some good points. He is somewhat right that our government is more or less a USA puppet.
</p>

	What i don't like is the fact the he implies we should change our Constitution for a minority(find me a case where magyars are discriminated in our country). He says we should be different from the West, yet he wants us do to something very similar, to have minorities rule over the majority. He may use different words and guile, but he is promoting state destabilization. I think it's hypocritical and i'll present you why. The hungarian population in Romania is a small percent, he says they should be autonomous. Let's say they do that, we'll end up with what? Small nations inside a nation? What about the romanian population in those zones? If they want autonomy also should they also form even smaller nations? You see the problem with this? You just cannot pick and choose what you like, when you like it.

<p>
	Also, i think if any sort of annexation, with force or the vote of parts of Transylvania, will happen, things will get violent again. Right now we have some form of stability. If you want i can get you cases where the hungarians in those zones are way more intolerant of romanians then the other way around.

<p>
	Do any romanians do this kind of thing?

	2. We do, but they are not in the media. You'll find them everywhere, small and divided, people that preach and endorse the traditional ways, from wearing traditional garb(right now, 3/5 girls i see on the street wearsa traditional romanian shirt, it may be trivial but it's something) to advocating traditional orthodox families. <a href="http://www.familiaortodoxa.ro/" rel="external nofollow">http://www.familiaortodoxa.ro/</a>

	You have to understand, almost half a century of communism has a way of crushing your intellectual and spiritual elite. The bolshevik prisons were full with students, priests and scholars. Our very best people, crushed under the red iron boot. We are getting back there again, but the process may be somewhat slow. I believe this is the reason you see an apparent lack greatness and traditionalism from my country.
