<p>I did not mean to make you both angry for declining Black Nationalist's debate duel proposal.</p>
<p>I cannot debate something that I do not believe in though. It is not tenable to debate bias (as opposed to opinion--which I acknowledge).</p>
<p>I was to the illegitimacy of Allah, alluding.</p>
<p>That said, I was (and am still) interested in engaging in a debate concerning Allah and Islam.</p>
<p>But now, I do not want to upset anyone who is easily upset on the Internet, so I am asking if either of you would be offended.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
