<p>I will break it down for you. </p>
<p>You were, for some reason waiting on me to get back to you - I was informing you I would be busy, and that basically if you have any interest whatsoever you need to join the forum that I linked to. If not - fine, if so then i was pointing out there would be a delay as new members have to be activated.</p>
<p>The forum isn't super secret or anything, but the only people who need to be in the loop are those who want to be there. I give my honest opinion on some things that I would put more diplomatically in person. I don't want to make a big think out of any of it to the outside world because I am not like that.</p>
