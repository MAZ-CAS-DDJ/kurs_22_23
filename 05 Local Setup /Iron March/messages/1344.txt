<p>Liberal mainly in terms of people's sexual practices (no tolerance for pedophilia or rape though)</p>
<p>Things such as gays, transgenders, fetishes etc are ok by me and should be held as important.</p>
<p>As long as it is handled responsibly, an not put above the good of the nation, I see it as good "recreation" for loyal and deserving citizens.</p>
<p>Also I do not have any problem with abortion, as long as it doesn't get out of control to where the population decreases signifacantly, as is my opinion with homosexuality.</p>
<p>I am also not a fan of religion either.</p>
<p>I hope that explains the odd liberal side of me well. I also just want to emphasize what I said. Protected by authoritarian force. That means putting down socially unstable individuals.</p>
