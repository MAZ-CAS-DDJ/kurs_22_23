	I listen to alot of TRS but I havent joined simply cus I was unaware they even had an Australian presence until like 2 days ago. And yea man Id say if you can get a good circle of lads to start as the base of the chapter then go for it. Been talking to the president of the Brisbane Chapter tryna organise a meet up, as far as I know Im one of the first people in Brisbane to get involvedÂ
