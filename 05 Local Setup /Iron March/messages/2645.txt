<p>Welcome to the forums... I suppose I'm slightly late, the thread being locked. I think the term you mean is "noocracy", unless you mean specifically technocratic economics. Not exactly my cup of tea(timocracy, curse the Athenians for forever conflating it w/ plutarchy), aside from some economic benefit...</p>
<p>Being a Dane, I suppose you're a bit more familar w/ wodenkindergartens and waldorf schooling than us Americans? Schooling's an area of reform I've been looking into lately.</p>
