	No, Britain is now like any other European country - but I think well, Russians and Germans have the largest most vibrant scene despite having the harshest anti-nationalist laws on the planet, I think that maybe this will be a blessing in disguise.<br /><br />
	All Helm did was repost somebody else's meme which had one of those a jewish identification stars imposed over Luciana Berger, the kind of thing you would post without evn thinking it would become a problem. Helm's mistake was to make fun of a politician, MP's not only have admin powers on Twitter, but their own personal private police force detail who will kick down the doors of anyone who upsets them online. In the case of Joshua Bonehill I saw an MP say that if he didn't retract and apologise for a claim he had made about him (something like him having sex with a dog) and also make a £700 donation to some charity, then "action will begin Thursday", sure enough the police came on that day. In the US it would be a federal crime for a politician to do this. <br /><br />
	It is just that Britain is a playground for any corrupt and pushy cabal, they are allowed to write the law as they go. It is interesting that they never knew or seemed to care about /pol/ or the altright, but anything in their sights, it doesn't matter what the law is, they can do anything. You don't even need to have broken the law, for a year and a half Allison Chablois has been under a constant campaign from the CAA for a very funny song about holocaust survivors. They will be in court again tomorrow and the private prosecution against her will once again ask the judge for 'more time' which he will give them, as if it were arranged. The prosecution are just trying to drain her morale and wealth.
