<p>Idk about the comic, and I'm not in university, I flanked back in september, I need to pay scholarship to go back, so I might enroll again this september, and this would be sort of a break. I saw a Lotgh brook translation blog, and I think I might pick it up to read it, as its the original material.Â </p>
