	For sure... well I'll tell you: I'm in my 30s, and I've been a skinhead since I was 14. What is happening in our country right now is what we've been waiting for for years. People are finally waking up in droves, and we are getting way higher quality people than in the past. Those of us who are already awake need to get together and organize for the future. We don't need to be on the "front lines" necessarily, but build a greater infrastructure for when the time comes. Of course, those of us who are capable will inevitably be on the front lines, but I'm talking about doing stupid shit that doesn't pay off.

	We've got plenty of people in San Diego, from Skinhead groups like Western Hammerskins to Identity Europa, and other stuff in between. I associate with them all. How old are you? You are welcome to come hang out any time.
