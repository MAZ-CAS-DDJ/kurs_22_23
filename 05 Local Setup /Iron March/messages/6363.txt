<p>It does, thanks a lot. The situation in Brazil is hard to compare because we are not a ''real'' nation. No uniform culture and stuff. I have been researching about National-Syndicalism and some systems like Soviet one and also de Yugoslav. We have separatist moviments, but they are economically driven, not really culturally driven. The culture in the south, for instance(that attempted to break free 100 years ago) is different from the north, but yet, is not so far away to be called another culture. That's why I am interested in system that let multiple cultures co-exist without being multicultural.</p>
