	I hear ya, LR is the same shit.  Yea the guys in the group want to push some type of TRS inspired dixie nationalism, they arent really moderates but are stuck thinking about presentation.  I'll try and catch up with you if I'm when down that way.  I've got a friend who needs some work done at his place in Hensley in the next couple months.
