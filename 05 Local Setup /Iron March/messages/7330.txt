<p>Between this and the prior incident with vlad, I no longer have any respect for the adminship or the moderation team. This however was particularly egregious. What should have been a productive thread was turned into a needless gangbang by willful egotists like slavros who can't concede where valid points have been made (and god forbid vlad makes them) and instead go on the attack to protect their non-existent dignity. From what I gather, the reason vlad was banned (by ben!) is because the forum was "embarrassed" (and indeed it is an embarrassment, though not for the reason he thinks it is) in a <a href="https://4chon.net/new/res/3248647.html" rel="external nofollow">thread</a> on 4chon's /new/, which is an absolutely pathetic reason and is the final nail in the coffin regarding any respect I once had for him. I need not even address the flock of indistinguishable vultures and flies who swept into the thread following slavros' lead.</p>
