	In terms of what we do now, it's hiking, training, stickering and general hanging out etc. We operate similar to a fraternity where if anyone needs anything we all help each other out to the best of our abilities. In the near future we'll be doing flash demonstrations and when we've got the numbers and training we'll be doing planned demonstrations. We'll keep on going until this nation has a government that acts in the interests of its people rather than against it.
