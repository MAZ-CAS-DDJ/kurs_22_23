	I apologize if this is not the proper channel to reach you at.

	I discovered you and Slavros on some of the Alt-Right podcasts at TheRightStuff.biz and it brought me here. You have some powerful rhetoric, especially when it comes to the condition of man and that natural order.

	If you're still interested in coming on a guest on other shows, I'd love for you to pay a visit on Christopher Cantwell's YouTube livestream/podcast called Radical Agenda
</p>

<p>
	He's been relatively newly redpilled on race realism and JQ like myself, and I think he could use some direction on where to go next. Most of his listeners are largely NatSocs, White Nationalists, and assorted Alt-Right types. It used to be a libertarian / anarcho capitalist podcast, and still is in many ways.

<p>
	As an expert on fascism, I think you could school him and his listeners on what fascism means and why it's important. He is a Yankee Doodle like myself but means well.
</p>

<p>
	Full disclosure, a year ago he was a fat degenerate and since then he's been working out a lot in the gym and buying tons of guns. He's made a lot of progress, and his most recent podcasts make him look like a skinhead with a shaved head and toned body. However, he does still have a weakness for loose women and it's burned him recently.

	This is an older video but I think it shows that his heart is in the right place. I think some of your wisdom could go a long way
