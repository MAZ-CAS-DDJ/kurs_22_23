<p>I grew up politically involved and sided with the Democratic Party because my parents were. For most of high school I was a socialist because I hated greed, materialism, and inequality. I didnt really have a Marxist attitude toward life, and I question how much I really understood what socialism was. All my life though I believed in duty to God and country, and was always drawn to the monarchical principle and high church Christianity. In college I made a switch to the right as I learned more about ideology, and was repelled at how anti-clerical, anti-monarchical, anti-traditional, and anti-nobility the left all was. I was also entering another primitivist/agrarian spell, and catalyzed my hatred of the myths of progress and industrialization.</p>
<p>Long story short, I'm a crank.</p>
