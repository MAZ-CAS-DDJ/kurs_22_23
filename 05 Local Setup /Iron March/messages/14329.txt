	I have an older sister I don't talk to. Shes a junkie and a thief and was stealing my fathers pain medication and money while he was sick. She also stole my truck, blew up the engine and was trying to break into the families safe with her dipshit boyfriend. Shes supposedly five months clean now in sober living but I don't think I can ever forgive her. What about you? Do you have a better relationship with your siblings? Are you religious?
