	<span style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">Hi Bloender,</span>
</p>

<p style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">
	Thanks for being honest about your affiliation with <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>, and so open to discussion. 
</p>

<p style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">
	I've been intensely researching <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> since my previous reply. Immediately, I was particularly fascinated with, and inspired by, the write ups and videos of the Liverpool confrontation, and the recent demo at Berwick (before seeing your reply on here). I also found the doctrinal and ideological work on <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>'s website, and a <em>Studio 204 </em>interview with Ben Raymond on YouTube, extremely informative and helpful in gaining a more representative understanding of <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>'s ideology and activities. 
</p>

			National Socialism is about the blood AND the soil of our nation, and as such has no hesitation in laying claim to each of these issues as an inseparable part of our greater struggle against Globalism, Capitalism and Materialism in this land.

	This is exactly the kind of deeper ideological direction and communal engagement that I have been seeking. The Leftist monopoly regarding support of poor communities is broad, but extremely shallow - they will gladly sacrifice the safety and wellbeing of the white working class (and those of the middle class who don't conform with their oh-so-enlightened principles), in order to further the narrow and nationally fracturing interests of their favourite pet minority group of the moment.
</p>

<p style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">
	Once the virtue signalling and, more crucially, damage to the cohesion and identity of the nation has been done, Leftists are all too willing to discard these very same minorities and brand them as part of the "oppressors". This enables them to move on to another even more niche group, and cause further damage to our society (take the recent treatment of white, gay males by significant sections of the left, and the increasing focus on "transgenderism" or a whatever the newest term is - hilarious and incredibly ironic in equal measure). (Also, I'm using Left here in the broad sense to denote cultural Marxism, faux-liberals, etc, for ease and simplicity).

			... talk is cheap and Fascists should rightly value action above words ... you'd be concerned about being rejected on the basis of not considering yourself explicitly a National Socialist, but the exact words that you put to your views are less important to us than your willingness to actively stand up for them.

	<span style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">Thank you, and I 100% agree. I stand up and argue the case for my views, both in person and online, at all opportunities (hence my frequent conflict with Leftist organisations and individuals). But I'm not a larper, and know this alone is not enough to affect significant change.</span> I'<span style="font-family:gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;">ve not been engaged in Leftist activism for roughly 7 months, due to conflicts, exclusions, and general personal ambivalence (also finishing off my Masters degree, moving location, getting a job etc). Although I've a long way to go before being accepted a member of <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>, my ideological fervour, personal determination, and several years of practical experience will be greatly useful. </span>

	<font face="gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px;">I definitely have concerns about privacy, but this is something I must take responsibility for myself. My current living space is highly compromised, but it will not affect my activity. I'm just north of London, so think that the London branch would be most suitable for me. Ben Raymond, in the interview noted above, stated that the average age of members is "well under 20" - I'm assuming that being 22 doesn't rule me out or anything?</span></font>
</p>

<p>
	<font face="gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px;">Should I contact <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> through the email on their website to inquire about involvement? I understand there will be several tests to prove both my practical worth and commitment to the cause. I'm happy to answer questions about my previous activism, political engagement, or current personal arrangements on here otherwise. </span></font>
