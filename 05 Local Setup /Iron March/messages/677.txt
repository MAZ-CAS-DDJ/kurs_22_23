<p>Greetings.</p>
<p>Most of the discussion about Belgium here, I've noticed, is done by non-Walloons. As a result, it tends to swing in the direction of Flemish separatism &amp; Greater Netherlands, with no mention of what might happen to Wallonia. What's your opinion on Belgian nationalism and unity versus separation?</p>
