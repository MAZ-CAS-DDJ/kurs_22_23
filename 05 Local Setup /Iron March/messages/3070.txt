<p>There are those as well, but there is a Russian Catholic Church, it's very small(I have one of the 3 or 4 parishes in America in my town) however. But, like you said, most Catholics in Russia are Latvians, Poles, etc... But yes, that's a huge issue with Orthodoxy. They see only Chauvinism, and the Ukrainian Orthodox in Patriach of Moscow are complete traitors to nationalism.</p>
