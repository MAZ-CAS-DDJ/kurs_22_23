<p>You are spot on in the three main views when it comes to scarcity. I agree the NS view of overpopulation from the 3rd world is the most realistic. Not being racially inclined, it tends to not bother me quite as much as others. My main problem with the third world is that most of the people there will amount to little more than peasants and are a general waste of resources. The cost to keep supporting their countries could be used for much greater things.</p>
<p>We are approaching the era of the Luddite. We already see all these "back to the land" types on the left and the "self-sufficiency/survivalist" types on the right. These people basically want to live as caveman. I am a futurist and I encourage progress and advancements in science and technology. It is sad that most people are content to live like apes. It's like Nietzsche said, "what is the ape to man? a laughinstock. as man is a laughingstock to the Ã¼bermensch". We should be pushing ourselves forwards not diving into the past. I'd like to see a new order, a new man, a new society. But alas, that will not be and so I focus on more realistic aims like getting an authoritarian in the White House (which in and of itself is a challenge)</p>
