	I'm nearly full blooded Polish with a smattering of Anglo from my mother's side. I haven't taken a DNA test, but I have no doubt the results would point squarely to Eastern Europe generally. I was raised Catholic although I find myself at odds with their positions more and more lately. The fact that the cardinals in their wisdom decided to elect a communist subhuman as Pope is baffling to me. But yes, I consider myself a Catholic in the Modern Rite, I've never been to a Tridentine Mass.

	How do you guys keep in touch? Both groups, I mean. I have a few fash friends on Cuckbook but it's such a festering cesspool and so heavily anti-White that it's hard to organize anything.

	Also, what are your views on the ethno-state? Most fascists I talk to prefer their own nationalities, but I think a country that allowed any White immigration while denying any lesser races is the most ideal and lasting solution. Unfortunately it doesn't seem as if any country will step up anytime soon.
