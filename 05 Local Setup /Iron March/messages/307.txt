<p>Thanks for responding. I read through the three issues of Reaktion last night, there is some good stuff in there. Like I said in my post in the action thread, I am just kind of tired of how this whole movement seems to be slanted towards Europe and European interests.  I just don't think a lot of the economics, social issues, or politics that fit Europe would ever fly here and I believe some concessions would have to be made for a fascist America. I feel like America could definitely morph into a fascist-like nation without too many issues, although based on Reaktion you seem much more revolutionary than myself.</p>
