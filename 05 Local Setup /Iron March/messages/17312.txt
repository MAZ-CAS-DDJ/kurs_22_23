	"The masses" will be the downfall of the Alt-Right. Most people are too pacifist and if they oppose something, they'll just protest against it or just try to vote against it (which in itself has a 50% chance of failure). There's a reason why IronMarch is Far-Right and not Alt-Right, because Far-Right groups like Golden Dawn, SYDAS, Atomwaffen, National Action (R.I.P.), etc. actually <strong>DO SOMETHING</strong> like beat the shit out of Antifa scum, give food and water to the homeless and sometimes even assassinate traitors. The Alt-Right does nothing other than post memes on the internet. They <strong><em>AREN'T </em></strong>the reason why Trump was elected nor were they the reason for Brexit. They're pointless.
