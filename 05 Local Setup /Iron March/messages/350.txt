<p>thank you for all your posts on this board.  I've been thinking, since that little furry incident the other day, and actually long before that.  They ran him out of town for his fantasies, his projecting what makes him comfortable on his own reality.  I'm glad we are short one furry, but really, looking at this board, i think many of them are guilty of using fascism or whatever brand of third positionism as the same thing.</p>
<p>hell, just go look into that uniform thread, half of them wanted to look like science fiction nazi cyborgs.  i'm becoming slightly disillusioned with the board, i will continue to post because there are some intelligent, down to earth posters here, such as you.  </p>
<p>so, thank you.</p>
<p>sincerely,</p>
<p>ferret.</p>
