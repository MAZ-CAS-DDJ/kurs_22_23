	I'm not worried about the criminality. I am worried because I attend university and will likely get kicked out if I am found as the culprit. Which would mean I've wasted a lot of money and a lot of effort just to have my life ruined over some stupid stickers. <br /><br />
	But I am taking your advice. Will try not to panic.
