	I got shadowbanned and I couldn't delete my old blog so I reported it until they did. I've said a lot on my tumblr that could probably be used against me, but I've got more followers now and they seem to be fine with my anti-((())). YeahÂ Kalash lost all those followers, and now his stuff gets reposted on almost every far right "artist" blog.
