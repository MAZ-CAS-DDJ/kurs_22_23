	Yeah, Amsterdam is a totally degenerate hell-hole. Studied and lived there for a couple of years. Less then half of the inhabitants are ethnic Dutch now, and those that are are usually degenerates or leftist yuppies (who have been moving into the city and driving house prices up for years, driving the original inhabitants out, mostly into surrounding towns like Almere).

	I used to flee the city for a week every year, during the faggot parades, fucking disgusting. I was there a few weeks back on some business, and some 60 year old disgusting old dude came skating by in broad daylight, dressed in nothing but a tight t-shirt and a sparkly gold g-string. That's the kind of stuff you see on regular days, let alone during fucking fag pride.

	Anyway, I'm thinking about doing some sort of flyering or stickering action there sometime in the future. A year ago or something some Muslim had spread some mild anti-faggotry leaflets in one of their neighbourhoods, and the City Council and media were throwing a tantrum for days. Can't wait to see how triggered they'll be if some harsh anti-fag flyers are spread by real Nazi's instead of one their precious Muslims.

	Probably will have to wait for fag pride 2018 for max effect though.
