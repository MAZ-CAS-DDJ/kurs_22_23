<p>We are a non-official separatist moviment that wishes to create an separate republic of the southern states of Brazil ( <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/South_Region_in_Brazil.svg/280px-South_Region_in_Brazil.svg.png" rel="external nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/South_Region_in_Brazil.svg/280px-South_Region_in_Brazil.svg.png</a> would be this area)</p>
<p> We have Social Nationalistic and somewhat fascist ideals, but we try to be open to receive people from different Ideologies. Even tough we are small in numbers, we already have talked with Alexandr Dugin once(not me, but a comrade) and some of us are defenders of Eugenics and stuff(myself included, but we have more ''calm'' people)</p>
<p> We want to separate because the federation ''steals'' our money, and don't respect our culture. We are the second most developed region in the country, we have the Highest HDI of Brazil and the most cultural conservative people. We try to maintain European and ''Gaucho'' traditions, but the brazilians keep trying to destroy it.</p>

<p>Any doubt, please, ask me, your Ideological support is unpriceable! We see Golden Dawn as one of the last hopes of Europe <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
