<p>I actually agree with you about intelligence being separate from creativity. I can't recall it entirely but there is a certain gene that is believed to be linked to creativity that is very low in mongoloids and near enough absent in negroids, but it is common to find it in caucasoids, particularly Northern Europeans (nordics). I see IQ as a good life predictor and measurement of G, but I have a interest in PISA, SATS and TIMSS as they correlate at a great level with 'g' as well and can be accurately converted into IQ scores as Richard Lynn and many others have shown consistently. It's been known since 1903 (or earlier) that the SATS correlates highly with intelligence. Emotional-Intelligence quotient is a good measurement too. IQ is one of the best we've got, however.</p>
<p>I'd probably have to re-read over The Global Bell Curve to see if Lynn comments about the verbal ability of Mongoloids raised in the west. It sounds plausible though. I choose TGBC since that does it for various different countries and has a huge collection of different studies. It really is a fantastic book, it brings back memories of when I first started reading stuff by Arthur Jensen; I can upload it if you're interested, but it will be in jpg form/scanned.</p>
<p>By energy I mean sporting activity. I didn't put blacks at the top because it's a common misconception; they aren't nearly as strong as caucasoids, good at football (soccer) as caucasoids are; nor are they better boxers, although I do have some admiration for Tyson and Muhammed Ali (especially Ali's race separation views) and I do concede that they were good. By no means representative of the whole sport or their race's ability in that sport. I've found a lot of blacks dominate sport in the US mainly for social reasons.</p>
<p>Thanks for the uni advice too. I've been towing the line a lot so far. We're actually starting off with 'The Authoritarian Personality' and Adorno's anti-racist, psychoanalyctic nonsensence and other Frankfurt school rubbish. They start early to feed the agenda in university it seems.</p>
