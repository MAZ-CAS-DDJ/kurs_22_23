	Hey, I'm too much of a newfag to jump in and help hunt errors in the newest IM books (even though I'd love to, but I gotta read the more basic stuff first), but there may be some left in previous ones (including the latest edition of SIEGE). My question is, can I open error reporting threads for those?
