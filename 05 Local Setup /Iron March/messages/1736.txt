<p>Hmm, i suggest we do two ways. First is the democratic form, and at the same time, form a dormant army. Soldiers must be self trained or trained by the local army. In the democratic form, although it is hypocritical, we should use tactics and act like the typical political party. The democratic form must be done first, but if it fails, start forming a dormant army, and if chaos arrives, use the opportunity to take the government.</p>
