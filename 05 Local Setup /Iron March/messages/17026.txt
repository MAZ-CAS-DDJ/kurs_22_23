	I was anti religion for a long time, it played a partÂ to my falling into degeneracy. That being said there is a reason not talking religion was a NSDAP rule. Another reason i dislike TRS, big tent wont work. Christians and Pagans getting along wont happen once the shitskins are gone. Anti religion people already here are fine though they keep it casual and classy in my personal experience
