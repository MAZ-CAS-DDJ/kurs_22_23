	I lived in this small town outside of Wroclaw called Ostrzeszow for a little bit. I was actually born in Sweden (Long story) and I spent a lot of my childhood moving back and forth between Europe and the United States. Gdansk is a very nice city. I visited there 3 years ago and went to Westerplatte and then took a train to Gdynia.

	The people I mainly talk to now is the core of 5 members. 3 from different regions in Poland, and 2 from the US that live in neighbor states to me. The 2 US guys are both out of the Army now. We're actually going on a Fascist camping trip in 2 weeks, so I'll probably post some pictures on here after. The 3 Poles are going into the Straz Graniczna (Border Guards) and they are in the midst of branching out and finding Polish Army members and officers to recruit. Right now our operations only consist of recruitment, psyops, and networking. It will eventually get more physical and regimented once I get leave time in the USMC.
