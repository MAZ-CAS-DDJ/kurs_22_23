<p>Here we have, 2 orthodox saints that were celebrated on this day. 1st Saint Tryohon Zarezan <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryphon_Zarezan" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia....Tryphon_Zarezan</a> - the protector of vineyards, winemakers and brewers in general. Is highly celebrated saint here and main antagonist on Valentine of Rome in some chauvinistic way. And other event is: Assumption of St. Cyril Bulgaro-slavic on ocasion for 1150 anniversary on Moravian mission of St,St Cyril and Methodius...</p>
<p>I lived for about a 6 years with my current girlfriend now, and its pain at the ass sometimes. And some of the main reasons i dislike Valentine of Rome its for nights like this when i must wait trough romantic dinner and walk near the beach flowers and shits to get my present.. But its way better than to be alone...</p>
