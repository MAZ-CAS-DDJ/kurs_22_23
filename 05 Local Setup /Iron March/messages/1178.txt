<p>Fascism to me is not the dark evil thing that people like to portray. For example, I personally have a lot of respect and admiration for the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler. Starting his political party up from nothing then becoming the leader of Germany. But let's face it, the Nazis were genocidal and had to be put down. It was unfortunate that their predjudice got the better of them. Otherwise we would have an even stronger Europe right now. I started to show interest in Fascism in 2006. I read all kinds of books and many things online. And so I formed my own opinions and type of Fascism.</p>
