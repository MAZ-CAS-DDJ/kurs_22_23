<p>Greetings William,</p>
<p>I've noticed that you and I seem to be ideologically similar, and especially in regards to organisation and what needs to be done in the US. So I figured that contacting you would be beneficial. What do you think should be done to organise? A political party? A Political Action Committee? Do share.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Dux</p>
