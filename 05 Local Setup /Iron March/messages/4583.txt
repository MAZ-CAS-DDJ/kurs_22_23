<p>There is a great deal more to it than that, as I try and explain to people. One of the greatest injustices to Fascism is the attempts to reduce its entirety to a set of common political, social, or economic characteristics while ignoring that it is as much, if not more, of a spiritual philosophy as it is a political school of thought, and in doing so the liberals and others have successfully managed to reduce "Fascism" to a smear by which virtually anything anyone disagrees with can be declared to be "Fascist" and therefore discredited. A prime example of the cognitive dissonance facing our modern world.</p>
