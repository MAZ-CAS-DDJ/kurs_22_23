	We foremost need articles on the fascist lifestyle, so outdoorsy stuff, hobby stuff - traveling, adventuring, sports, stuff like mountain climbing, skying, backpacking - these are top priority
</p>

<p>
	secondly we look for cultural articles like reviews of rac/nationalist music or finding particular talent among our own and promoting what they do
</p>

<p>
	anything to do with fascist history that isn't widely known
</p>

<p>
	1488 confessions segment is always open
</p>

<p>
	general worldview and current politics commentary
</p>

<p>
	So long as what you write is at least an a4 page long and adheres to hardline NS/Fascism it has high chances of being accepted.
