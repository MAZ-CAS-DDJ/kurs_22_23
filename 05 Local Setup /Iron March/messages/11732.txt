<p>At this point I don't even care that much where I go to, because if our people do well and succeed in one country,  it's more or less inevitable that we can succeed elsewhere. So I'll help wherever I end up. I did find some things online, but I thought, it'd never hurt to ask actual human beings about it. Just in case of scams or something, you know?</p>

<p>And, again, things have come to the point in which many of us would be willing to fight against "our" countries for the very sake of saving them. Funny how that goes, but it makes sense.</p>
