<p>Only 22 the life is upfront of you dont give up now just try harder. Im 24 this Nov made 25 but i miss my 16-17yo days it was quite fun back then, now the life is boring... Well NBU is a hope for England but i dont have warm feelings about British Empire they backed the Turks when we liberate ourselves.. After that they play major role in preventing uniting all Balkan Bulgarians in one country so i still dont like them and their monarch.. The concept is old and tied with degenerating family of halfwits and retards.. Something new will answer the current problems of englishman and revival of British(ism) is not that thing..</p>
