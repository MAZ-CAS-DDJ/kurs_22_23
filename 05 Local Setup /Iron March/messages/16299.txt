	Hello, it seems as you're Romanian according to your flag, I wanted to ask you something about gypsies and Romanians.
</p>

<p>
	The image that I have on my brain about a gypsy is this:
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="el-cigala.jpg" class="ipsImage" src="http://www.kavolta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/el-cigala.jpg" /></p>

<p>
	Is this one a "gypsy" or did these folks from India stole the definition of gypsy? 
</p>

<p>
	Im asking it because some stupid Europeans confuse Romanian with the guy of the photo, the guy of the photo is an Indian invader, but I want to know if they are really gypsies or gypsy is a Romanian culture, of white people
