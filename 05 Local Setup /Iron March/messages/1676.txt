<p>"Rus was a landscape and moscow was a part of it. Later it decomposed in several states." The landscape has many regions and the Russia dont begin as a unified state there are many principalities like Novgorod, Ryzan etc...  I always think the Rus came from Swedish viking tribe ROS..  Like Svendislau the duke of Kiev.</p>
<p>"The idea of third rome came with the orthodox religion, not with the wedding. (The wedding is just a kind of excuse) Constantinople was the true last rome." No its not it came for last Byzantine empress. Just like the two headed eagle who was family coat of arms for Paleologos family.</p>
<p>"But the idea of the third rome can be used to boost the cultural strengt. Even its old. Time will tell." Can boost only counties who have links with Rome in their history. It will not boost anything in Iraq for example.</p>
<p>"???What? I know that its St.Georg, I was talking about slavic myths and paganism...." Well you know that there is no "slavic" people? The slavics are mentioned in 1559 by a Croat historian Stephen Srakul and later the idea of "slavic" brotherhood and so.... Later the idea of panslavic union was embraced by Ekaterina "The Grat" and Peter Ist by mean of lay Russian influence in eastern Europa states. In first versian of Panslavic bullshits there are included all Orthodox nations + (Albanians and Hungarians) after the bad reception by Albanians,Hungarians and Greek they was droped as 'Slavic" nations. So you will talk about Finns-Ugrians mythology of god Perun, Lada , Volos and so on... But a chinese dragon ??? Is that also part of the game story ?</p>
<p>"Its black-gold-white with the two-headed eagle and the blazon of moscow. You should know it. (The flag of the russian empire and the romanov dynasty.)" Thanks for the info i just dont understand you correctly. But after reading this:
