<p>Honestly I don't think that's healthy to just ignore a part of yourself just accept who you are you can't change that shit man, when I was a kid I always wanted black hair and black eyes like asians I wanted to live in a homogenous culture too where everyone looked the same that to me looked like a real country a real family. You should just accept that your an enlightened germanic mestizo istead of an iberian mestizo.</p>
