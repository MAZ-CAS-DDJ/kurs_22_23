<p>Hey, so a few months in and I have taken your advice. I've got a handful of good like minded men in the area who I am in decent communication with. We have plans to develop something in the U.S that we think has a shot at spreading. Though I won't go into details about that without consent from them. Does that conflict with what Atomwaffen does? I'm actually sort of unclear as to what Atomwaffen is specifically. But a few of the lads have been brought over to Ironmarch so I figured I would at least mention something to you beyond what I vaguely talked about in my intro.  </p>
