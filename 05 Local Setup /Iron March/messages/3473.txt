<p>I noticed your Buckley quote and wanted to know your opinion of him?  I've been really getting into quite a few post-WWII conservatives like him, Revilo P. Oliver, Robert Welch, Sen. McCarthy, etc. Basically anyone who wanted to rid America of the communist trash that was coming in and ruining our values. I honestly think I am just an old school conservative but in this day, we need the strong arm of something a bit extreme to clean up this country</p>
<p>I'm also far more pro-market than before, if you'd enjoy discussing that. I see not much has changed here and it looks like it's still run by a bunch of kids with these lofty, pie in the sky ideals.</p>

<p>Buckley was a good man, just a little too soft on the Lefties for my likes. His writings on Conservative Philosophy continues to be a national treasure as far as I'm concerned though. You have a good reading list there, you should just expand it a bit to include some Mises and Friedman because even though they were kikes, they had the right idea on Economics and Politics. I'm glad to see you have become smarter on Economics and see the virutes in the market. This place deifnitely still is run and controlled by a whole mess of NaziBolshi types, but I'm hoping my upcoming large donation to this place will give me a little more say over how things are run around here.</p>
