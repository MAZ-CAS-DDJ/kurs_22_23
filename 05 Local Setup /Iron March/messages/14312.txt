	I haven't really ever thought about that, but you're right. I remember there was actually this homeless aid foundation that came to our school because, as it turned out, we had a significant number of homeless students. After they were done with their presentation they invited anyone who was homeless (and female, their focus was on single mothers) to get an information packet or something. There was one Filipino girl, but the rest were white. The latino girls all went out to the parking lot and got in their boyfriend's ricers, all the black girls went out to the parking lot and rode off in their boyfriend's Escalades.
