	Yeah I read it thoroughly along with every post in both chatlogs. We have the same discussion every other week and you're not bringing any new arguments to the table - which is fine, I would have just merged it with another thread probably but the whole point of your post was to attack AW as you know have a large amount of their people on our forums so in the interest of being drama free I locked it.

	Guess what fam, the mainstream interpretation of Christianity is that it is anti-racist and egalitarian as well, but we can argue against that easily, and we can use the same arguments to argue against the "anti-racism' of the Quran - but we don't even need the Bible or the Quran to understand that God made different nations and gave them different abilities so its largely irrelevant what either the Quran or the Bible say about it.

			I specifically "targeted" AtomWaffen because they are the only group that I know of that has any Muslims at all. I fail to see any one else every talking about this issue either. Muslims can't be Fascists plan and simple, read my post again specifically the part in which I quote their holy book

	 The Bible says the same thing  - "There is no difference between Jew or Greek" [EXCEPT IN THEIR PIETY] - which is exactly what what the verses that you quoted were saying. Therefore, if you are against Islam on the grounds of a few surface level "anti-racist" quotes then you are against Christianity on the same grounds. If you are against Islam on the grounds that it's not "European" because Europeans historically haven't believed in it, you're also against Esoteric Hitlerism on the same grounds and you're going to have to claim all those guys can't be NS. It's completely arbitrary based on your own perspective. You are not being objective about the religion so you can't possibly know the truth about it. Have you even bothered to read the Quran? Your problem is with a religion that is almost identical to Christianity; I bet you don't care about Paganism or EH so that tells me you don't care about the actual truth (monotheism) but rather, how "white" something is. Just because white people believe in in doesn't make it true. If only Arabs believed in a round Earth and we all believed in a flat Earth, the truth would still be that the Earth is round. Islam is not a perfect religion just like Christianity is not a perfect religion, but it holds MANY, MANY universal truths and can help us come to a more complete understanding of reality, much like Christianity, Buddhism, Paganism, etc - therefore, it is completely fine for an NS person to be a muslim.
