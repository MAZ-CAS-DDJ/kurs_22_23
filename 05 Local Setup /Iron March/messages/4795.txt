<p>We are trying to form an official moviment, but since our members live in different town, we are having difficulties to do that. I have some comrades here, but still it's far from any powerful moviment. There are Groups like ''Sul Ã© meu Pais'' (South is my Country) but they are liberal and weak.</p>
<p>Also, I already sent your blog to my friends, I liked it, they still didn't aswered me.</p>
<p>Do you have any moviment too?</p>
<p>Edit: Sorry for my bad english</p>
