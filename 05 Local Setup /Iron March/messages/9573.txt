<p>You will be the greatest mother. I just noticed your curly hair again, you look so Italian, so beautiful  <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wub.png" alt=":wub:" /></p>

<p>I do like to surround myself in the symbolism of death (books of war, murder, lots of totenkopf etc) but the reality of death, at least the degenerative kind, is not so pretty. I feel so terribly for your father, I know that feeling of hopelessness and dependency. Although not life threatening, I had lyme disease for 3 years, and that definitely shaped my character. I will talk about it another time but as a result of that I would rather shoot myself than be physically dependent again.</p>

<p>What an excellent song.</p>
