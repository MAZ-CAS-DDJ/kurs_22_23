	Even if we get some groups that integrate well with whites, like Cubans, Jamaicans &amp; some East Asians, they may not have the same integration problems (IQ, economic, crime, &amp; social cohesion) we still get the issues of identity, which forms different socio-economic and political stances in the struggle for scarce resources by exercising will to power, but also genetic and cultural assimilation which harms the ability of whites to uphold their own society, and intangible things like cultural and religious values, even if that is just a state of mind it has physical manifestations which influence the world around us and create that connection between past and future generations that shapes our identity and guides our destiny. There isn't any replacement for these things, the attempt to make individuals individualistic &amp; internationalist, the marxists, liberals &amp; fake right-wing (conservatives/libertarians) mistakenly bring groups into the nation that clearly abuse our trust and willingness to engage and accept differences for the better of all societies, which comes mainly at our own disadvantage. In some ways permanently.
