<p>Quick point before I even start: You'll probably want to add a small intro or preamble which explains to people that this will be a series of articles, their subject in total and if you have a plan of what articles will come out in what succession a small rundown of them, so that people know its a series even if I'll make a poster for it which will say part 1. Speaking of which i'll need you to send me example images with names/titles so i know what to look for when i'll be making the poster for this. I'll get to reading it now.</p>
