	You don't see how your thread would devolve into shit flinging? It's literally "why we hate Atomwaffen, signed AU". The entire post was clearly meant to be inflammatory and I'm not going to unlock it, actually you're lucky I saw it first - if it was anyone else you would have gotten a warning and a timeout in the corner. Conclusion was already reached numerous times, you can't base your opinion of Islam on CNN and facebook counterjihad memes. It's perfectly possible to be NS and Muslim, or NS and EH, NS and Christian, NS and Buddhist. Every argument you can make against Islam you can also make against other religions that are generally accepted amongst NS people, you guys have some weird hangup because lots of brown people believe in it, not the actual substance of the religion.
