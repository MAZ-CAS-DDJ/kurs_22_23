<p>I am quite pessimistic myself, but I am a Choleric. I feel the need to encourage those around me.</p>
<p>Take a military leader for example, even though he knows that a battle will be brutal and there will be a lot of bloodshed, he will try to motivate the soldiers with a speech. Why? It gives them courage and hope.</p>
<p>It is not good to be a pessimist, nor an optimist. It is the best to be a realist. See the world as it is: grey. When you see it black, you will become a fatalist. When you see it as white, you will be led by hopes instead of facts.</p>
