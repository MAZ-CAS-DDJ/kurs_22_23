<p>Nothing, currency today is quite stable and there is literally <em>nothing</em> backing it up except humanity's belief in its value. Money gets its value not from anything that's backing it, but the belief and usage of it as an exchange for services and products. Using gold to back a currency doesn't really change much. Also, Strasser's works were produced at a time when information wasn't as freely accessible as it is today--thus the obvious misunderstandings he had especially from areas of limited information or areas where he was not allowed into. (Hitlerite Germany, Soviet Union for example). </p>
