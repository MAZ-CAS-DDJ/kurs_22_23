	Its better than going in person in my opinion I don't have to have a wacky schedule of every other day with classes just lectures and due dates all my work is whenever I want to do it. glad I left my shitty old University that I stayed at for a year and a semester full of degenerate niggers and STDs it was a moonman song come to life.
