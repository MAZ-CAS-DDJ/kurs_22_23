<p>I can only concur. England's miseries are, at least in part, a product of a deeply rooted social conformity that stems from an attenuated conception of morality. The 'Rights' discourse has always been understood as being conservative in one form or another, there's a tendency to raise one's eyebrows at the mentioning of ideologies and doctrines. They're criticised for being "Inorganic". The fact of the matter is Modernity happened, changed the rules of the game and left conservative formulations in the dust. </p>

<p>It's tragic to reject the idea that one can simply turn back the clock, but to deny this classicism is to be a romanticist. Even attempts to revitalise fascism are, in my opinion, in vain. Fascism to me was the result of an unorthodox union between veterans of the Great War and elements of the Proletariat; a project of a particular generation within a particular epoch. </p>

<p>Through metapolitics one takes a step back and experiences an eagle's vision of the present situation. But we need concrete theory, we need a return to ideas. </p>
