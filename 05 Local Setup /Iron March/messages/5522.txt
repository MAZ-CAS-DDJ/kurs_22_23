<p>I agree that 24 hrs ago, some of the NBU fb page posts did not have the appropriate essence to them but put this down to a "bad day" on the part of whomsoever.  Then the warning post...then the rest of it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I think that there was initially a battle over control of the page and a NBU member with legit. access made the warning post.  I agree, other possibilities exist for that post, such as luring people, such as I, and you, to the page in an effort to capture our ISPs (our computer address &amp; information).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are 2 ways basically to take control of a page:</p>
<p>- internal / traitor; or</p>
<p>- a target hack.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If it is a traitor, it has to be someone with whom access information to those pages (NBU, Blackshirts) was shared and goes back to your point of Gary placing trust in some flawed individual(s).  My overly speculative mind - I admit it - asks when did the earlier website and now the fb page issues occur?  It seems to have been over the past 3 weeks.  What else, I ask, has taken place over that time frame? The obvious answer is, if I am correct, are the changes in the English Defence League (EDL) and Sam Westall joining the NBU and rocketing up the hierarchy. Sam, judging between the lines of some of the Gary / NBU posts, brought with him some EDL members.  Sam has been active and particularly in growing the presence in social media with British area fb pages. Maybe a "former" EDL member who was brought in by Sam and given, quite innocently, fb access information and the damage caused that way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is a further, far more nefarious, possibility that I feel cannot be ruled out: Sam Westall wants Gary's position. This could all be, IF -note the stress- this is true, a ruse to execute that internal coup d'etat. As I mentioned nearly a week ago, I reached out to Sam Westall via a fb message.  I made an initial contact around 1.30 am one morning, my time. The following morning, a few hours later, the message was missing from my message folder.  I thought it odd.  I heard nothing.  Thinking that perhaps I had not actually sent the original message due to an error on my part, I sent another, on Monday.  Again, with hours, that message was deleted, clearly by him.  Was he just automatically deleting all messages in his "Other Messages" fb folder as a matter of course without reading them?  Maybe.  I just feel that after all his posts about reaching out to him, such action is not appropriate.  Incidentally, Sam Westall, made an application to join the ABL Closed group page around midnight UK time Tues/Wed and I accepted his request - 7 (!) members of that group now - but I see he has not looked at the page.  IF anything untoward occurs in ABL closed group, it, right now, would almost certainly place the blame upon Sam Westall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Personally, all of these social media incidents smell more like a hack to me but, in my opinion, the above cannot be ruled completely out. </p>
