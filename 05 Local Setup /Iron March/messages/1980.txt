<p>So I have a thought. Some of my friends where talking about the farm murders and how they are one of the most prominent symptoms of the modern insanity. What we discussed was having a type of Abe Lincoln brigade <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln_Brigade" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln_Brigade</a> which would gather funds in America and Europe from nationalist groups and send defensive militias to help the farmers. As someone who actually lives in South Africa, is this a good idea? Would the native Afrikaners go for it?</p>
