	Hey, I've been meaning to ask you a question in regards to something you said some time ago (I think it was on the Thulean Perspective thread) about how you considered "The Next Leap" to be a mistake for IronMarch. Could you explain more about why you think that? I'm curious to hear.

	In other news, hope life has been going well!Â
