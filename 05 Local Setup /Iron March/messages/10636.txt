<p>Yeah, I'd found some Chinese manufacturers and ebay sellers before, i don't want them made in China and the eBay sellers are quite pricey (50-60 pound for 50 stickers. I've thought about asking tightrope records as they sell like 50 stickers for 2 bucks so obviously there are cheaper alternatives, ones that may not be online. When the time comes that you find a decent manufacturer, let us know how much and if it's no hassle to throw my lot in with yours, that would be much appreciated. I had some IM flags made up, for your trouble il send you one.</p>
<p>Cheers </p>
