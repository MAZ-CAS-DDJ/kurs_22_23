	Likewise. While, I doubt we will agree on every point, its imperative that fascist groups not only communicate, but work together whenever possible. Its a fairly common criticism fromnour brothers and sisters overseas (as I'm sure you're aware) that Americans cannot keep a fascist movement going. One thing thatni personally think most don't understand, is the shear size of this country, and its effect on logistics within a movement. In would argue that we hactually do have a strong fascist movement because most of the fascists I knew 10 years ago are still fascist its the associations that keep changing, not number of people within the overall "movement". When you have a country as spread out as this, you are going to have movements organized in cells first, then small groups, then those groups begin to act in coordination with each other. By the time that happens, it all of then sudden turns out we had a larger movement than many other countries all along, which turned out to be WHY we appeared so disorganized.

	I look at it like this, if I refuse to work and communicate with other groups, unless I can successfully claim that they are in fact, not fascist, then my refusal makes me an antifascist.

	We can worry about what to do with other ethnicities once we have actually accomplished something. I'm just stating our current platform!.
