<p>As for Centurion Method as I've said before, I privately harbored my political and religious beliefs and as CM grew did my best to keep them out of it (I believe philosophical propaganda is better if it is apolitical), but as time went on and the antifa cunts got more and more twattish about everything I eventually snapped and began to express the Identity and European elements more visibly. The most recent edition of the book contains our most obviously Fascist material being a compilation of all the self overcoming booklets that followed the CM manual itself and the appendix even has a very un-subtle reference to a supposed death ritual performed by the SS at Wewelsburg. </p>

<p>As time goes on my wife and I are becoming less and less concerned with what the outsiders think and becoming more insular. My wife will be active on here at some point and she is right now in that pure rage phase of understanding Fascism where you see enemies of the folk everywhere and are just boiling with hatred for everything and everyone.</p>

<p>I'm also trying to contact the guys who run NA in the UK (no response via their normal email, obviously been spammed to shit in the last few days) as obviously CM and what we do would be a perfect opportunity to train with them and if not get them super fit or interested in fitness at least get them a bit more aware of the way they can utilise the violence they face when doing demo's etc. I ran a course last year briefly in an abandoned military base and got everyone in masks and weight vests and made them move through the base doing a series of exercises and then finished with a brutal workout and whilst they did it I barked and kicked them and shouted at them for being scum. I planned far more extreme actions, a friend of mine has paintball and airsoft stuff and we put together an idea of a full boxing and weapon spree mid workout to get people used to violence and exertion. When White Rex come over I think we're going to discuss the possibility of doing such exercises with civvies in various European countries.</p>
