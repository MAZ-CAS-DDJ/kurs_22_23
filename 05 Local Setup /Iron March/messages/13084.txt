	I am 16, and the past couple of years I really didn't have a good understanding of a lot of things and until last year I was taking in liberal ideas and I didn't realize it until my brother started giving me information about fascism and then for the rest of the year I started questioning what I was thinking and now I know fascism is good and now I have a good idea of what need to be done. I hope to learn a lot more about it here.
