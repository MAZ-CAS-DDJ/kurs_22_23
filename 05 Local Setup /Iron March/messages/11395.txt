<p>You're family sounds cooler than mine. My dad's side is pretty much extinct, and my mom's family are just white-washed and stupid spics. Except for my grandparents, they're sweet.</p>

<p>muh bro is a fully-bred spic. He's pretty "white", though. Doesn't speak Spanish, likes baseball, is a good person.</p>

<p>All the fun stories of college shenanigans makes me wish I could trigger faggots. Aren't any in the vicinity, though. Just republitards.</p>

<p>I said I supported Texas secession, which I do, but it's never going to happen. There's just no precedent, people here are just burgers like the rest of them. Any pride they have in this state is just superficial shit like "I like Texas because the Cowboys!" or "The Texas state fair is really fun!". The spirit of the settlers has passed.</p>

<p>Do you ever make fun of your dad for listening to Alex Jewnes?</p>
