			Also, I think it may be possible that humans can serve as unknowing vessels for the Gods. I think Hitler may have been the incarnation of the force/archetype that we call Odin/Wotan - if you look at my profile picture, its a painting of Odin partaking in the Wild Hunt - and who does Odin look like? Hitler! This was painted before Hitler was even born; it's almost like the artist unconsciously "predicated" Hitler's arrival. I'm not saying this is all inerrant "proof" of something, but it just makes ya think, y'know?

		Classical (especially baroque) and power/neoclassical metal here, but I've been getting more and more into black metal lately. The problem is a lot of it is really crude and repetitive. I prefer stuff like Burzum, which doesn't lack creativity.<br /><br />
		Traditionalist Catholics seem okay, I have a few friends among them and distributism aligns well with fascist social/economic values. It looks to me like Protestantism in America's totally gone off the deep end, like either you have a gay woman priest or you believe Jesus made the dinosaur bones to test us. Anglicanism is only stable in Africa, and there it's just taking in native conservatism.

		I totally agree that there's a soul beyond the material, and that pagan deities are examples of healthy ancestral values. Also that Jungian understanding isn't far removed from an actual pagan one, Rodnovers at least usually see the deities as different manifestations of a supreme All-Father.<br /><br />
		Interesting stuff on the Hitler theory. ;)
