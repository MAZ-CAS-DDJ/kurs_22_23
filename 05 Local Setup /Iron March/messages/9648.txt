<p>I'll get down to Our Lady of Fatima's Chapel when I can. I'll be going to the one on the university campus more often, I hope to find some good Catholic friends.</p>
<p>I've visited that campus before. It's a Catholic school but most of the people there are pro-gay. I intend to bring down a reign of terror. There are two other fascists I know going down there too. Should be amazing...</p>
