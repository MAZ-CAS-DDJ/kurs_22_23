<p>Day 1  - Normal shit, MMA, cooking, etc. prepare everything for three days.<br><br>On day 2 poison everyone in the camp with psychadellics and play Hitler speeches and vapourwave through hidden speakers, this is all part of phase 1. Everyone will be really freaked out, but they will thank you later, don't worry about people running off because they won't get far. put them round a swastika, once calm brainwash the attendees into a state of egodeath and euphoria - allow them to meet Hilter and to realise their true selves, this will allow them to re-enter the world as forth reich fighting men, totally assured of their authenticity.</p>

<p>Day 3 - nobody will feel like doing much. They will be slumped like bees, read to them - I really recommend forever and ever by Savitri Devi</p>

<p>That is another good point. it is public now and that is how the media will refer to it in future. it is also kind of safe because the Sigurd programme can't be interpreted as clandistine, it is purely social if that makes sense - it can't me mistaken for a militia or whatever.</p>
