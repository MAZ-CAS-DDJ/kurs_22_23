<p>I'm still working on it. My unit's in an "up-cycle" so I'm in the field more often than not and when I'm not in the field I'm more often drunk than sober. I have several running drafts covering several topics. I want to write a piece on every major issue then combine them afterwards.</p>
<p>If you want to collaborate with ideas let me know, I'd love to work with a fellow American for a change. I go back out in April so I'll try to make this month productive. Hit me up on Skype at dmarulanda3.</p>
