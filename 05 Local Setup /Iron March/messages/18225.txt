	Hello comrade!

<p>
	1. Opinions on Hitler and NS differ among Polish nationalists. Some openly hate NS and Hitler due to history and they also argue that NS was materialistic/atheist, while Polish national-radicalism was more based on spiritual principles, much like Codreanu's Legion of the Archangel Michael. Some other consider Third Reich to be an inspiraton, but they are not open about it.

	2. Polish National Socialist movement is divided and not very strong. There was a Blood &amp; Honour branch in Poland, but due to internal divisions and police crackdowns it became unactive. There are 4 B&amp;H factions in Poland, where first is basically a one guy running the website, second is focused on organizing RAC concerts, third one consists of younger members but they are not very active and the last one which is allegedly made of police informants. A lot of ultras are NS, but the usage of swasika is limited. There is also a different form of NS growing in Poland, which is Strasserist in nature. These are mostly Autonomous Nationalists that use the Black Front flag and are inspired by Otto Strasser.

	3. Opinions on Azov and Ukraine are very divided. Some Polish nationalists support Azov, while others hate Ukraine due to massacres on Polish people commited by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia_and_Eastern_Galicia" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia_and_Eastern_Galicia</a> . Ukrainian nationalism has been always more or less anti-Polish in its nature, so the conflict still exist and will exist. There is also a problem of huge Ukrainian immigration to Poland where native workers are replaced by the cheap-labourers from the Ukraine. Personally, I think that Ukraine is slowly becoming a failed state with corrupt government (especially oligarch Poroshenko), so they are not a good material for an ally.
