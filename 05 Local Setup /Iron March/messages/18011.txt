	Hey SecondEstate,
</p>

<p>
	Welcome to the forum first and foremost. Let me give you some advice: these guys aren't really interested in a conversation that extends beyond their own defined concepts. I tried to critique some of their ideas in my own intro post and they didn't do anything but shitpost.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend just "playing along" for now and then engage them in other threads.Â 
</p>

<p>
	Let me know if I can help you with any reading materials. They already posted the large volume of intro materials but if you are looking for anything in particular I might be able to help.
</p>

<p>
	Cheers.
