	Drugs are gone besides the weed. Because of the weed, which is non-addictive, I have been able to quit smoking and I am going to stop once I run out of the shit. Waste not want not. I got into some worse shit over the last two weeks and got off it. I've lost my faith, and that's not going to be coming back, I've lost a lot of myself really. For now I'm focused on physical betterment, I've started really getting into shape again, really training hard, and just getting out more, doing better things with my time then sitting around, either ranting on this website or another one, and testing the waters on some things to see if I actually do want to do them or not. <br /><br />
	Fascism provided me a cause, but it was the sense of grouped brotherhood that kept me going. I've lost that, especially with IronMarch, especially because of Atomwaffen and the muslim shit, especially because this site and organization got fucked up over the last year. Despite what Slavros says this is an organization of people, what we have achieved thus far is what matters. And in the long term, we've pretty much created a Fascist's Bible, or at least a Fascist's Proverbs/Psalms and Gospel. But as for actions, stories, and overall results, we haven't achieved much. Whether that's going to change starting with guys like Odin, I, or Noyles now, whether it's going to start when WW3 hits, whether it's going to start when the race riots get bad enough and we get more and more national edgelord autistic fuckups coming here and bettering themselves by becoming reasoned and objective fascists, is unknown to me. I can try and start a fire, which I've done, especially in the last week alone, but if it doesn't catch it's not going to burn. So I suppose an explosion needs to be triggered. And I think I have the means to do that. <br /><br />
	There are things in my head that I want to desperately justify with what I know about Slavros and that's the worst thing in my head right now, the fact that I'm willing to deflect on someone else instead of bettering myself and becoming a better example. I'm incapable of doing that right now. <br /><br />
	Fascism found me and it gave me a reason to live and keep going during something really fucking hard. It's possible that I simply switched my priority to something else that wasn't sustainable. This is, it's something I can die for that's probably  not going to fuck itself over in the future, like a wife, family, potential children, friends, or anything that exists on a physical level.<br /><br />
	Fascism is an ideal. It's the best ideal as far as we know and we intend to get it out there. Until of course one of us transcends and joins the space-lizards, or rather kills the space-lizards and taking over, this is what we're doing. I'm probably one of the most faithless and least enthusiastic people about it now, but I'm going to take what is left of it with me because it's the one thing that isn't going to abandon me and thus it's the one thing I'm not going to abandon.<br /><br />
