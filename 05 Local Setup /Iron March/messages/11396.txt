<p>All the time I laugh at him and we talk about conspiracy theories , eh my family is alright were not without our problems no family is , mine is just a little better than some peoples I've seen.</p>
<p>My one friend has three step siblings one with his dad's and two with his mom's family  they're all rednecks so its funny. he stopped talking to me after highschool he has anxiety problems and he just works in his little job at a truck part factory with his stepdad. My other friend has some Jewish ancestry which we made fun of him for all the time and his nose, his dad just got him a job driving forklift at his warehouse.</p>

<p>Me my parents said I had to go to college or get a job , so the choice was obvious I didn't want to work and it's easy to bullshit some papers at college.</p>

<p>I was in ROTC in highschool for two years and I briefly considered joining the military before I learned how shill they were. Also they would force me to get my wisdom teeth removed and that's bullshit I have my upper ones and I chew with them and my lower ones remain in my gums I have a phobia of surgery and doctors, but the funny thing is I'm okay with blood and guts and pain in a war setting not in a medical sense.</p>
