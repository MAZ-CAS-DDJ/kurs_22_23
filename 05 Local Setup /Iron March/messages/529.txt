<p>My mother is 1/2 Afrikaans and 1/2 English. My father is Afrikaans. Sadly my parent got divorced when I was about 6 and my father was only around on weekends and late at night when they were married. I was raised to be more English. Sadly my Afrikaans is not that great. I am a South African White Nationalist that and I have a disdain for the British, but I support British proper NS.  My dream is for White South Africans to unite in order to establish a Volkstaat that will be about 80% Afrikaaner and will put Afrikaaner culture above that of the English. At heart I am more of an Afrikaaner then an Englishman.</p>
