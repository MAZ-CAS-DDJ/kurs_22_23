<p>Seeing you're a former geneticist i would like to ask something concerning Watson (the gene pioneer). Is it there any truth on the claim that he somehow throughout his studies, has shown there is a "Hupple Effect" in human genome, where it is shown that Whites tend to distance themselves genetically from the other races, which led to his ostracization from the scientific community? I heard this claim from someone of NS ideas (a really respectable and knowledgeable person - so i wouldn't dismiss him real easily) but i couldn't find any info on the matter or his genuine reports. thanks</p>
