<p>Hehe, people have been asking the same thing as you recently....</p>
<p> </p>
<p>About agrippa's book about women: first, it's basically a joke. He wrote it as a gift to a noble woman who was his sponsor, but the true message of the book is reflected in his later book (on the uncertainty and vanity of the arts and sciences), in which he condemns the church and intellectuals, especially scholastics, and says that all their arguments based on scriptures are vain because you can quote scripture to prove even a silly point. This is something he did ironically in his book on the superiority of women - he compiled biblical quotes and used sophistry to prove a point everyone knew at that time to be false (this is in the 1500's, not the 1960's).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Is Agrippa a good source? Yeah. But either way, his three books of occult philosophy are mostly a compilation of hundreds of other books from many different authors, so their value is far beyond what his personal value as an author is. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'll give you the same recommendation I gave the other ironmarch members who asked about this:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>

<p><span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">As a starting point, read </span><a href="http://laraj.ca/files/Frawley%20-%20Real%20astrology.pdf" title="External link" rel="external nofollow">Real Astrology</a><span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"> by john frawley, because it's entertaining and informative. It also ends with a good bibliography with notes to get you started on astrological knowledge. Since astrological symbolism is fundamental to all other branches of legitimate esotericism (alchemy, magic, traditional medecine, whatever), it's good to have some basic grounding, but Frawley goes beyond that and really drives home the difference between the traditional world view and the modern world view. Once you're done, you can read </span><a href="http://laraj.ca/files/ChristianAstrology-I.doc" title="External link" rel="external nofollow">Christian Astrology</a><span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"> to get a detailed knowledge of what frawley only alludes to.</span></p>
<p style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"> </p>
<p style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Once you're ready to branch out, I can only recommend Agrippa's three books of occult philosophy. It's a summary and synthesis of over 200 ancient and medieval books on every subject related to esotericism. <a href="http://laraj.ca/files/1%20v3.pdf" title="External link" rel="external nofollow">Here</a> is my cleaned up version of the first book out of three. I recommend you buy the Donald tyson annotated version once you get the dough and the inclination.</p>

<p>Oh, and as an addendum, it's wrong to say that magic was considered a sin in christianity or the church. There were many exceptions and fine distinctions made on this subject. For example, anything which could be considered "natural magic" was considered ok by the church, since this is the main way doctors and wisewomen performed medecine. Astrology was also considered OK by the church, so astrological magic was also accepted. You can learn more about all of this from agrippa.</p>
