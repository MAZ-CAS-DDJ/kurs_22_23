	Damn gets stressful too seeing the same things repeated over and over again. I care about terrorism and my race but am becoming desensitized to rape etc and I don't like that. I am ok and perfectly fine reading that stuff expecially if I do not know it.

	But if I do know it and it is not new, its a waste of time reading about the rapes, murder and punder. I'd rather use that time learning self defense or thinking of home made armor or weapons I can possibly build, or building a community.
