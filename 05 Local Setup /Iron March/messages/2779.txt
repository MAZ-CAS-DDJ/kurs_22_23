<p>Well I do appreciate the enlightenment. Oh, and I realize that I made an extremely arrogant statement by stating that I knew how the world worked, but I realize that nobody is going to believe me on that subject.</p>
<p>Oh and I do understand my own culture. In fact, I come from a completely white bloodline stemming from originally Wales, but my ancestors have been in the US since before the revolution. However, in my observations, I have come to realize that in today's world, it is an archaic and outdated reactionary belief that ethnic cultures should be separated and at war with each other. Your side feels threatened by the increasing amount of minorities, correct? Well I do hope you realize that there is no need to be worried about that because of current United Nations measures to undergo mass population reduction, mainly among minorities. One example is the release of AIDS and Smallpox on Africa via World Health Organization vaccines carrying the diseases.</p>
<p>What the world elite are planning will hurt fascists just as much as communists. Yet fascists still insist on separating the human race into warring factions. It is like if individual cells in the body attacked each other because of the differences between white and red blood cells. When they do that, the body they inhabit will die, bringing them down as well.</p>
