<p>Slovenia was relatively successful in the 90s, but is now in economic crisis. Still, we're doing better than other ex-Yugo countries but Yugoslavia really ruined us. Before 1918 we were equally developed as Austria, but today Austria is obviously much much better economically.</p>

<p>A lot of Slovenians in the west of the country can speak Italian, that's because they're close to the border and were historically culturally close to northern Italians in Friuli, Venezia... In the capital Ljubljana this isn't the case. In the east of the country a lot of people speak German very good though.</p>

<p>I speak Slovene, English, Serbian/Croatian, German and I learnt Latin for many years. I can't "speak" it though, never tried it because you don't usually learn Latin to speak it. I can speak some basic Spanish and Italian, I'm planning to improve on those two languages.</p>
