<p>Well personally I'm a really social guy, I'm like one of the most social persons in my crew, whenever there was some meeting where we had to make a good impression on some random people, they used to send me first. That's just how I am, I never understood these modern liberal pussies who're always shy, I mean why the fuck should you care about what random people think about you even if you make an idiot out of yourself. I don't know how people you meet through internet are but one thing I learnt in my life is to never trust the first impression. I'd give pretty much everyone from a forum like IM a chance in real life even though many of them would most likely turn out to be some sort of autists, but then again you never know.</p>

<p>A week ago me and some guys from my crew had a really bad experience with some guy whom we trusted a lot because he seemed like a really good guy at first, I won't really go into specifics, he tried to fuck us over. We sorted it out and I'm only going to say this - it's really cool if you have your crew behind you, because that was a problem I could never solve myself alone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's the real life experience that made me a real fascist because it's only the fascist-minded ("right wing" as we say here) people who were behind me in times of trouble. I always had friends outside the "scene", but it's only the fascist minded friends that really count as far as I'm concerned and I was proved right time and time again on this one. There's just something that makes us different from the rest of the crowd, call it passion or whatever.</p>

<p>Did you see this video from Bronson ("there's only you and your crew")? We really liked it here</p>
