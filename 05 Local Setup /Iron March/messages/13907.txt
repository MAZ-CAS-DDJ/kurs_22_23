	You can, but it doesn't make a huge amount of sense unless you have some German blood. As a Celt you probably have some Germanic blood, but your gods would primarily be the Celtic ones. They are not too different from the German ones.

	I don't go to church, haven't in about 15 years. I wouldn't be opposed to it if I could find a good church that wasn't cucked and gross. I worship the German gods and pray to Christ. In the end it's all the same force, just a different form. Prayers can be done very much in the Christian way, which would be asking for a specific boon or guidance in life, and being thankful to the gods. Typically you'd want to do it at a shrine while giving an offering of some sort, whether that be an appropriate fruit or herb, or a sacrifice (I don't do that) to a specific god.

	When you're done with it just a quick opinion and whether or not you'd recommend it would be good. I'm going to guess it'll be a strong yes.
