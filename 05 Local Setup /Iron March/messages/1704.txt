<p>From what I've seen on Iron March, particularly the Introductions section, the posters that would fit in at Salo are:</p>
<p>- Talleyrand</p>
<p>- Aristocrat</p>
<p>- IntellectualFascist</p>
<p>- Traum von Eisen</p>
<p>- Falls The Shadow </p>
<p>- Woman in Black</p>
<p>Since I don't really post on Iron March, perhaps you could be kind enough to contact them and inform them about Salo Forum? Tell them they'd feel much more at home there if they feel that Iron March is too lowbrow and anti-intellectual. Traditionalists, nationalists, Catholics, agnostics, fascists of all sorts are welcome there, so it doesn't matter which way they lean.</p>
<p>In addition, Salo has a chatroom where members can discuss various topics. So if there isn't as many message board posts as you'd expect, that's why. Many people discuss posts in the chatroom.</p>
<p>It's possible I missed a few names from IM, so feel free to contact whomever you feel meets the requirements I mentioned.</p>
