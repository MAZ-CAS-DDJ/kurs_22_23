	Well, I actually was a member for about 2 or 3 years, I think closer to 2 actually. Also, yeah I intend to get rid of some of "my" or more accurately my grandfather's on my mother's side(since I left the masons) masonic stuff, including his ring. Though, that would have to wait though until after my mother passes on (which I am not looking forward too), because she has never forgiven me for leaving the masons, even though it was over 3 or 4 years ago now. Still to this day has not forgiven me btw.
