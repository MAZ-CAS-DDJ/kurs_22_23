	I know, right? &lt;3 Obviously, my standards aren't that impossibly high. But that's close to my image of what "the perfect man" looks like physically.<br /><br />
	I'm sure he has tons of helpful advice, The Golden One's obviously put a ton of effort into his body. You don't look like that without having a very well-planned fitness schedule and a good diet.<br /><br />
	Classic Schwarzenegger's body is also very nice. He's actually mostly who I meant about (as far as bodybuilders go, with their "rippedness &gt; strength" mentality) occasionally finding the heavyweight type attractive, mostly because their body type does resemble natural-looking muscle when rested, even if they come to it from a diametric opposite end than the powerlifters. From what I'm told though, classic Schwarzengger used steroids pretty regularly?
