	If they refuse to change and accept their origins then they need to be wiped one way or another. Serbian national corps has been fragmented so much in the past century that we can not tolerate it. When the right time comes, either they will join us as brothers as they are or perish as traitors to their own kind. <br />
	Slovaks existed and they exist now, Croats existed but not anymore, and those descended from historic ones are no where in the lands where the Serbs reside. <br />
	We had no chance in period 1945-1991 because we weren't ruled by Serbs, but by communists, Croats and Jews. and After WW2 we were inspired by Pan-Slavism and were glad liberating Slovenes, Serbs and Croats from A-H empire. We had a chance to separate from little Croatia but majority still saw that we need to be united. That unity has cost us more than 200 000 dead, a demographic catastrophe we are never going to recover in anytime soon.<br />
	If I was a chauvinist I would hate Hungarians and Bulgarians too, but I don't. We are just rational and learned from devastating mistakes of our ancestors. No comradeship will there ever be between us and Croats. Hope I get to see the day we repay them.
