<p>Theology?

As long as what we take supports basic need it is allowed. I believe it was St Augustine who said that as long as the thief needs what is stolen more than the merchant needs the profit, it is lawful in the eyes of God.<br /><br />Here is edict #2408 of the Universal Catechism of the Catholic Church.: <span><span>“The seventh Commandment forbids theft, what does the usurpation of somebody else's goods (against the reasonable will of its owner) mean? There is no theft if the permission can be presumed (if we can suppose that the owner would allow us to dispose of the goods which are taken by us), or the refusal is contrary to reason and to the universal destination of the goods (if the owner could not deny it with solid arguments, or if his refusal was opposed to the destination that God has given to material goods in order to help the needs of every man). <em>That is the case of urgent and evident want, where the only way to remedy the essential and immediate need (food, housing, dress…) is to dispose and use somebody else goods</em>(cf. GS, 69. 1)</span></span><br /><br />St Thomas Aquinas also went into depth on the intersection of Sin and Theft and the difference between theft and robbery under Question 66 of his Summa Theologica.  He came to the conclusion that Ida's vacuum theft is not a sin <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /><br /><br /><br /><br />No, it's not gay do not worry.
