	Facing charges. Which is funny, because as soon as it goes to court (which it probably will since people are refusing to get their shit together) and people find out that "Disorderly Conduct" qualifies as *two* posters, nobody is going to take this shit seriously. On the other hand, Harassment and Intimidation is only what I've experienced and when I cite the amount of time I've had to spend, including the time under questioning, and including the amount of calls I've been spammed, and the effect it has had on my studies, it will be apparent.<br /><br />
	This hypocrisy, idiocy, and downright PROOF of a culturally marxist, corrupted system is and has served only to motivate me further and prove to those around me the far reaches and effects of cultural marxism. The absurd pursuits of my absolute destruction by those identifying as the "tolerant defenders of social justice", their clear quoted motives to "bring me down completely", and their efforts to burn me have and will fail. I remain steadfast, resolute, and still peaceful. As a result, I have backers, I have friends as well; People who have seen and realized. Maybe they don't identify with me, maybe they don't call themselves nationalists, but they have seen the true face of what I oppose. <br /><br />
	I can't exactly Post publicly until this shit is resolved. People are still actively reading everything I post and tracking me. Until this situation is resolved, Until I bring them down with facts, logic and reasoning, or until I have to resort to extreme measures.<br /><br />
	But the damage is done and my life is already fucked. There will be no point in continuing studies after this and I will have to take my leave. Whatever I do from here on out doesn't matter until I leave.<br /><br />
	Although, I did head down to Erie like I planned with Mike all that year ago. The Banner was placed, and despite dodging cops on foot and in their cars for about an hour and a half (I had almost the entirety of the Bayfront P.D. looking for me) I escaped. It was the most fun I have had in a long time. On it read "The White Race is Dying, And What will you Do?" <br /><br />
	Some day, man. Some day we'll see the revolution. But it won't be anytime soon. I'll let the forum know what the result of my hearing is. If it winds up going to court, there will be countersuits and I've already got potential ACLU and Fire.Net cases (like Rockwell).
