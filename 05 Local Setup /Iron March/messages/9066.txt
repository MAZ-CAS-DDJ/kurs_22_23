<p>With time, again, the idea is that so long as there's some mod online they can keep an eye on things, so doesn't necessarily mean you must devote more time to IM, just that when you do go on IM you must also perform your duties. Again, that is if we have a big enough mod team but so far its shaping up alright.</p>

<p>The tools are simple enough and fairly intuitive but again, if you all have/get skype we'll make a mod group and I'll walk you through the steps.</p>

<p>@Bear I have no idea how it would look on a mobile device, if you use the full version of the forum then its the same as for everyone else, if you're using the simplified mobile skin then I don't have a clue. I'll add you to the mod team for now and you have a look around with how the controls operate and then you come back and say if you're in or not definitively. </p>
