	I had the option to join the Technical Military Academy but i chose the civilian route because it provided me with more means and opportunities to build a home and provide for my future family.

	I'm no slob, i go to the gym and play sports regularly and i've been in some fights in my life. Yet i don't fool myself, i'm by no means on the level of a soldier...yet.

	Bettering myself and building a group/community that can be depended on is what me and my friends aim for.Â We don't know what the future will hold, but that doesn't mean we can't do our best to prepare for it.

	If you ever need any info from Romania, from the daily life to political stuff, don't hesitate to contact me.
