			The link you sent me literally also agrees with what I'm saying. Trans people do not "become" trans, because you are born trans. If someone is number 2 then they are not a real trans person.<span style="font-size:inherit;"> </span>

<p>
	There is no such thing as a "real Trans person." Anyone who's "born Trans" is mentally ill. No sane person truly believes that they're the opposite gender. Biology and Nature is the truth and it dictates that what gender you were born as is your gender until your death, and there's nothing you can do to change that. What humans think tends to be falsehoods.

	Then it's no wonder that their civilization died. They valued degenerate untermensch that would've been gassed in NS Germany as something "sacred."
</p>

<p>
	I'm glad that these civilizations of filth are gone, and I hope America dies as well.

	They only exist in degenerate societies. A healthy Fascist society would put trannies in gas chambers.

	Any site that has a name like that belongs in the trash.
