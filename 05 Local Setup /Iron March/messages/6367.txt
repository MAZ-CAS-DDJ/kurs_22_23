<p>Hey, I'm sure you're familiar with nazi.org.uk,  and how it has redirected to heretical.com for some time now, with the original content missing.  I emailed heretical about it and through them, came in contact with a 'Paul Ballard' that currently had all those files and was intending to re-upload them within a few weeks.  I waited four months and emailed Paul again, did not hear anything.  Seems to be a BNP activist (based on a google search), so thought I'd give you his email just in case you wanted to pursue this content further.</p>
