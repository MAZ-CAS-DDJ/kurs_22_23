	In any case, if it were simply a consolidation of the materials that might be interesting enough imo. No need to produce anything "original" after all. I'm finding your notes by themselves useful seeing as it's rare to find abridged versions or interpretations of these works anywhere. I had been planning on rereading the Hermetic Tradition but your notes might do the trick.
