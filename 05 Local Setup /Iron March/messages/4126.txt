I always imagined Australia to be very politically incorrect <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" />. At least it's not as bad as Britain's, so there is still hope.</p>
<p>I don't use Facebook at the moment. I used to have an account but I deleted it because I would use it way too much and it started to distract me from school and work. I'll probably get around to making another one sooner or later.</p>
