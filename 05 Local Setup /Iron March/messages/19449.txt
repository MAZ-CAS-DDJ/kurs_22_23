	What I wanted to say that I don't believe in a "nanny state". Modern western society is full of useless degenerates who constantly feel entitled to something and blame everyone but themselves if they don't get it.

	I believe that the state should only create suitable conditions for good life but if you waste all your opportunities, it's your fault and your problem.

	"Welfare of the nation" is a very vague phrase as every nation is a group of individuals who can have very diverse definitions of welfare and thus it's not possible to satisfy everyone (in other words, no matter what the state does, you'll always have some people saying that it's not doing its job).
