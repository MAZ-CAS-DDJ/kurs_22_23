<p>[2012-02-25 19:24:11] &lt;ProPatriaMori[iM]&gt; Sounds about right to me.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:24:30] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; It is to an extent, I've always thought of it as the Middle ground between Capitalism and Syndicalism</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:25:09] &lt;ProPatriaMori[iM]&gt; Modern Russia has a similar system where they have "National Champions," basically monopoly-corporations loyal to the government that serve not only profits but the State.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:25:10] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Okay, just wanted to make sure I had that correct. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:25:13] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I love Economics myself, though I do struggle with them at times. I suppose that's everyone though as Modern Economies are incredibly complex</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:26:01] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; National-Guildism is distinct from National-Syndicalism because NSy is, from my admittedly limited knowledge of it, based around a violent, dynamic revolutionaryism with corporations and such done away with in favor of syndicates in which all workers have a share and are equally represented, etc.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:26:25] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Park Chung-Hee's Korea and Modern Vietnam are the systems I've paid the most attention to. I really should give the Portuguese Estado Novo and Peron's Argentina further study though.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:26:53] &lt;William[iM]&gt; There is also the distributist method. However, I feel distributism is wholly unqualified for dealing with a modern economy based around large industry. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:27:36] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Great for small towns and rural villages. But I don't see how it could be applied to a national level. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:28:04] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Syndicalism and Distributism are great for smaller Nations that have little weight on the World Economy but still want to be regional players. No such Nation will ever truly thrive though.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:28:50] &lt;William[iM]&gt; yes</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:29:12] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Distributism is big with the National Anarchists, so that should tell you something about it haha</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:29:13] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; For instance, if say Malawi decided to become Syndicalist (or make any reform for that matter) I'd be the first to lend my support</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:30:22] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; And of course combined with Integral Nationalism. National-Guildism favors placing essential industries and necessities under State control, whilst granting control of smaller industries to Guilds. A guild in this case would be a group of small companies/workshops all placed under the aegis of a Master Craftsman. The MC would direct all his Guildsmembers in matters of quality and so forth,...</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:30:24] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; ...ensuring it met high standards. He would also represent the concerns of his Guild to the State through the Grand Council.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:30:28] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; but if Malaysia tried it I'd emphatically say no. Far too much Medical Progress come out of that Nation and I could see Radical Islamist Elements trying to prey on the Worker State.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:31:05] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Sounds a lot like Mussolini's Italy.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:37:10] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Ah, but there is also a strong cultural aspect to it. National-Guildism would strive to promote and revive arts such as poetry, music, and so forth but with a ensconced traditional reactionary viewpoint rather than a revolutionary one. Also American National-Guildism would focus strongly on Unionism combined with a NS reminiscent Blut und Boden/Kinder, Kuche, Kirche social programme</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:41:19] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I still support my Corporatist Notions a bit more, likely because of my love of Futurism, however I would not oppose and could easily support such a system in lieu of the present one.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:42:30] &lt;William[iM]&gt; ah another futurist !</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:42:42] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Pfaugh, Futurism!</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:43:06] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Although the Futurist Manifesto is lovely...</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:47:13] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Indeed! I greatly enjoy Futurism. I idealize much of it's ideas. Funny enough I knew almost nothing about it until I joined ITPF... I do miss some of our old members there.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:47:46] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; RajinCajun, UNSC Trooper, my debates with ASR, even the madness of Squadrista at times.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:52:09] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; I'm still in contact with RC, and USNC's gone Liberal. I loathed ASR though...</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 19:52:35] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; And of, course, there will never be another Squardrista</p>

<p>[2012-02-25 19:54:20] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Yes. Atleast from what I've seen on PoFo. Much more liberal.</p>

<p>[2012-02-25 20:04:48] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; damn, we need more Americans... I dont mind the Euros but their situation is just that, their own</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:05:12] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I still work with AF and AB when I can, but its hard to find a day when we can all speak</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:06:28] &lt;William[iM]&gt; The Euros aggravate me with their misguided anti-Americanism</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:06:47] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I understand criticizing us, really I do. But most of them are way off base and uninformed</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:08:42] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I work with a couple of Far-Right Asian Corporatists (one from Japan, one from Taiwan) via MSN, they actually like America. The Euros though take an entirely different stance. As a Southerner I also dont much like being called a yank.</p>

<p>[2012-02-25 20:11:36] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Most of my girlfriends have been Viets or Filipinos, I feel a lot of kinship with Eastern Cultures. I'm not much into Eastern Media because I find it odd, but the cultures themselves are  very admirable.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:12:14] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I concur. I used to hang out with a lot of east Asians </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:12:49] &lt;William[iM]&gt; one of my girlfriends was Laotian </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:13:06] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Although that is South East technically, I guess.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:13:11] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Regardless, they have a lot to offer. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:14:13] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I digress, I need to get off for a while and get some dinner going myself. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:14:18] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Feel free to stick around guys </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:14:31] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Alrighty</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:14:43] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I'll be here for a bit. Take it easy man.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:16:30] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; So, ProPatria. Where do you stand on Economics?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:18:07] &lt;ProPatriaMori[iM]&gt; Sorry I'm doing like 18 things at once.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:18:34] &lt;ProPatriaMori[iM]&gt; I don't really know where I stand on Economics, I tend to focus more on social and foreign issues</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:19:44] &lt;ProPatriaMori[iM]&gt; I'm intrigued by the more right-wing National Socialist economics. A directed economy where business still exists</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:19:52] &lt;ProPatriaMori[iM]&gt; for the service of the State</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:21:00] &lt;ProPatriaMori[iM]&gt; But I still go all-out "FC" when I'm messing with liberals, low taxes-low regulation standard conservative trollbait</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:26:04] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I love baiting liberals. Actually IM is one of the few places I speak openly of my ideas. On youtube and even sometimes on Facebook I just try to get reactions out of people.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:26:21] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I support Corporatism myself.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:27:01] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Strongly, but I can look past not supporting it. I just dont care much for extreme Biological Racism or Democracy; those are the biggest deal breakers.</p>

<p>[2012-02-25 20:31:25] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; and I asked PPM his feelings on Economics</p>

<p>[2012-02-25 20:33:28] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Since things are kinda slow now</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:36:33] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Nein, do not.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:37:07] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Let us discuss a political party/movment and how to go about creating one.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:37:59] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Alrighty, the first step is to gain members/supporters</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:38:26] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Obv.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:38:31] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Well, actually we should draw up a manifesto first and foremost</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:39:38] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Of course. Perhaps Nat Fed/Nat Guild fusion?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:39:55] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I'll pitch in </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:40:02] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I could agree to that, however there needs to be more input than from just you and I</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:40:05] &lt;William[iM]&gt; (jumping back and forth here) </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:40:13] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Ah, I hear ya</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:40:45] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; AF, and AB should be here... although the formers schedule is hard to work around and the latter cant be</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:40:47] &lt;William[iM]&gt; UltraNationalist wrote up some kind of manifesto I believe as well. And then there is Jacob's stuff</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:40:57] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Ferrets input would be welcome too</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:41:06] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Ferret is a great guy </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:41:10] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I talk with him on Skype</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:41:26] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Of course, I was just throwing out ideas.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:41:48] &lt;William[iM]&gt; If we could get just a few more of us from the boards in here, I am sure we could come up with a 10-20 point plan that we could all agree on </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:42:01] &lt;William[iM]&gt; But I have to say, this is a much better improvement than the last one we tried. </p>

<p>[2012-02-25 20:55:24] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Yeah, I just remember random terms from my intro to US</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:55:28] &lt;William[iM]&gt; ProPatriaMori[iM]: send it my way as well</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:55:42] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Feel free to send it to me</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:55:43] &lt;ProPatriaMori[iM]&gt; ok</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:55:46] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; @PPM, please do. I came up with a 'Traditionalist manifesto' awhile ago. I think it's still on the US subforum.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:55:59] &lt;ProPatriaMori[iM]&gt; haha my name was Copperhead when i wasted time on SF</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:56:04] &lt;William[iM]&gt; In fact, it may be easier to upload it to like pastebin and link us all </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:56:19] * William[iM] groans at the name SF</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:56:22] &lt;ProPatriaMori[iM]&gt; it's all txt ill just PM it on IM</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:56:30] &lt;William[iM]&gt; okay sounds good</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:56:41] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; I recently made a post on Oswald Spengler, it has some useful links, good reading</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:56:50] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I saw that, good work</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:56:54] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; I was registered on SF for a while. 'Twas a pit.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:56:57] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I want to draw up a National Federalist Manifesto, we need more people for a decent one. I might even try to get my friend who I'll refer to as Drake in on it.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:56:57] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; In case anyone's interested</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:56:59] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I am knee deep in "Prussianism and Socialism"</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:57:05] &lt;ProPatriaMori[iM]&gt; ima see if i uploaded it, i might have to wait for my laptop to get back from iraq</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:57:11] &lt;William[iM]&gt; lmao </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:57:14] &lt;ProPatriaMori[iM]&gt; hopefully its backed up</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:57:15] &lt;William[iM]&gt; My last name is Drake Elegos</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:57:17] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Prussianism and Socialism ftw</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:57:32] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Really? It's the Middle Name of the friend I'm referring to</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:57:37] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Ah </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:57:39] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Yes</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:57:40] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; It's interesting. I'm currently reading 'The Decline of the West' he touches upon a lot of thoughts I've had previously.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:57:53] &lt;William[iM]&gt; kind of mildly humorous </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:58:01] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I wrote up that big call to arms a while ago </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:58:08] &lt;William[iM]&gt; that seemed to get some positive reaction. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:58:10] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I su;ppose I really dont care if you all know my actual name. You can refer to me as Joe/Joe Wearden. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:58:24] &lt;William[iM]&gt; We should really get in touch with Jacob and should all be contributing to Reaktion </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:58:34] &lt;William[iM]&gt; William Drake </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:58:38] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; I already contributed a short story</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:58:39] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Nice to meet you Joe </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:58:41] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I showed Decline of the West to a formerly Anarcho-Commie friend, he's coming around to our way of thinking.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:58:50] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Indeed</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:59:10] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Fuck, I have to send shit to both AB and Elegos. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:59:10] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; If you want I can send it to you, but it might spoil the release of the 4th issue</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:59:45] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I'll wait for it </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:59:52] &lt;William[iM]&gt; When is the Reaktion deadline, anyone know? </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 20:59:53] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; I really want to get my hands of DotW, but I've saving for a nice hardcover. Shit's expensive.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:00:05] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; It doesn't have one</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:00:06] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Soon, I think.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:00:10] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; I know AB is seriously working on it now</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:00:16] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; But there  isn't a formal deadline</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:00:31] &lt;William[iM]&gt; iĺl probably just contribute my New America piece and get working on some good stuff for the next one</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:00:35] &lt;William[iM]&gt; would like to contribute quite a bit </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:00:57] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I'm working on an Article about the old Federalists... it's going to be part of a series.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:01:29] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I've researched them so extensively, their rise and fall is an interesting story.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:01:36] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; It would be interesting to hear what you all think about them</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:01:43] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Particularly you, joe/elegos</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:02:13] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; From what I've read they just seem as a very British, elitist, northern merchant party</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:02:46] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; True School of American Conservatism. If the Racial Divide wasn't so palpable, Britain wasn't so mistrusted and America was already Industrial we'd be far better off. A True North American Empire could have emerged.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:02:49] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; I suppose I can just send in some of Tyrssen's stuff if I can get my promised piece in...</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:02:59] &lt;William[iM]&gt; They were predominantly urban, upper class, and favored a strong, authoritarian government over the small, weak one of the Jeffersonians </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:03:37] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; They were strongly against expansion</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:03:43] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; They were Capitalist in many ways, but still wanted State Intervention in much... I think they would have evolved into Fascism if given enough time.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:03:52] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Absolutely</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:04:04] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; So was Jefferson, but that didn't stop the Louisiana Purchase</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:04:17] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Because of the popularity of the Democratic-Republicans we have kind of been stuck in this perpetual rut </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:04:24] &lt;William[iM]&gt; The only time we broke out of it is with FDR</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:05:05] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; The Federalists wanted to bring Canada in first, then Louisiana. I believe one of the Pickney family had an outline for how expansion would go.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:05:22] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Teddy was decent too, however FDR was our best modern president by far</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:05:47] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Teddy was good but unfortunately couldn't follow through on his goals while in office. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:05:52] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Still though, they were strongly sectionalist and favored secession </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:06:01] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Had he won with the Progressive Party, watch out </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:06:31] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; They opposed all expansion out of party grievances, and severely destabilized the north during war with Britain</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:07:11] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; That much I could never support, there were misguided members. Especially after Hamilton's death. They were still decent in Delaware however.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:07:56] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; That was their last stronghold... eventually all its members became Whigs, though they were definitely the more Conservative branch.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:10:00] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Speaking on Teddy Roosevelt, he has gained a lot of popularity in the last few years</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:10:12] &lt;William[iM]&gt; We should use that to our advantage </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:11:04] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; its possible, but I believe that may be because of liberal obsession with 'progressivism' they use it to sell cultural Marxism.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:11:09] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Indeed, actually Figlio and I at one point considered using the moniker 'Bull-Moose' but I ultimately dismissed the idea because Teddy himself was the party in many ways.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:11:22] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Yes</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:11:34] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; True entirely Vlad</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:11:46] &lt;William[iM]&gt; They were able to gain quite a lot of local offices but could never hold out after his death</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:12:04] &lt;William[iM]&gt; He even called his plan "New Nationalism"</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:12:30] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Political party....</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:12:35] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Something that was sorely needed after the reign of every president since Grant... </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:13:57] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Hmm, well as for a Party. We need to establish a singular premise. Everything done is for the Good of the Nation. We need slogans and such. I can think of a few around certain issues, but not a general one.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:15:06] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; "America First"?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:15:26] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I think we should make sure to show historical precedence for what we are doing. Make sure it doesn't seem foreign and give it a grassroots feel. We should highlight presidents like Washington, Adams, and the Roosevelts </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:15:37] &lt;William[iM]&gt; We should use familiar symbols too </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:15:56] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; My thoughts exactly. We cant use militant aesthetics; it's going to alienate the public.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:16:17] &lt;William[iM]&gt; No runes or jackbooted street marches or anything like that. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:16:21] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Also we cant put Mussolini's face on a banner or anything. That's political suicide.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:16:49] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; I've always been fond of the America First movement; Isolationism being so dear to me.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:16:58] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Browns and Royal Blues</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:17:08] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Put Charles Lindbergh on your list</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:17:37] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I'll still wear my Combat Boots and Flight Jackets at concerts, but never at a rally or anything. For something like that it's better to look presentable; klike a decent human being.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:17:39] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; YES. And on a side note, no Adams'. Too colorless.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:18:13] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I'm not an extreme Isolationist, but I can agree America needs to focus on her immediate problems and those of her allies</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:18:30] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Adams colorless? He came in #7 on a list of the most popular presidents</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:19:10] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; We need to deport illegals, place a moratorium on immigration, and focus on mass assimilation.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:19:17] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; And yes, colorless.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:19:30] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I personally like the Columbia imagery </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:19:43] &lt;William[iM]&gt; but it is a bit outdated</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:19:44] &lt;William[iM]&gt; <a href="http://historicimagesrestored.com/images/Columbia-calls.gif" rel="external nofollow">http://historicimagesrestored.com/images/Columbia-calls.gif</a></p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:19:54] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Kacen, on the forums, has made some modern American logos </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:20:00] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Thats actually really cool</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:20:01] &lt;William[iM]&gt; and symbols</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:20:32] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Kacen has some decent design abilities... I'm told he's really into transhumanism but every conversation I've had with him was decent.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:20:47] &lt;ProPatriaMori[iM]&gt; i sent it william/dux. im afraid i was a lot more democratic (with a lower-case D) back then so it has some soft stuff in there</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:20:47] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; I have a question for everyone: are you organizing a real party's doctrine and party, or are you just talking about nice things to hypothetically have? If its the second one, does anyone here have a formal nationalistic political group, of any variety?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:21:17] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I'm all for a full on party</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:21:18] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; It's a bit of both. I'm trying to brainstorm a draft for a first Manifesto</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:21:22] &lt;William[iM]&gt; by the way I have to go guys</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:21:24] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Wife is home</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:21:27] &lt;William[iM]&gt; talk to you all later</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:21:29] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Ah, gotcha</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:21:32] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Have a good one</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:21:43] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Later, send her our best wishes</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:22:13] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; So Vlad, where in Russia are you located?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:22:33] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Odessa</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:22:41] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Ah, I see</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:22:51] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Technically it isn't Russia, it's the "Ukraine"</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:23:03] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Ukraine is like one of those bands that gets offended when you place the word 'the' before it</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:23:16] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; an ancestor of mine was a Tatar. I believe from Crimea. Kind of differing opinions on that in the family.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:23:47] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Scratch that haha, she is going straight to bed. Long day apparently</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:23:55] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Crimea or Poland, they argue about it here and there</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:23:56] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; it's a great place to live</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:24:03] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; I really do love Columbia imagery, but I disdain Kacen's normally although his vexillology. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:24:18] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Kacen is a good guy </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:24:25] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I speak with him some on Skype</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:24:39] &lt;William[iM]&gt; We should put personal differences aside. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:24:44] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; *his vexillology is good.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:24:47] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Or at least try </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:25:14] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I need to use Skype more. I'm mostly on MSN. And yes I agree we cant let personal differences tear our unity apart.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:25:22] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; At least among the Americans</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:25:27] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; lol</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:25:37] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; I'm in solidarity with all nationalist movements</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:25:57] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; What ever helps nationalism fight liberalism is good in my book</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:25:59] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Yeah, fuck the Euros for all I care</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:26:04] &lt;William[iM]&gt; America, fuck yeah!</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:26:18] &lt;William[iM]&gt; &lt;joking of course&gt;</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:26:23] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; So long as it isn't too Democratic or Capitalist I'm fine with it.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:26:28] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; And Vladimir, I'm really striving to put together a nationalist group; although I may just put together a Nat-Guild and/or Isolationist group and then recriut from there.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:26:45] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; And I'm more than willing to put aside differences.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:26:52] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Except for UN.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:26:57] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; *recruit</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:26:59] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; like a real operational cell or an internet thing?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:27:26] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Internet, then cell. Cell comes much later however.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:27:43] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; I have a small band of friends</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:28:00] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I try to recruit locally and convince people I meet at Social gatherings and such of my ideas. Though beer doersn't help people understand much. I've brought a number of people over to my way of thinking.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:28:06] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Thats really the best way to go by, if you're interested in making a real change.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:28:17] --&gt;| AMFED (chatzilla@hide-8FF6C5FB.omah.qwest.net) has joined #AmericanFascism</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:28:21] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Better than nothing. Even though the vehicle for change will be empty, it'll sit there until I can fill it.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:28:25] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Hello AMFED</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:28:34] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Hey Revival. glad you're here.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:28:34] &lt;AMFED&gt; Hey!</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:28:40] =-= Mode #AmericanFascism +v AMFED by William[iM]</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:28:45] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; A friend of mine, Austin used to be an Anarchist and quite Liberal. Now he's reading Gentile and Spengler and identifying as a Conservative Revolutionary</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:28:48] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Great crowd, I'm proud guys haha</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:28:55] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; American_Federalist?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:28:58] &lt;AMFED&gt; yes</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:29:03] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Hey there. Is that Phil?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:29:06] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Wilkommen Kamerad</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:29:07] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Ah</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:29:10] &lt;AMFED&gt; yep</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:29:16] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Excellent to see you made it</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:29:34] &lt;AMFED&gt; just got off work</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:29:39] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I was actually saying I wanted your input here earlier.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:30:00] &lt;AMFED&gt; Revolution is essential</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:30:06] &lt;AMFED&gt; that's that.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:30:18] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Explain</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:30:19] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Um...no.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:30:25] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Do explain.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:31:28] &lt;AMFED&gt; We simply cannot make our aims come to be by using the democratic system, first we gain sympathy and organize</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:31:33] &lt;William[iM]&gt; That was the general topic, we have strayed quite a bit but I'd love to hear your thoughts</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:32:53] &lt;AMFED&gt; We arent counter-revolutionaries we simply are a rival revolutionary force as I've heard it said.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:33:21] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I am not opposed to the democratic system at all. I see entryism mixed with light revolutionary/counter-cultural efforts happening amongst the youth being our best option,</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:33:27] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Look at the 60s.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:34:11] &lt;William[iM]&gt; The New Left took over the Democratic party while the crazy, radical hippies were out in the streets stirring up trouble and shifting cultural ideas</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:34:20] &lt;AMFED&gt; I'm not against Entryism and counter-cultural efforts but if we want it our way, it has to be revolutionary.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:34:52] &lt;William[iM]&gt; When you say revolutionary, you mean seizing power through means other than the democratic process, yes?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:35:02] &lt;AMFED&gt; Indeed.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:35:08] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Got it. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:35:15] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; What we should be looking at now is raising the hatred of the modern world in the general populace. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:35:36] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I just don't see how that could be a viable option for us in America. Our system is sealed tigin my opinion. ht </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:35:45] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; The easiest to convince of that Vlad are those who are into Conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:35:46] &lt;William[iM]&gt; ugh </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:35:47] &lt;William[iM]&gt; sorry</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:35:53] &lt;William[iM]&gt; *sealed tight in my opinion </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:36:02] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Democratic means are means, they should be used whenever functional. However, our success will be measured in hearts and minds not votes.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:36:23] &lt;AMFED&gt; Yes, exactly.  you can't have a successful revolution without sympathy in the general populace.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:36:38] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I really like that quote Vlad</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:36:56] &lt;William[iM]&gt; While that may be true, America is a huge country. The demographics are too divergent to come to that coherent of a consensus </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:36:57] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Well, your quote</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:37:06] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; The most effective way to win this sympathy is make it clear in the eyes of the people that all their troubles are a result of the modern order.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:37:15] &lt;AMFED&gt; Propaganda.  This is why we need a think-tank rather than a party.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:37:44] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; You will not get a large group of followers, but you can get a strong and loyal group of operatives which will agitate and win over the youth: that is all we will ever need.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:38:33] &lt;AMFED&gt; So be it, we already have a sort of sympathy anyway, people crave order in these times.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:38:41] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I've taken to saying that the problem is a spiritual disease, an "Obsession with Materialism" and it's the cause of most Modern suffering. It sounds fancy to people really into Conspiracy Theories and such.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:38:48] &lt;AMFED&gt; terror, recession, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:39:23] &lt;AMFED&gt; Do we want those people involved though?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:39:35] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; What do you mean by "those people"?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:39:50] &lt;AMFED&gt; Conspiracy nuts.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:40:40] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; No, we don't</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:40:43] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Because any extra set of hands is welcome</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:40:44] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Any resources will be useful as long as they subsume themselves to the party doctrine and accept the general trend of nationalism. If they make their critical issue pure national spirit and place their other beliefs in second place, they should not be an issue but an effective asset.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:40:56] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Excactly</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:41:18] &lt;AMFED&gt; Well, their eccentricities may be of use, imagine the dedication.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:41:25] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I tell them to stop worrying about 9/11, Illuminati, etc. It will do no good and you'll look like a lunatic</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:41:43] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; If you want to combat it, follow these values</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:42:26] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Exactly, there are far worse things that are much simpler and more logical: just a few people in power and it doesn't matter what they do secretly. What they do openly is bad enough.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:42:46] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Redirect their hatred of NWO, ZOG, Illuminati, etc. to modernity</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:42:59] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; The problem is that most people don't look at these obvious things, and focus on mystical illogical things.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:43:11] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Yes, there's a lot of energy to be exploited</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:43:20] &lt;AMFED&gt; Fascism in itself is quite mystical.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:43:28] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Indeed</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:43:35] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Fascism is not a political movement, it is a spiritual one</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:43:38] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Like, they don't look at the widespread Marxism of university proffessors but they focus on ridiculous and total non-issues </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:43:56] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Talking about 'conspiracy nuts'</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:44:06] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Mussolini trademarked the name but he was describing a spiritual pattern man has exhibited since his gs</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:44:22] &lt;William[iM]&gt; beginnings*</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:44:24] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Fascism is natural and organic though. If you can teach people not to fear it, they will embrace it on their own.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:44:49] &lt;William[iM]&gt; excuse the typos guys, Linux hates this keyboard and I haven't bothered to fix it. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:44:55] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; You don't even need to use 'fascism' do what ben did and say 'integralism' or something</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:45:22] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I use the term Federalist</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:45:33] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Though I do say Fascism to those in the know</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:46:06] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; The point is to sell an aggressive, youthful spirit. A state of mind, and the political implications will come on their own.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:46:08] &lt;AMFED&gt; So, let's talk organization, How would a revolutionary think-tank look?  and on fascism;  It's Ultranationalist Organicism, everyone born into the nation past, present and future, all of that blood and energy is apart of the nation, they are like cells that die but the body lives on.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:46:12] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I'd be willing to adopt the federalist moniker </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:46:30] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; NAAP 2012. This isn't that bad, PPM.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:47:08] &lt;William[iM]&gt; When it comes to revolutionary politics, we need to look to the left. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:47:29] &lt;AMFED&gt; I wrote an article for reaktion about that.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:47:30] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Indeed, the Left has the right idea. There's a reason they've gotten so much done that way.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:47:31] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Model ourselves on them and their tactics. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:47:51] &lt;William[iM]&gt; They have tomes filled with revolutionary theory and practice. They are active and radical. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:48:17] &lt;William[iM]&gt; We need to adopt that kind of process if we want to seriously adopt a revolutionary approach</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:48:26] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Don't model too closely. Bear in mind that they were never grassroots, they never appealed to the will of the masses, and they've always had special-interest groups and sections of the state willing to support them.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:48:46] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Most fascist I meet think revolution is A) Overthrow government B ) Kick out liberals C) profit</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:48:46] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Really my time on RevLeft, Ernesto-Guevara and various other places can help us a bit on that count.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:48:47] &lt;AMFED&gt; this coming issue.  I've been heading towards a National-Maoist Vangard type of organization, thank James Mason for that.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:49:26] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Ah! thanks for reminding me, I need to check out his stuff</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:49:59] &lt;AMFED&gt; Well, it needs to be overthrown.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:50:24] &lt;William[iM]&gt; What is the opinion of transitional states? </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:50:25] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; The left was always an intellectual movement- it has nothing to do with people's will, nationalism or any organic idea. Theirs was always about state force, and manipulating good-natured, common people into submitting.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:50:41] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Vladimir, are you familiar with realpolitik? </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:50:50] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; not really, no</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:50:51] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; what is it?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:51:27] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; nvm</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:51:32] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; I understand what you mean now</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:51:47] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Different term in Russian I take it?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:51:57] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Stripping away ideological names and concepts and using what works for your goals. So yes, the left has historically been an intellectual movement but their tactics work in regards to the revolutionary stage.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:52:10] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; That's not the point- the left organized on different lines because they had different ideas therefore different people appealed</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:52:17] &lt;William[iM]&gt; So we should use them, even if their motivations/aims are not the same aas ours</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:52:19] &lt;William[iM]&gt; *as</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:52:37] &lt;AMFED&gt; so.  We need to study organization I think and DIY publishing and things of that nature. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:52:49] &lt;AMFED&gt; A casapund for America if you will</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:52:58] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; ^This is good idea</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:53:07] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; A lot of people cite Bismark as the progenitor, but it's been used for centuries. Matternich and Ashikaga Takuji come to mind</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:53:14] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Takauji*</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:53:29] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Bear in mind, the left never could organize something like CasaPound, which is an example of what I was talking about.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:53:34] --&gt;| Dux[iM]_ (chatzilla@hide-9823956D.sub-97-21-174.myvzw.com) has joined #AmericanFascism</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:54:36] &lt;AMFED&gt; So let's start simple, a name for such a think-tank?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:55:02] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Between us, when I recieve my inheritance (though I'm not looking forward to that day) I plan on trying to get something like CasaPound off the ground.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:55:10] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Something like this 
</p>
<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo"><div><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BJm4LNuucnI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div></div> would be good for America<p>[2012-02-25 21:55:19] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Narodniy Sobor</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:55:23] &lt;William[iM]&gt; CasaPound is good, yes. I would have the AmericanCasaPound clone working with the youth </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:55:24] &lt;Dux[iM]_&gt; ...Inheritance?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:55:30] |&lt;-- Dux[iM] has left irc.foonetic.net (Ping timeout)</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:55:45] =-= Dux[iM]_ is now known as Dux[iM]</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:55:47] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Anyone remember the Occidental House?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:55:57] &lt;AMFED&gt; I plan on putting some of my own money into an organization as well.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:56:05] &lt;William[iM]&gt; If we have anyone older, they should be working on philosophical treatises and getting elected into local offices</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:56:18] &lt;William[iM]&gt; You two should work together. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:56:20] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; My Father has a Trust Fund that was set up by my Grandfather after his Death. My Grandfather was a fairly wealthy man. He left most of his money to the Catholic Church however.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:56:22] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; And I too, at some point. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:56:39] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I will be in the Army come June, so I will be limited in what I can do</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:57:08] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Sounds like a good and pious man. William, who were you referring to?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:58:18] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I'm in my early 20s and still need to go back to School. Might join the Army eventually however. Maybe after either I could really get a movement going.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:58:25] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Elegos and AMFED should work together and pool their funds</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:58:54] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; I'm thinking about a NatGuild vanguard organisation in addition to a broader think-tank. The tank's name has to be vaguely PAC-ish though. Alliance for American Values or something along those lines.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:58:57] &lt;William[iM]&gt; One movement is better than two</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:59:09] &lt;William[iM]&gt; be it a think tank or party or youth program</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:59:09] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Are you all from the same part of the country?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:59:11] &lt;William[iM]&gt; whtever</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:59:16] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Dux and I are</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:59:21] &lt;AMFED&gt; Lets work on one first.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:59:27] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; I've always preferred a variety.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:59:41] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; And Fasces lives in DC, speaking of locations.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 21:59:49] &lt;AMFED&gt; eh, but we musn't spread to thin at first.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:00:08] &lt;William[iM]&gt; agreed</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:00:14] &lt;William[iM]&gt; We need to have unity</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:00:21] =-= Mode #AmericanFascism +v Dux[iM] by William[iM]</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:00:45] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; I offer that whatever organization you guys are starting should be paramilitary/youth group in nature.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:00:57] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Blackshirt Matt lives one state over, also Ferret is from the city I live in</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:01:03] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; That would give you a lot more opportunities than a 'think tank'</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:01:12] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I'd like to work with both of them</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:01:20] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; So it seems we all live in clusters...</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:01:29] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; You're seriously onto something then</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:01:38] &lt;AMFED&gt; except me in the middle of the country...</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:01:41] &lt;AMFED&gt; damn it.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:02:12] &lt;William[iM]&gt; haha</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:02:13] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Houston has a lot of opportunities. Unfortunately the Individualism and secessionism is everywhere</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:02:14] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; And I'd be up for helping a youth/paramilitary movment grow; just not as the main organisation. Revival, where do you live?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:02:28] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Hes from Nebraska</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:02:31] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Jacob is from Illinois I believe?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:02:38] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Indiana</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:02:41] &lt;AMFED&gt; Omaha, Ne</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:02:49] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I mean, he isn't on board but I cannot imagine him not being so</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:03:04] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; He told me to fill him in on the details</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:03:08] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Got it</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:03:09] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; we talk over the phone once a week</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:03:13] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I need to get my number to him</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:03:16] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I keep forgetting</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:03:48] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I can be called but cant make Long Distance calls. Until I have enough money saved and I get new glasses I've got no cell</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:03:56] &lt;William[iM]&gt; ouch</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:04:12] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Mine is based on carriers, so I am reluctant to give out my number.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:04:27] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; With 300 a week from my job I could try saving more... but I have no insurance so glasses are costly</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:04:43] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Ah, understandable</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:05:13] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; So, Matt is in Nebraska, Jacob in Indiana, Revival in Nebraska, and WHAMS is in Iowa. Mid-Country cell?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:05:24] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Matts in OK</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:05:41] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Dux, you and I are in Va. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:05:46] &lt;AMFED&gt; Where in IA?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:06:07] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Blood and Iron from the forum is from Va</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:06:10] &lt;William[iM]&gt; as well</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:06:14] &lt;AMFED&gt; Matt?  What's his display name?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:06:21] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Damn, I need to look at a map once in a while.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:06:22] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Blackshirt Matt</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:06:23] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I talk to him on Skype, could try and get him in</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:06:24] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Blackshirt_Matt</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:06:28] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Hes not very activer anymore</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:06:35] &lt;AMFED&gt; Eh.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:06:39] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; but he and I used to talk on FB a lot</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:06:48] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; @William- Indeed we are</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:06:58] &lt;AMFED&gt; WHAMS is the National socialist correct?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:07:09] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; yes</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:07:17] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Yup, the one FC has a crush one.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:07:28] &lt;AMFED&gt; lol</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:07:34] &lt;AMFED&gt; ridiculous</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:07:41] &lt;William[iM]&gt; "sweet cheeks"</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:07:48] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; FC, he's become the present IM Court Jester</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:07:49] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; everyone sure made a lot of hype over that</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:07:57] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; maybe he was just trolling?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:07:59] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; @William- BaI is in Hampton Roads, IIRC.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:08:00] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; or drunk...</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:08:06] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Yep </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:08:13] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Nah, FC is too foolish to troll.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:08:25] &lt;William[iM]&gt; He is Hampton Roads, I am in Richmond and you are in Fairfax?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:08:44] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Best to stay off the internet when you're drunk... you tend to make a lot of typos. Also if you're on FB and trying to flirt with the ladies it just looks funny.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:08:50] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Prince William/Loudon.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:08:54] &lt;William[iM]&gt; got it</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:08:59] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Vodka=/=Foxes</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:09:05] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; LOL</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:09:07] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Hahahahahahaha</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:09:08] &lt;William[iM]&gt; lol</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:09:12] &lt;AMFED&gt; Also, I'm free to talk via Phone.  If you want PM your Phone # at IM.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:09:44] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Same</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:09:47] &lt;William[iM]&gt; But anyways, moving back to this whole thing we are trying to get going. Names. Anyone? Even if it is just a general name for the movement. I am curious</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:09:48] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Personally I don't think FC is older than 13 at best.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:09:54] &lt;William[iM]&gt; FC is in his 40s</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:10:01] &lt;AMFED&gt; That goes for any of you, our biggest enemy is lack of communication.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:10:05] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; National Salvation Front?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:10:09] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; So says his account, yes.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:10:14] &lt;AMFED&gt; Something militant</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:10:24] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Oh fuck yes, NSF.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:10:25] &lt;AMFED&gt; and that sounds like the Salvation Army lol</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:10:35] &lt;William[iM]&gt; We discussed this before you came in, overt militarism will not get us anywhere. </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:10:38] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Hahaha I thought I'd throw it out there</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:10:38] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; American Worker's Party?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:10:55] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Sounds too Socialist to get any support in the South</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:10:58] &lt;AMFED&gt; too leftist sounding</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:11:00] &lt;William[iM]&gt; yep</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:11:01] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Vlad- Too socialist.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:11:19] &lt;AMFED&gt; Federalist Movement USA</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:11:19] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; National Federalist League?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:11:25] &lt;William[iM]&gt; That is good </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:11:37] &lt;AMFED&gt; which?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:11:51] &lt;William[iM]&gt; National Federalist League</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:11:59] &lt;AMFED&gt; NFL</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:12:01] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; NFL? Really? Think these things through, comrade.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:12:03] &lt;William[iM]&gt; although the sheep would be so stupid as to see NFL and think of some moron with a ball</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:12:07] &lt;AMFED&gt; hmmm</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:12:13] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I like the sound of it. National Salvation Front might bring up thoughts of Myanmar</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:12:26] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; To those in the know anyway</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:12:32] &lt;AMFED&gt; National Federalist Movement</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:12:34] &lt;William[iM]&gt; American Identity Movement </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:12:48] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; ^Too Nazi.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:12:49] &lt;AMFED&gt; sounds like christian identity</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:12:54] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Ja</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:12:55] &lt;William[iM]&gt; agh damn </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:12:57] &lt;William[iM]&gt; you are right</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:12:59] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; American Nationalist party?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:13:06] &lt;AMFED&gt; already one</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:13:11] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; so?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:13:22] &lt;AMFED&gt; We need uniqueness</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:13:24] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; ^Nope already hijacked by racist bastards</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:13:26] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Constitutional Restoration Society?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:13:38] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Sounds like libertarians and Paultaards imo</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:13:40] &lt;AMFED&gt; fuck the constitution</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:13:50] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; nononononono- you guys aren't seriously the tea party "we are the true constitution" type are you?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:13:51] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Oh gods no, think of the Teabaggers</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:13:59] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Yeah, just throwing it out there. I actually like the Constitution myself.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:14:10] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; ...Elegos is...</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:14:25] &lt;AMFED&gt; It actually doesnt gaurantee democracy</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:14:31] &lt;William[iM]&gt; American Federalist Movement has been said yes? I like the sound of that one actually </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:14:35] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; ah yes, I'm secretly a Libertarian... you know me</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:14:40] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I do too</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:14:41] &lt;AMFED&gt; AFM</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:14:41] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Not the point</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:14:45] &lt;AMFED&gt; I like it.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:15:16] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; So we have a name at least</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:15:26] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Would appear so </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:15:38] &lt;AMFED&gt; good.  What's next?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:15:39] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; it's alright</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:15:45] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; This is the most progress we've all made as Americans in ages</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:15:51] &lt;William[iM]&gt; yes indeed</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:15:53] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; On trhe forum</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:16:04] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I was talking to Slavros and said we Americans are arguably the laziest on the forums</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:16:07] &lt;AMFED&gt; William save the chat log.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:16:11] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I am</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:16:17] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Damnit no, replace Federalist with Fascist and we're teabaggers to a man.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:16:31] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; We are. Though my inactivity is partly because I work a lot</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:16:47] &lt;AMFED&gt; We haven't done much in his defense.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:16:49] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Hahaha that's not a bad point</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:16:58] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; This is much progress though, I like it. And I'll admit to bouts of laziness.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:17:25] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Federalist Restoration Society?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:17:50] &lt;AMFED&gt; Revolutionary Federalist Movement</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:17:53] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; 'society' as a word will make a new age nudist movement out of any ideology</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:17:53] &lt;AMFED&gt; lol</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:18:34] &lt;AMFED&gt; So, no agreement as of yet then?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:18:41] &lt;AMFED&gt; any other ideas?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:18:43] &lt;William[iM]&gt; would appear not</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:18:52] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; I also don't see why the word 'Federalist' has to be used. It doesn't sound too well, in purely aesthetic terms. It implies 'Federal' which sounds too like what they use to represent the modern movement.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:18:55] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; modern government*</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:19:16] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; It's the 'Federal government' so there's no use using the same word in the name of a revolutionary party.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:19:31] &lt;AMFED&gt; you're right, the common person wont tie it to Hamilton.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:19:45] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; True</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:19:47] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; Also, the Federalist tradition is too shortlived to draw seriously upon</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:19:54] &lt;AMFED&gt; What!</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:19:56] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; American Eagle Front?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:20:07] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; as for using Society... I was really just Americanizing the 'Imperial Restoration Society' haha</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:20:23] &lt;AMFED&gt; American Action Front</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:20:26] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; I mean, the party died rather quickly</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:20:33] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; i like the word 'action'</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:20:40] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; hmmm....</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:20:45] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; I'd say League of American Nationalists but its the name of a Racist group on a show called 'Sons of Anarchy'</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:20:57] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; I like American Action Front</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:21:06] &lt;William[iM]&gt; I like AAF as well AMFED</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:21:12] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; It has a ring to it I'll admit</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:21:23] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; 'Alliance to Restore National Strength'?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:21:23] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Has enough buzzwords to sound like something</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:21:31] &lt;William[iM]&gt; without givinly dissuadeg out enough info to instant</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:21:33] &lt;William[iM]&gt; fuck</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:21:40] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; What?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:21:51] &lt;William[iM]&gt; without giving enough out to dissuade</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:21:52] &lt;William[iM]&gt; **</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:21:53] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Alliance to Restore Nation Strength... I really like that one</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:21:55] &lt;William[iM]&gt; (keyboard)</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:22:20] &lt;AMFED&gt; Me to, ARNS, and you can say it as a word.</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:22:22] &lt;AMFED&gt; lol</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:22:39] &lt;William[iM]&gt; American Nationalist Underground Society </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:22:39] &lt;William[iM]&gt; or </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:22:40] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Hmm, I think thats the best we're going to get</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:22:41] &lt;William[iM]&gt; ANUS</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:22:49] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; Hahahahahas</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:22:51] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; ha</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:22:54] &lt;AMFED&gt; buahahaha</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:23:15] &lt;VladimirBorisov[iM]&gt; New Nation Party?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:23:19] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; If we go with ARNS, the thing is we stole our name from a Russian... and they said you guys were the ones copying us XD</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:23:30] &lt;Dux[iM]&gt; Already have the American Nihilist Underground Front</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:23:33] &lt;William[iM]&gt; Full disclosure, I stole that from the American Nihilist Underground Society </p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:23:36] &lt;William[iM]&gt; yes</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:23:40] &lt;William[iM]&gt; ANUS</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:23:45] &lt;William[iM]&gt; great reading, actually</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:23:51] &lt;AMFED&gt; So, AAF?</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:24:03] &lt;AMFED&gt; Action Front USA</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:24:07] &lt;Elegos_[iM]&gt; AAF, has a nice ring to it</p>
<p>[2012-02-25 22:24:22] &lt;AMFED&gt; or National Action</p>
