	I'm not really keen on discussing it in a public forum especially with strangers but it already exists, with the necessary financial capital, not millions because not every client is looking for a gunship, but rather many tens of thousands. You are severely overestimating how difficult it is. It's not a big time public operation like Academi, obviously, it doesn't have to be.
