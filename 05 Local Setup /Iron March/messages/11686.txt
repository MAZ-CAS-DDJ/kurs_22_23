<p>German race science considered height a measure of good genes. Look up SS height requirements for more info. Essentially being taller makes you more attractive to women and more respected by other men. In general the Nordic phenotype is the tallest among Europeans and Europeans are taller than all other races except a few lanky tribes from Africa. Manlets will always look like children trying to compensate for their height and imitate 'real men' no matter what they do even if they work out and act tough.</p>
