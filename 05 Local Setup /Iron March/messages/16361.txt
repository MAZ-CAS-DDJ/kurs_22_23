	Very interesting point, see I'm not quite sure. Obviously talking about fascism and ideology is main focus on this website, but from there I'm not quite sure. I want a traditionalist movement to reach Poland, and I'd love to be the head of it. I'm in speech and debate right now, and I've always had a deep desire to be head of a nation, or at least head of a party. At the moment I'm not quite ready to start a movement and/or ready to fight and die for these beliefs. The desire to stand for my beliefs, being nationalistic and such, are a main reason why I want to go into the military. The dying for my own nation, the chance to strengthen meaning in the Polish race, and the metaphysics of war spark unwavering desire and excitement. Being Catholic, with religion bound to my race, fighting and dying for God, how beautiful! I don't think I've asked what your ideology and religion are, but if we ever meet together in real life when the right time comes, we'll do something great to push true fascism forward.
