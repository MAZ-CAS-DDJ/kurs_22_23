<p>During the next conference, do you think you could review two subjects for me?The first is on phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics. It actually predates antibiotics by twenty years, but bacteriophages were poorly unerstood until the seventies. Considering the chronic overuse of antiobitics, their ill impact on the human microbiota, and the rapid production of drug resistant illnesses, it's a worthy idea to promote. Currently, not allowed in the US or Europe except in food supplies, but common in the Soviet Union, India, and southeast Asia.The other is in using prizes as an alternative to patents. Specifically, issuance of investment grants in their place. We're all familar w/ the problem of forced monopolies produced by patents, but investment grants may provide incentive and economic advantage without curbing competition. Patents actually didn't exist in Switzerland until 1907, or the Netherlands between ~1870-1912.</p>
<p>I understand these are platform issues, not generic ideals, but hopefully discussin</p>
