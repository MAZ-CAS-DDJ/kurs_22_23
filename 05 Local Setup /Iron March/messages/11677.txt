<p>When can I start? Â I wanted to write for the art section, and wanted to contact the band some of the NA guys are in and put together an interview, although I'm not totally sure how you wanted that section to be organized or what exactly you wanted in it (music will only be a part of it or will it be the feature of the month ect). How are we coordinating with other writers and such? Is there going to be some kind of group chat?</p>
