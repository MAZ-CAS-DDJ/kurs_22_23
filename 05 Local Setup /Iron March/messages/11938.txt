<p>Heil bro,</p>
<p>Was wondering about those Sigurd shirts you had posted something about a while back. I remember they said on the back "lift mountains, make bastards". Where can you buy those at? Also, if i remember correctly, they were shown as long sleeved shirts in the image, can you get them as t-shirts? Thanks in advance.</p>
