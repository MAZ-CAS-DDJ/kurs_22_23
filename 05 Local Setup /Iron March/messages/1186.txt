<p>Spent a five day vacation with my family and trucked through another 200 pages of <em>A History of the Ancient World. </em>The Ancient Greeks just might be some of the most over-rated people who ever lived; at least the Athenians. They could have avoided so much trouble if they just kept their kings. Also read about an ancient Chinese minister named Shang Yang who was basically an ancient Fascist. Actually been thinking a lot about what connections fascism/the far-right could make with ancient history, about the development of civilization-nomads to farming, tribe to nation-state, chieftain to king. In almost every example, they adopted a hierarchical, authoritarian, monarchical system. I guess it goes to show democracy is really a huge step <strong>backwards,</strong> to the barbarian days.</p>
<p>Other than that, trying to stave off romantic frustration.</p>
