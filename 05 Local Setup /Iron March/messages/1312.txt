<p>I mostly write Fantasy or Medieval stories(in the style of an epic,) each story with a moral at the end. Sometimes I also try to emulate H.P. Lovecraft's style, but I always consider them to be a failure because of their synthetic nature(they simply do not feel organic, contrary to reading one of his books.)</p>
<p>I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one who enjoys writing works of fiction on Iron March.</p>

<p>It is good to know I am not alone.  I would avoid emulation myself. I find I work best when I just write as it comes naturally.</p>
