	That's awesome!

	And if you like Tolkien and fantasy, perhaps you should look into Warhammer 40,000 - it's essentially "science fantasy," a blend of science fiction (futuristic technology, faster-than-light-travel, everything is &gt;IN SPACE) with fantastic elements (powerful gods, elves, magic/sorcerous powers, and knights - except the knights wear power armor) - kinda like the original Star Wars trilogy, where the Force was a very metaphysical/spiritual thing and the Jedi were like Buddhist warrior-monks in space (we won't talk about the prequels, though, lol).Â

	Warhammer 40K has a very Gothic aesthetic to it - the Space Marines all wear bulky, quasi-medieval power armor, and their ships literally look like cathedrals with rockets attached to them, lol
