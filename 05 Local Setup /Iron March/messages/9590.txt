<p>Thanks for the advice, I should put them up in the Johns Hopkins jewish center...</p>
<p>I had a pretty great day! I took two exams, physics and math (my worst subjects) and probably did pretty badly but that's alright. Not anything I want to do in the future anyway. Then I went to the gym with my best friend, he's leaving for the whole summer tomorrow so I won't see him for an entire year. We did an xtra long sesh, max reps max sets <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>Then I walked around the city and to my dad's place, and made that poster. Once I got back home I walked around the Johns Hopkins campus and to the art museum where I read Pound on the marble steps. There was an exquisite sunset too. </p>
<p>Life is good! Tell me more about yours.</p>
