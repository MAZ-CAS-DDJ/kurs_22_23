<p>Yeah, I'd doubt that many people would listen if you offered the route of presenting these ideas through the image of gods of the ancient world - the alien cultural nature of those deities and creeds tend to be looked on in the same way as how people responded to that Man of Steel and his shinto ordeal. What exactly defines this paganism you used to (or still do) follow about the whole Babylonian business - as in, what is the angle and form of worship that it is all about? Christianity and the monotheistic religions tend to be almost slavery to their god, and the pagan traditional religions of older people tend to simply be influences in life which are not all-encompassing and demanding, etc - and why did these foreign faiths attract you rather than Germanic Anglo-Saxon paganism? </p>

<p>Also, what's the endgame for this tactic, are you just going to let it lie and not offer anymore bible posts and arguments against Mierce - let what has been said sink in - or are you going to pop out of the cake and inform everyone of what's been happening? It'd make a few people who've been arguing for what would be the desecration of christianity's tenants feel a bit silly, I'd imagine; but at the same time perhaps open them to the flaws of it and the poor nature of the religion. </p>
