<p>Hey there! I have just been to the Oregon coast with my family, it was a good trip. It's some of the best waves around, and really beautiful shores. <a href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8237/8478263134_cf0ccfe803_n.jpg" rel="external nofollow">https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8237/8478263134_cf0ccfe803_n.jpg</a><br /><br />Other than that, I've been working my usual hotel job at night, and working on the boat docks in the daytime. Oh, and I've gotten a chance to lead young camps of kids around the woods in the mountains with a Forestry Group. How about you, how have you been? Sorry for my late replies, I only use a library computer. Not for safety, it's just the only one I have! xD<br /><br />What is svesno u desno?</p>
