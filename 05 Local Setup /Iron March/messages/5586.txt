<p>Greetings, Turk,</p>
<p>If I may ask, do you have Skype? I'd like to have some in-depth conversations with you and it would be much easier in real-time compared to private messages with a relatively formal style.</p>
<p>I find the views of most Western European nationalists and traditionalists to be foreign to the Romanian, and Balkan, spirit, with a few exceptions such as Julius Evola(who was, after all, inspired by Mircea Eliade.)</p>
<p>In a way, one could argue that the Ottomans were the heirs of Byzantium and I would clearly consider that over the Russian abberation of Moscow being the Third Rome, as your people and the Balkan nations influenced each other a lot more than the Russians that use Orthodoxy as a pretext for their imperialism.</p>
<p>Also, as a Romanian, I do not share the same irrational hatred of the Ottomans, as we were a House of Peace and had soft Ottoman rule, compared to, lets say, Bulgaria's House of Islam and their hard Ottoman rule.</p>
<p>I believe that we have things to learn from each other and friendship would be for the best, so I will await your answer on the matter.</p>
<p>Hail,</p>
<p>Honor et Patria</p>
