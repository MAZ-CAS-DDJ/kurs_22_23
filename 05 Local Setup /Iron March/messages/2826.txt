<p>It's a special group for blacks to help the Admins keep track of us.</p>
<p>Of course not - it's just the mod team. Or as the forum charter puts it:</p>
<p>"By the will of the Adminship, the <em>Black Corps</em> are an Order of Knights of the Iron March forum - the most trusted and true who embody both the values that are at the foundation of this community and of the values of their ideology. The Black Corps are entrusted with maintaining order on the forum and given <strong>Moderator</strong> status so that they may act to the best of their abilities. To become a member of the Black Corps is a great honor and an even greater responsibility, as that person becomes a living visage of those values. To fall from such grace would bring shame to our community, the Black Corps itself and to the fallen member.</p>
<p>The Black Corps is a Brotherhood - the actions of any single member reflect on all of its members. Stand together as Brothers and protect each other from falling from grace.</p>
<p>The Black Corps is an Order - it embodies the values of our community and must both serve as an example and inspiration to others. Act as older brothers to the younger comrades of our community and guide them - help them integrate and steer them away from breaking our rules and values, least they face the wrath of the Adminship.</p>
<p>You are the Knights of an Order, the keepers of discipline and defenders of our values. You are the Black Corps. Serve with Honor."</p>
