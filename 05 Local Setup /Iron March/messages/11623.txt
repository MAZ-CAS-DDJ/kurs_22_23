<p>It does. Depends on in what sense you mean. If your bloodline lives on, you live on. If your memory lives on, you live on. Your consciousness might not live on, but you are more than just your consciousness.</p>

<p>Why if each consciousness ceases to exists</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Does it? Memory is a part of your consciousness, and your memory lives on in your blood and in your deeds. Moreso in your blood. What if your consciousness continues and returns to your next body with amnesia? You'd not be able to tell the difference, except in perhaps subtle hints in your subconscious, ready to be discovered if you find the key.</p>

<p>What is the point of consciousness ?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>What is the point of life? This is a question that has been asked since the dawn of time, and I believe it is one that will never have a satisfactory answer. Another question is: Does it matter what the meaning of life is? Life simply is, and whether or not you know the meaning does not change that. You have a life, so live it to the best you can in the path of the divine, and perhaps you'll be blessed with that answer if that's what was ordained for you. If not, you will still prove your virtuous spirit by living life in the path of the divine and in your next return you may find your answer.</p>

<p>Sometimes mysteries will be unfolded by accident when you stop searching for the answer.</p>
