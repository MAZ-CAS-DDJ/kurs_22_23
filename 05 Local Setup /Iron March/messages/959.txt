Then discuss the practical applicability of such ideas in the 21st century. When I've made this plan a little more concrete I'll let you know more thoroughly what I'm planning on and you can offer approval or suggestions or whatever.</p>
<p>What kind of word-count are you looking for on this, btw?</p>
