<p>Well however you choose to go forward I'd be interested in reading more.</p>

<p>The CM thread seems to have stunned people into silence! </p>

<p>The ethno-state fascist stuff in America thread you made is really interesting. It's a lot like what the Wolves did, the basic premise that an empire is seeded in the Romulus/Remus model. A gang evolves into a tribe and then a community - city - state - nation etc. They deconstructed the process and just acted, got tribal land and went from there. We recently had a big scandal and a load of internal argument because a half breed tried to join and whilst he was told his presence was warmly received for events etc. there was no way he'd ever be allowed to be a "Wolf" as he is mixed race. He sperged out and did a "goat path in 300" on us and tried to destroy everything with Nazi accusations (which are kinda fair enough considering most Wolves wear the totenkopf on their jacket). So it's subconsciously written into the founding basis of the tribe that it's whites only.</p>

<p>I've always imagined a mini ethno state on the Russian/Finland border being really easy to achieve, lots of land, relative ease of movement into the rest of Europe. My wife and I have often considered fleeing the clusterfuck that is the UK and setting up shop in Russia but it seems contradictory, becoming immigrants etc.</p>

<p>I have a lot of hope for operations like Casa Pound and Golden Dawn, it doesn't feel like a coincidence that the greatest NS turmoil that has occurred right now in the last decade has been in Rome, Athens and Kiev, those ancient seats of Aryan creation.</p>
