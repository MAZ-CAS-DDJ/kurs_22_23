	I never understood why didn't the Romanians conquer the Serbian part of Banat. You are right about our prime minister, his name was PÃ¡l Teleki. He considered our joint attack with the Germans as a treason since there was a non-aggression pact between Hungary and Yugoslavia. On his tombstone is written: 'He gave his life for (defending) the honor of the Hungarian people'.
