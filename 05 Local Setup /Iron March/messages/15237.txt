	Yeah, it definitely wouldn't be my "main" job. Now tbh I actually don't write, I just know that in this current system academics are required to write papers and essays, so I guess I am just kind of anticipating this.Â Maybe also trying to write books of for Rightist publications as a way to earn extra income. Though, not really anticipating much success in this. More like a side project.
