<p>These boards are not what they used to be, and are also becoming way too much theistic, xenophobic and whatnot to my taste. I'm quite fed up with the rampant neo-nazism, mysoginy and jewish conspiracies obsessions. However, I seem to be the only one who cares and I don't have much time to spend here anymore - so I'm afraid I kinda gave up on these matters.</p>
<p>As for maturity, thanks but it's probably due to the fact I'm 42 while most of the members here are 20 years younger. Generational gap. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>Anyway, sorry to sound bitter, I still hope you'll find some enjoyment here.</p>
<p>Kind regards, WiB</p>
