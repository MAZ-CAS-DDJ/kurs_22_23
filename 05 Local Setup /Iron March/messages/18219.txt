	Hey mate! Was wondering the last couple of days what the polish nationalists think of National Socialism, Adolf Hitler, Azov and Ukraine. As far as I am aware - most people in Polska are heavily right wing but do they hate NS/Hitler cuz of the things of the past ? Is there a strong NS movement in Poland ? I see polish ultras constantly waving celtic crosses, white pride etc Â but what is the situation with the swastika ? Also, what do you think of Ukraine - do you see potential of co-operation between the strongest Eastern European countries ?
