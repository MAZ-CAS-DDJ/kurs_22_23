	Yes I agree, I've seen a lot of old Nationalists, especially in Germany telling people to go to the countryside and buy houses and live of the land (Which is a very good idea once the threat to our people has been defeated), however we have to face the threat now, not wait.

	I do think Varg is very wise in his videos though, I have learnt a lot from them. I also think he has red pilled a lot of people who listen to his music as well, I mean when i started listening to Burzum a few years ago I wasn't very political or aware of the threat our people faced, but after reading his blog and watching his videos I became very aware.

	A lot of members of the Black Metal subculture are leftist scum though and they tried to ban his RPG board game haha. One of the reasons I distanced myself from the metal community was because of their leftist tendencies.
