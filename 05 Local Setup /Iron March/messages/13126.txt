<p>Oh, it's fine! Thank you for apologising. I've just had a rather overwhelming day today. I think the truth of the situation lies between what you both are telling me, but I know that it's something that needs to improve regardless.<br /><br />
Thank you also for your concern, and I really hope your future isn't as bleak as you make it out to be. An ideal society is impossible regardless, and the past can never return, but I think a good, stable social order is achievable in the near future. Please don't think I have my life together either. Like most of us here, I'm young and learning.</p>
