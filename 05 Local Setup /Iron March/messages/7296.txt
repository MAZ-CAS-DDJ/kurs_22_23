<p>Yeah, i don't agree with the pro-gay stuff on Aryanism.net either, but other than that i haven't found much i disagree with. And i agree that Aryanism wouldn't be a good movement to try and build up a large following around, but their ideas can be learned among the elite of a new movement. The way i see it, is they're following Hitler's ideas, not his example. Assuming they're 100% correct on what Hitler believed in (again i say, <em>assuming</em><em>)</em>, then it makes sense why he promoted a "racist" ideology to unite Germany and help them become a folk. He wasn't trying to make racism his end goal, but merely trying to get as close to his real ideas as he could, without sounding like a tard to the public. He couldn't just come out and say "Well, there's this mythical race known as the Aryans who diffused into all populations across the earth, and they worshipped the sun and hated the Jewish demiurge, so you guys are going to be selectively bred based on your Aryan features and i'm going to try and get you to stop worshipping your Jew-God and get you to worship the real Aryan God who Jesus Christ really came in the name of. Also, i'll ban eating meat."</p>

<p>People would've never accepted that flat out, so basically what he did was say "we're a racial movement" because in a way, it was. He never really "lied", he just made it more appealing to the public until he was in a position where he could teach people the truth without being slandered by the Jews, and also have the resources to prove his points. Otherwise he'd have been seen no differently than people who make those blurry Youtube videos claiming that the world is ruled by reptilians. And this is what Aryanism seems to not understand: Nobody will follow your movement if you just flat out tell it like it is. You have to sugar-coat things a bit, sell it to them, not say "This is our ideology and if you don't like it, f*ck off." You have to make them want it, and by saying all of your intentions openly, people probably just won't want it. Then, again following Hitler's example, once you're in power, you can slowly show them the truth because you'll have the resources to do so. Politics is a game, and Hitler understood that. Of course your intentions and means of obtaining your goals should always remain based on morality and noble ideas, and you should send out a message that draws in the kind of people you want to work with, but other than that, you have to sell it to the public to get them to go along with it, otherwise you're politically obsolete.</p>

<p>I would get involed in politics but the fact of the matter is the best i could hope to do is start my own group, and at 16 that's hard to do. Not impossible, but most kids don't give two sh*ts about politics, and trying to get people to take a 16 year old seriously isn't easy. I only know one other person in my area who thinks some-what like i do, and iv'e never met him in person, only talked with him on here and Facebook, and iv'e never brought up the idea of starting a movement to him, but i guess it wouldn't be a bad idea. At least i could say i'm doing <em>something. </em></p>
