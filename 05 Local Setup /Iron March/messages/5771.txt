<p>Of course Hitler speaks of it in Mein Kampf also, the mix is half way between the two races, it is to the detriment of the superior and only of slight benefit to the inferior but it loses the fine tuned qualities of the two races. There are also the spiritual and most importantly the mental effects tied to race mixing whioh are damaging. One such set of experiments which is highly interesting for MANY reasons are these ones:</p>

<p>With miscegenation, not only are two different people being joined, but two very different ancestral epigenetics. Monoracial children only have to deal with a set of similar ancestral baggage, while biracial children have to deal with two completely different sets.  No wonder interracial marriages have such a high divorce rate and biracial children have such crippling issues with identity and behavioral problems, nevermind the incompatible genetics. I find the above link extremely fascinating not only from a racial standpoint but also a spiritual and religious standpoint. Epicurus believed as myself, that a genetic memory had been forged into our brains from the most ancient of times and for this reason we find the Gods familiar and fascinating to us. The fact that people<br />all over the world have the same legends and myths of these times displays a common source. <strong>Epicurus called this "prolepsis," </strong>which he wrote of in his STANDARD OF JUDGMENT, of the inborn knowledge of the mind that today we call genetic memory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was also a book written a long time ago which I believe was way ahead of its time (the Christian theology and slants aside), it said the same thing along these lines. I cannot for the life of me remember the title of the book, but I do have it on my comp somewhere.</p>

<p>Here are some general scientific opinions:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>EUGENICS is the science of applying the Laws of<br />Genetics toward the improvement of races and breeds. Mankind<br />is capable of passing favorable genetic characters to succeeding<br />generations, while eliminating many unfavorable<br />qualities. Man can achieve even more extraordinary results<br />than he has in the breeding of grains, fruits, vegetables, flowers,<br />livestock, horses and pets. Don't let this shock you. Man<br />IS part animal. Therefore, let us examine some of Mankind's<br />breeding practices.<p>INBREEDING has been practiced since the beginning<br />of human history. It refers to the mating of close relatives:<br />parents and siblings, brothers and sisters, and first cousins.<br />Contrary to Distorters the only injury from inbreeding<br />results from defective inheritance received: defects which<br />persisted in the stock for many generations but were hidden<br />by more dominant characters. Successful inbreeding requires,<br />for one thing, that defectives be prohibited from breeding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Instead of being condemned (inbreeding) should be commended.<br />After continued inbreeding - with the discarding of<br />undesirables - an in-bred stock has been purified and rid of<br />abnormalities, monstrosities, and serious weaknesses...<br />EDWARD M. EAST, Ph.D., LL.D., Professor, Genetics, Harvard.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>Inbreeding is only disastrous if the ingredients of disaster<br />are already in the stock....close inbreeding of a sound stock, if<br />associated with intelligent elimination of the weakly and abnormal,<br />can be practiced for many generations without any undesirable<br />consequences.<br />A. A. F. CREW, M.D., D.Sc., Ph.D., F.R.S.E., U. Edinburgh.</div></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>Inbreeding canalizes and isolates health and other desirable<br />qualities, just as it canalizes and isolates ill-health and other<br />undesirable qualities. It stabilizes the germ-plasm and this<br />causes hereditary factors to be calculable. It therefore makes<br />appearance a guide to the individual's hereditary equipment... it<br />acts as a purifier of a stock or family.<br />A.M. LUDOVICI, "The Quest of Human Quality".</div></blockquote>

<p> </p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>Infants are individuals... from the moment of birth. Indeed<br />many of their individual characteristics are laid down long<br />before birth... Every child is born with a nature which colors<p>and structures his experiences... He has constitutional traits and<br />tendencies largely inborn which determine how, what, and to<br />some extent even when he will learn. These traits are both racial<br />and familial... Racial differences are recognizable by the fourth<br />fetal month... There (are) genuinely individual differences<br />already prophetic of the diversity that distinguishes the human<br />family.<br />PROF. ARNOLD GESELL, Yale University, Pediatrics.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>...it had come to be firmly recognized that the racial factor<br />in blood transfusions was of such practical importance that Dr.<br />John Scudder, with a very distinguished career as surgeon,<br />blood specialist, medical school professor, and director of<br />blood-banks in various parts of the world, and as a blood-bank<br />advisor to our government and to several foreign governments<br />as well, in laying down the rules for the selection of blood<br />donors... specified they should be "of the patient's own race"<br />and preferably "of the patient's own ethnic group."<br />WILLIAM G. SIMPSON, "Which Way Western Man".</div></blockquote>
<p>- DEFINITELY A RECOMMENDED MUST READ</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>In blood groups, hemoglobins, and other biochemical features...<br />racial differences have been found ...just as great as the<br />better known and more conspicuous anatomical variations.<br />Being invisible to the naked eye they are much less controversial<br />than the latter in an increasingly race-conscious world. To me at<br />least it is encouraging to know that biochemistry still divides us<br />into the same sub-species that we have long recognized on the<br />basis of other criteria.<br />DR. CARLTON S. COON, Prof. of Anthropology, Harvard<br />Univ.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>Isolation has been the great factor, or at any rate an essential<br />factor, in the differentiation of the races.<br />DR. R. R. GATES, Emeritus Prof. of Botany, Univ. London.</div></blockquote>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>Unless a breeding population is contained (Isolated) natural<br />selection may be unable to eliminate old, unfavorable genes<br />from its pool.<br />DR. CARLTON S. COON, Prof. Anthropology, Harvard<br />Univ.</div></blockquote>

<p>The fact that it also just struck me as weird at first glance in addition to acknowledging a hodge podge of culture and characteristics just would not work, I constantly heard people I know and have worked with who have these exact problems with their child and it can hardly be blamed on racism when we live in the most tolerant of times... which is probably the magnifier and increaser of these problems and what a great irony that is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Negroes in Negroland and G.O. Ferguson's the psychology of the negro are also fascinating reads, in addition.</p>
