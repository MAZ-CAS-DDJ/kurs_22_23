<p>well hey good luck again bro. S America has a potentially bright future, lots of good Spanish blood down there that isn't spent, not to mention the solar history of the natives. I expect them to be one of the leading civilizations in the next few centuries. Like East Europe someone with intelligence, charisma and some money to throw around can make himself something big in a few years, if you ever make something down there that'd be a great story to share.</p>
