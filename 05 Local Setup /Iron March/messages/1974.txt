<p>An interesting story about the DPRK, if you Google ''St.Francis Xavier University" you'll see the University I attend,</p>
<p>In it, there are a variety of groups or clubs, (Fencing Club, Biology group, Polysci Group, Photography Assocation etc...)</p>
<p>I attended 4 last year,</p>
<p>1. The Polysci Comitee</p>
<p>2. The Young Conservatives</p>
<p>3. Society of Philosophers</p>
<p>4. The Congressors (Society dedicated to discussing and interpreting the ideas and thoughts of the Founding Fathers in France, Britain, Canada, and the United States among others).</p>
<p>Within these 4 I managed to found a little breakaway group called the CNP (Canadian Nationalist Party) essentially a Proto-Fascist, Traditionalist Group of individuals, of about me and roughly 20 other students.</p>
<p>We formed a Manifesto, Flag, Ideology, Proto-Constitution, Party Organization etc I'm the Chairman and I have a Vice President, Financer etc....</p>
<p>Within the group we certainly have a few who approve of certain aspects of the DPRK, and we've managed to insert some ideas from the DPRK into our group manifesto.</p>
<p>We'll be formalized as a student political group next year and this means we'll be able to participate in Student Representative Debates so it's fair to say that DPRK policies will be discussed and argued next year. (Other Groups included are the Young Greens, Young Communists, Young Social Democrats. Young Monarchists (who we're hoping to join in alliance with) And young Liberals amongst others.</p>
<p>We do have a Chinese exchange student as well who's very sympathetic to the DPRK.</p>
