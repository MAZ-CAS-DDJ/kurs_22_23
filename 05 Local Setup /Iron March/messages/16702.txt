	No sweat I understand your point. There's a Christian fad going on right now. They have to be so vocal and annoying, because fundamentally the two values don't actually fit together. What you're seeing is the raw energy released from water and oil trying to stay together essentially. Any time they bug you just ask a simple loaded question that isn't easy for them to answer. "Are Aryan babies inherently evil?" Is a good example.
