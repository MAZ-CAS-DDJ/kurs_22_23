<p>Yeah, I know what you mean. I thought this board banned Nazism and confined it to the opposition forum. There are a lot of weird people on this site. Like that one half-Vietnamese girl who is a Nazi. On a separate website, she was complaining about how Nazis were "sexualized". Despite having a sexually suggestive icon that flashed with swastikas on it. I don't know why Nazism is still considered a legitimate movement. It's pretty much dead. It cannot be resurrected.</p>
<p>I generally detest antisemitism and racial superiority. I'm not really happy about Israel influencing a lot of our foreign policy in the United States. Yet, that does not translate into anti-Zionism. A lot of these people are not intellectually committed.</p>
<p>Also, I suspect FascistCapitalist is a troll and should be banned for shitposting. I'm surprised the mods have tolerated his behavior for so long. I'm amused by the fact that the administrator who snapped at him today didn't just throw down the b&amp; hammer.</p>
