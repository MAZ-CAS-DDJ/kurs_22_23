<p>Good post you wrote there in that classical fascism thread. I love White Americans but the problem is that most of them are really ignorant about European Catholic movements. They don't realize how these true Christian movements represented the soul of the people but only see them as some offshoots of NS because of their fascination with Hitler. I don't have a problem with American and Germanic NS being pagans or whatever the fuck, but at least they should try to study and understand the culture of non-Germanic Europeans.</p>
