<p>Greetings, Vladimir. I had a question, and I am hoping you could be of assistance. I find activism extremely important, be it real-world or over the internet. As far as real world goes, I have a small group of non-Neo National Socialist's, but actually getting anything done is quite a chore, as only myself and two others take it seriously and do not see themselves as the Fuhrer Reincarnate. As far as internet activism, it is difficult to do anything effectively, anything even worthwhile. Now, a spark of hope has arisen in me at finding Iron March, which is so far a sight for sore eyes amongst Nationalist forums. It has its... annoyances, but it is a far sight better than Stormfront. And to the key question, do you have any advice as to how I can reach a point where I can actually affect anything? A purpose, a goal. I wish, as any good Nationalist should, to do something productive for my cause. I look forward to your response.</p>
<p>With Honour,</p>

<p>Heil</p>
