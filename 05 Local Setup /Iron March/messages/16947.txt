	I thought it was good. But you were right it was somewhat disturbing in places. The seen with the cat kind of got to me (please don't think less me). But I still think Mishima is one hell of a writer if he can evoke such powerful emotions (even if they are discus) in his readers. Still think <em>Patriotism </em>is one of best or maybe the best short novel I have ever read. Too bad we can't find women as devoted as the lieutenant's wife :) But that is a different issue for another time. Also, I am sure between the two of us we can find some pagan or occult ritual to make a deal with the spiders lol.
