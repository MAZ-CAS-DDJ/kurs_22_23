<p>I wanted to ask you about your use of the term "socialist" in your ideology. Paired with "stratocracy", I kind of think you mean Prussian Socialism, but then again that kind of socialism would barely need to be mentioned if you were going with a stratocratic government (why stratocracy, by the way?). So are you a socialist in the sense of a Prussian socialist, a national socialist, or a state socialist?</p>
