	I apologize if I came off as too blunt in my last message - Personally I don't support any Muslim. I feel that groups like Hamas and Hezbollah don't really genuinely care if they get non-Muslim support as long as they are getting weapons or media attention. I saw the video of Falanga in Lebanon or Palestine or whatever Arab country (Can't really remember the specifics) a while ago. Did you go on that trip too?

	I have a deep interest in creating a sort of 'alliance' with you and any members of Falanga that might be able to talk to me. Like being able to relay information and propaganda between Poland and the United States. I will be serving in the military soon, so I want to come out fresh and ready to train my Polish brothers how to defend their blood and soil. I just need to know the ins and outs of laws. I have been in Poland numerous times, but I have not had enough to find the right people to talk to. Ultimately, I want to make friends with similar views as me and my group members, and it seems like Falanga adheres to some of the same things that I too believe in.
