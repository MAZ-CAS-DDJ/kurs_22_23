<p>Glad that you replied,</p>
<p>I totally agree, 'tis a shame that there are no other such sites where people like us could roam.</p>
<p>As William put it:</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="572" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>This site is run by a cabal of immature racists and reactionaries who hide behind the moniker of fascism. Any thought that counters that groups established, often contradictory, beliefs is ostracized and mocked until no one takes them seriously. The site used to be a lot different but is pretty much useless now. They dislike me because of my rejection of race being a matter of importance for a centralized fascist state. The simple fact is that it is not and nowhere in early fascist writings is this even mentioned. They can twist things how they want but they reject the revolutionary wing of fascism if it doesn't still manage to fit into their narrow views. Whatever, I am not concerned about it. It is the reason I am fairly inactive now.<p>They will compromise their beliefs on fascism in favor of race and this place will beocme pointless. Imagine a legitimate conflict where one had to side between State control of a centralized, multi-ethnic populace or a deregulated band of white reactionaries. These people would choose the latter group.</p>

<p>You are much older than anyone on here and actually understand how life works. I wish you best of luck in both personal and political life.</p>
