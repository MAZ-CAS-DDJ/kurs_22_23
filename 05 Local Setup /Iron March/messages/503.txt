<p>Its a poor one at best. Officer's training should be done at a professional academy and through a very wide range of academic, physical and military activities who totally immerse the student for a very long period of time. I'm thinking something like an entire year in total isolation from the civilian world and mostly confined within a company of men, sometimes the battalion. If you like you can compare it to the course at the United States Naval Academy (Annapolis Maryland) except the training would have a much broader volume and density, and of course add in the isolation from all things non-military. but this all isn't exactly relevant to republics and such.</p>

<p>I think that for obvious reasons, that wouldn't happen. This parasite class isn't given any advantages, only more responsibilities- they have no more "rights" than the average citizen, in fact they're supposed to be economically LESS sound, and in fact have weaker finances because of high taxation, unless they are extraordinarily hard workers.</p>
<p>What I think is that you missed the whole point of instituting such a program of citizenship. It isn't to make democracy work and finally realize the long-lost dream of one of your founding fathers, to have a truly egalitarian, functional system of rights or whatever, like the American republic which holds civil rights to the highest mantle of virtue. I don't believe in any of that nonsense.</p>
<p>The goal of this whole thing is to create an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ELITE</span> to <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>GOVERN</strong></span> all society. That this elite is a broad range of average people is a functional reason, that it's much more effective to have a very large pool of decent governors, well integrated and well connected to every single community in the country than it is to have a very high quality but very thin volume elite of governors, ruling in a centralized, autocratic fashion. Giving people some rights that are considered 'democratic' isn't to create a truly democratic system, because that isn't the goal here. The goal is meritocracy and syndicalism, the function of holding votes or polls, and having something of a constitution, principle of citizenship etc, all serves to this end, and to the end of effectively facilitating the integration of all mass energies and indeed, of the entire population into the state. A certain level of autonomy and democracy are necessary for this process because only then will you have a fluid, flexible, self-correcting system.</p>

<p>I'm more a Singapore type.</p>
<p><em>Das Kapital</em> isn't an effective example, because while it is in theory anti-nationalist, it is a critical text to all theory of economics, and a vital historic text at that so I would allow it. What I wouldn't allow is some minor writer or modern writer doing essentially the same thing, say Karl Kautsky or Noam Chomsky. They would be allowed to voice concerns about policy, but any work that undermines or slanders the nation on principle would be deliberately censored. As another example, I would allow works by the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin because while his theory of the state differs from that of the establishment, he was still inherently nationalist.</p>
