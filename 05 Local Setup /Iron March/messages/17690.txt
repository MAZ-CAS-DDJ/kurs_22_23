	Hey twice is better than not at all. I'm going three times a week, typically Mon, Wed and Fri doing 5x5 stronglifts. Fun routine just to get into the gym. Already squatting and deadlifting more than my weight lol. What routine are you doing? Whatever you do, I hope you're doing deadlifts. They're the funnest lift. Just make sure you're doing all your exercises with proper form to avoid injuries.
