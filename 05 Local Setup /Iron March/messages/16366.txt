	I'm 18, so not too older than you. My good friend from Belarus plays in the USPHL. I grew up a little in Massachusetts so I used to be a Bruins fan lol.

	Besides that, I have done a lot of research on Paramilitaries. Poland's new government is offering to fund Paramilitary and Militia organizations with the intent to protect the country. We cant label ourselves as a Fascist or Far-Right group because that would be compromising. I'm working on our connections in Poland. Next year me and the American members are meeting with some of the Polish members in Bieszczady. It'll all come together eventually. We're all willing to put in the work for this. We will be using both Polish and English, and members will be encouraged to learn and study both languages. My mom is the one from Poland, so I was taught when I was younger because I had to attend Polish Saturday school. My father is Irish, but this didn't really prevent me from learning. I lived in Poland when I was younger and I still visit frequently to see family and friends.
