<p>I'm confused about how Iron March uses Skype. Is there an Ironmarch group chat that everyone uses? Can anyone join, or do you have to get invited? Do people just add each other individually? Are there predetermined times people regularly get on, or is it a jump in whenever kind of chat?</p>
<p>I read your banana's adventures or whatever thread, where you trolled that pedo kid, and you seemed like a good person to ask.</p>
