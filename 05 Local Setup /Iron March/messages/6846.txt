<p>The involution of Dugin was pretty much so: National-Bolshevik -&gt; Eurasianist Imperialist with a Russian racial Twist -&gt; Eurasian Imperialist with a Eurasian Orthodox twist -&gt; Grand Master Re-Inventor of Philosophy gibberish wizard fetishistic orthodoxy preacher.</p>

<p>I will leave out Dugin because all he is doing is for personal gain in a very particular light, specifically his 4th political theory crap, which is just him saying that he wants to reinvent philosophy (<em>and the essential basis to a good deal of it is criticism without providing an alternative</em>) - it is full of pointless dribble that is the very definition of what Evola describes philosophers to be and why he hates them. “<em>Let’s discover what is BETWEEN the object and the subject</em>" - that is the New Age equivalent of philosophy and reminds me of that line from a Simpsons episode: "<em>How do numbers make you FEEL?</em>" All he does is beat around the bush, use other people’s concepts and then calls on you to help him redefine philosophy, it is all intellectual prattle of the worst kind that is entirely self-serving. I read that bullshit and have a stack of notes on how its retarded. It is simply a cesspool of pretentiousness.</p>
<p><em>&gt;muh 4th political feel</em></p>
