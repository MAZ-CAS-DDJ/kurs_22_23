<p>You made a good point earlier about needing hipsters who are good with photoshop. It's true we need to break away from this strictly "traditionalist" bullshit which has wore thin and is only attractive to pseudo-intellectual faggots who put those days in which they weren't even apart of on a pedestal and fail to realize that they were not strong enough or uncompromisable and gave way to the mess we have now. We just keep what does work.</p>
<p>I think the futurists had a few good attitudes but the only problem is that the name futurism was given to it, or a name at all.</p>
<p>In Rockwell's day communism was a real threat and the choice was always only ever between fascism and communism; now we are against not so much a threat but a competing ideology of libertarianism which is quite frankly inferior to fascism and is not enough to save our people.</p>
<p>Kevin MacDonald wrote a very good piece on Libertarianism:</p>

<p>It's a bit better than just a hurr-durr "Libertarianism is Jewish" like Dailystormer readers love to proclaim.</p>
<p>My point is many hipsters are libertarians, the rest are liberals and the vocal minority are wannabe Trotskyites. The reason libertarians often win people over from fascism is because many spergs give the impression that fascism would be a nanny state and that there's no personal freedom at all. They also go on and on about their freedom of speech which little do they know most fascists weren't opposed to. Oswald Mosley and Rockwell sure as hell weren't.</p>

<p>There are some fair point sin regards to book burning by the Nazis here as well which can be taken into account:</p>
