<p>Pick one.</p>
<p>So at best Mussolini didn't care enough about race to make a decided opinion on it one way or the other. You don't think it is any coincidence that the only time Italian Fascism concerned itself with race was whne it had the Nazi war machine breathing down its neck? Don't want niggers and arabs in your country? Damn, a great way to do that is to go on imperialist campaigns to expand Italy into...fucking Libya and Ethiopia. Yeah, dat pure Med race.</p>
<p>Hitler was a fucking joke and an insecure art-faggot who happened to paint some nice pictures from time to time. If he wasn't so busy sucking Wagner's dick, maybe he would have been able to pragmatically run his country and not launch Europe into the largest war in history. Ironically, one of the few remarks Mussolini made concerning race regarded the fact that Hitler, being a German, was bound to fuck up fascism. It's amazing how right he was.</p>
<p>&gt;Understands Fascist ideology</p>
<p>&gt;Separatist, de facto White nationalist, reactionary</p>
<p>Again, pick one.</p>
<p>Most of the time I am speaking with Joe and Phil, again, people who actually understand what Fascism means and aren't retards. When you all discuss actual Fascist ideology and not "HURRRR BROWN PEOPLE IN MUH COUNTRY" I'll take you seriously. Otherwise you and the overwhelming majority of people here are a joke to me.</p>
