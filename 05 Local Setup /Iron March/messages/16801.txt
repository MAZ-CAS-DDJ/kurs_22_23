	I like Starwars because it was the only thing that was neat when I was a kid I grew up with the hype around Episode III , when I was in the 5th grade. Mostly because it got me into fascism if I hadn't been into Starwars I probably would never have developed an interest in history or culture anything when I got older. I was always a major fan of the darkside and empire with those fascist aesthetics although when i was younger all I knew was they looked the coolest and were obviously wielding power , much better than the rebels that looked like poverty stricken terrorists.

	Frank re imagines Japanese story telling and is a God , he's powerful as a God, Do you realize that long after the man behind Frank is dead his characters and story will live on eternally , he will become a memetic entity literally with the power of a god.
