	Doing as in work wise? Well I got a job and an apartment lined up already. I have a little bit of family in East Van (Not junkies like most the people there) and I I amean looking at forwarding my welding career with the job position. Alberta has died out for work, and also I just love the mountains, ocean and general environment of BC.Â
