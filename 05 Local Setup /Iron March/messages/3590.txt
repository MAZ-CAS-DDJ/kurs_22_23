<p>23andme, although you should wait until DNA month, where they give the test out for free, you have to pay 9 bucks for 12 months, but that's bullshit as you never need to see any of that stuff for more than a day. When you go to order it when they give it out for free, just get a prepaid credit card with like 20 bucks on it, then when you get your DNA results your not jewed into paying for the full twelve months. I know it sounds cheap, but it's not worth the 300, or even the 108.</p>
