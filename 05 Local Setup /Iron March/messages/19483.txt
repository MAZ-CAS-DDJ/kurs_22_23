	Yeah I don't like the Identitarian crap either tbh but it wasn't my idea, Im just a supporter, not leading it or anything. Regardless, we're already being friendly with groups like Antipodean Resistance and Skydas, as opposed to GI and Vantards so it's going to be obvious where our priorities lie and I have utmost faith in the organiser.
