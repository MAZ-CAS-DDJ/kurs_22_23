	I'm from Connecticut, the topic closed before a reply. To be quite blunt, I live in a town where it's 90% jewish//mongrel so if I were ruler, I'd honestly allow my people to have them sadistically murder the fags and jews mainly, the soul of these individuals are very unsettling and of evil. Also race is very important to a civilization, I strongly believe Hitler was a god of his time and definitely deserves the praise, reading Mein Kampf has really allowed me to dig deeper into the situations in my life that I was being put in, that could have been simply prevented by caring for each other and preserving our race, preserving our culture and the spirit! When you lose your race, you become a product of consumerism. Period. Nothing else.
