	I used to hate gays but I have gay friends and family and just can't waste my time hating gays just because they fuck the same sex. As long as they're not radical and spreading it everywhere (no pun intended) why should I care. Also, I'm Hispanic on both sides and my father married a white woman (shes my stepmom)Â So I would have to disavow my family according to these people.
