	Time in what sense? Basically how it works is we get him an account on NOOSE and he reads articles as they get written to get a feel for the subject matter and makes a graphic for them, either big or small, the size depends on the importance of the subject matter and to keep the front page in variety, so it can't be just 4 small ones in a row, so it becomes a balance of either 1(big) to 1(small), 1 to 2, 1 to 3, 1 to 4. Likewise big ones should never be more than 2 in a row. Once the article is tagged with [final draft] that's when it is ready to be published and thus that's when the graphic should be done, preferably. There's some leeway of a day or two more.

	Some articles we already have a predetermined frame for so he doesn't have to make anything for those, I just need to edit the base since I have it.  Like the anecdotes from sweden series or the fascist workshop series.

	Design-wise you already saw what we're going with, when it comes to particular details about what can be used in the image you'd have to get in contact with the article author so he can supply whatever is needed.

	Also, since we'll be doing a story on Skydas, how about he makes a big poster for that specific article as a try-out? Big posters are 1000x1500px. It can be done in the Skydas style, just has to feature the text "Exclusive <span style="color:rgb(224,224,224);font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:26px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;float:none;">exposé on SKYDAS</span>" and feature the NOOSE logo somewhere on it.

	I'd ideally like to see another cover for the try out where he tries out a different style entirely, closer to the direction we have going now or to the stuff like on the website I linked you to before.
