	Have you been following the forum at all to see our attitude to Trump? Or read the <strong><a href="http://ropeculture.org/2016/02/16/trumpcucks/" rel="external nofollow">Trumpcucks</a></strong> article? Trump is the very thing that prevents some people from going full Fascist because they assume that Trump can be the easier solution. Also are you familiar with the concept of lemmings and why its pointless to appeal to them?
