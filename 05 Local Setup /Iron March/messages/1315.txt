<p>I enjoy several, I am a fan of the original series of Star Trek, Heroes, Torchwood, Transformers and if it counts True Blood. I also enjoy many SF games and films.</p>
<p>Doctor Who is my favourite by far though, even when the show goes through a rough patch, it outpaces the rest of the schedules.</p>
