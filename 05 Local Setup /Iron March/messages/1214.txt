<p>Well there isn't really anybody right now. A year ago I feel absolutely in love with who I thought was the perfect one for me. She couldn't feel the same way and I couldn't take it well. She also turned out to be a gigantic slut, and lied about it, and lied about lying about it. Well after a month of recovery, I was smitten for another lady. She turned me down because she didn't want to date in school-until a week later, when she started a relationship with a freaking ex-marine, saying she had finally found her soulmate.</p>
<p>So I've been in an odd state for almost a year, cursing my loser loneliness, while hardening my heart so as to become dead inside.</p>
