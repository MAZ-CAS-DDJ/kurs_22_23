<p>Yeah, good thing about Personalities threads is they don't have to be too long. Pankhurst &amp; Franklin were both associated with AF &amp; are still revered by the mainstream today for various reasons, which is ironic. De Groot is like an icon of Aussie fascist manliness but he turned away from the New Guard after they became overtly fascist so he might not be the best guy for a thread. I'll give them all a think over the next few weeks. I also might do one on One Nation, even if they are/were kosher, they were still pretty interesting- but that'd require a lot more reading.</p>

<p>As for AF, these are the four books I've found- as far as I can tell they're the most exhaustive look at AF and similar movements from that time. There were actually TONNES of tiny anti-immigrant/pseudo-fash style parties both pre- and post-war, which the last book covers a lot if I remember rightly.</p>

<p>And yeah, sent a PM to Slavros so hopefully that ANM post will be its own thread. I'll write up my quotes tonight &amp; dump them in there. Cheers fellas.</p>
