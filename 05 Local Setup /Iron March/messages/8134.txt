<p>Oh yeah, more reading for you: cheers for your insight on the mining industry, I suspected a lot of miners were quasi-redpilled and it's cool to hear about sentiments from the inside. My brother is a manager in the mining industry &amp; he's racist as fuck, but I wasn't sure how widespread those views are (especially since he's always been that way, lol). Workers have way more potential as recruits than middle-classes in my opinion, bogans (even the ones still doggedly backing the ALP) tend to be way more realistic- hence racist &amp; nationalistic. Problem is we need to appeal to both, which is a fucking tough call as I said before. And cheers also for the fitness advice, I work out a bit but bulking up is something I'll need to get onto, especially if we're gonna be directly confronting Reds &amp; shitskins in the future sometime.</p>
