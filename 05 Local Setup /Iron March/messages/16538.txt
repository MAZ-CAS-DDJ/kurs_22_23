	Sorry for the belated respond. Interesting place, for sure but in my opinion has a bit too much politics in it. Nevertheless, keep up the good job. I am not sure if you are fascist or not so I can't blame you for the lack of such materials but if that helps to open the eyes of atleast 1 person than it did a great job. :)
