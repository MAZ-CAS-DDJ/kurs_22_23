<p>I did have fun in my youth but I wouldn't want to relive it. All that heart break. I've decided I'd like a girlfriend but it's hard meeting the right one. There is a really nice girl in my class but she has a boyfriend. I got pretty depressed when I found that out. lately I've been spending my time on the internet and smoking cigs. I have been doing some work for NBU s well. Handing out leaflets and such. I'm thinking about visiting England. I have plenty of friend to stay with there, I just need the money to get there. </p>
<p>Hey, do you use facebook?</p>
