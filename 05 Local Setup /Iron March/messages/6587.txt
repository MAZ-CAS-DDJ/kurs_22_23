<p>Yea I'm learning it because my wife is a Slav, and our child will be mostly Russian(followed by Irish, French, German, English, Greek/Scottish in that order). So we're going to teach it to our son as a first language. </p>

<p>I can read Cyrillic very slowly and sound like a mongoloid at times trying to read it, but I keep slugging along. Kolovrat has been a big help in pronouncing some things. They have lots of slower songs I can sing along to(or at least parts I can sing along to). I use some Temnozor songs too. </p>

<p>In my spare time I'll play Russian versions of games I played when I was a kid, and that's been a big help as far as confidence goes. </p>
