<p>Yes, you make yourself absolutely clear. </p>
<p>I never intented to use you to help fight my battles for me, I only hoped that you would help give a clearer explanation on what I was trying to say. I was not asking you to agree with me. </p>
<p>As far as using your name, all I said was that I was trying to work with you on cleaning up the forums, as in attempting to contact you, never that you granted me permission to change them or that we were actualy working together. Reguardless, I understand that you do not appreciate your name being used and I'm sorry that I did that without your consent. </p>
<p>Thank you for not having me banned, as I hope to return to these forums at a later time. </p>
<p>Best wishes, Project Atlas</p>
