<p>hello m8,  you are welcome. I was planning on giving an answer to this in the coming weeks (I will be reading from integral europe the book mentioned in the interview - the text that informed my decision). but I can try and answer that the best I can. The simple issue is people have very differing opinions of national socialism, plenty of people out there trying to 'define' it or whatever. it also can't be accurately used with the same generic spread of fascism.</p>

<p>My innitiative that I am trying to set up is based on trying to get people to take a blank slate approach, and because it is reinventing the wheel so to speak, Integralism works better to my thinking - and it is sincere to differenciate that from national socialism as the latter has historical reconception. I guess you maybe looked it up in wikipedia - the result is vague and historical, it is basically a place holder for fascism, anything proto-fascist is called integralist; Maurras, the sorellians, etc. Reinventing the wheel requires lateral thinking, broad open mind - take my support for social credit and the RPN innitative for instance. I take this so I can own this concept and not have to deal with historical semiotics as much.</p>
