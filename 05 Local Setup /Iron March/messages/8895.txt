<p>That's another great Order song. You can fine the lyrics here: <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Immortal_Pride/proPAGANda/297254" rel="external nofollow">http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Immortal_Pride/proPAGANda/297254</a></p>

<p>I'm doing good. About to finish my first semester with A's and B's. So I can't complain about that. My son is growing big. He's 9 and half months and he's in 24 month stuff. So if this keeps up he's going to be a big half-Slav. He looks pretty Slavic too. All he gets from my are my Greek eyes and my ears. Everything else he seems to get from his mom's side. </p>

<p>You're no longer in NYC iirc, right?  Must be nice not having to see nogs much. </p>
