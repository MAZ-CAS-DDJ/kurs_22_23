	So I found out to get rid of the tumor they are going to do surgery from the front. So they are going to crack my chest open. So that means recovery is going to be a lot longer. So that sucks. Other than that shit's looking good.

	Found out I'm going to have a daughter today. So I'm excited/nervous I understand boys. You draw a line deep enough in the sand they'll listen. Girls on the other hand...<br /><br />
	You'd like it up here in NH. Lots of white women up here. Almost no niggers or spics. We have a heroin problem, but that's everywhere now. There's a good sized Slavic diaspora as well. <br /><br />
	So you've lost your sausage beauty? Maybe you should find yourself an Irish or Greek girl. There's a good diaspora there. The Irish hate niggers and from what I hear the Greek diaspora loves the Golden Dawn.

	I've been loving this election. It's polarizing everything. It's making clearly defined lines where moderates are getting push aside left and right. My only concern is Trump losing the nomination. I know he can beat Hilary, but that bird faced fuck Cruz has no chance in hell.
