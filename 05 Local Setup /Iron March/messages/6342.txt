<p>Can upload huge files and archives. Someone upped a load of chemistry stuff for me the other day, over 600mb worth and the most important thing is it downloaded quickly. It's my new uploading site. Uploaded and audio book of Plato's Republic there today.</p>
<p>It's not as delicate as hidemyass or anonfiles is. I'd still use a proxy if I was uploading explosive making shit or anything like that though.</p>
