	Hi there,
</p>

<p>
	I noticed your introduction thread, and I just wanted to say it's always great to see more Americans on IM. I see you're from Pennsylvania and have been involved in a few organizations in the past. Me and a few other east coast Americans are currently trying to grow a fascist group. We have a member in Pennsylvania and several more in New England as well. If you'd be interested in more information or perhaps talking about joining, feel free to hit me up.Â <br />
	Best,
