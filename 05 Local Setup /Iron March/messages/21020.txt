	Hey, Slavros.

	You know, I'm still a young guy and because I live in leafland there aren't a lot opportunities for someone like me to actually get involved in any form of group and get boots on the ground so I wanted to ask you what <u>your</u> opinion is on the Daily Stormer and their bookclubs.

	I've been getting into contact with my local one recently and I know I've heard you on Mysterium a handful of times now so I gotta assume you don't have a 100% negative opinion about the Stormer. Thanks in advance.
