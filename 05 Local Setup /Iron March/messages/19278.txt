	Those are all valid points, but we can't ignore where we stand right now; so while it is true that we can not compromise on our ideals, we have no choice but to compromise on our methods leading to the realization of the aforementioned ideals (think of the symbols of Sun and Earth in this regard). Our community works the same and it couldn't work in any other way since all of us are flawed.

	Slavros didn't establish this stuff by himself but by following the teachings of Guénon and Evola, at least that's what he said - but maybe you know more than me about this if you have read his notes.

	I had the same <em>feeling</em> though I wasn't able to prove him wrong. That's what he said exactly:
</p>

<p>
	"When it's temporal it has to be tied down to its respective race/civilization/culture/ethnicity."
</p>

<p>
	I can't really argue with this except if we presuppose that Modernism will triumph in the future, because then there will be no more races, civilizations, cultures or ethnicities to begin with, only a mass of manimals. On the other hand, this is not about that we want to limit the Avatar, but we have no choice for our understanding itself is limited.

	You are of course right about that the top of the pyramid bears a higher (and in this case the only) existence, the absolute Unity, but that also means that even the level directly below it will consist more than one element, and it looks like that according to this it would be correct to say that until the end of time the world won't be united under a single leader. That's the goal, but it is beyond time and life.

<p>
	What do you mean? The Material will dissolve into God, not the other way around.

<p>
	I agree with your final conclusion.
