EU rules on fruit &amp; veg shapes and dimensions are ridiculous. Odd though how they want as mixed a society for humans as they deem feasible and yet fruit &amp; veggie must be structured and graded. Frankly, it should be the other damned way around!</p>

Current economic practice stinks. Invariably done for the Jew and the Capitalist. I want to agree with you about the complex volatility of products such as derivatives but lessons were not learned as a result of the turmoil of 2008 and early 2009. Actually, I stand corrected...the money grubbers have learned how to be more secretive and cautious since. I sadly do not think most people have woken up to the problem, except in some locations such as Greece &amp; Italy. Golden Dawn is acting remarkably in Greece and I wish theme success. Meanwhile, in Italy, they do appear to be re-grouping and, I agree, things will probably need to get noticeably worse for our cause to flourish as more persons recognize that democracy is a dead-end.</p>
