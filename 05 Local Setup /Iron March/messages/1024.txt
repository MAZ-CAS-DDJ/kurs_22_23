<p>Doesn't surprise me one bit. These children just sit around all day reading Evola or whatever other "philosophers" they wish they were, while dressed in black and listening to freaky deaky music. I'd be surprised if any of them even had jobs, The reason so many of them are all for redistributing property and wealth is probably because most of them already are parasites.  Sure they like to talk big and criticize those people who are actually out there doing something about the Marxist scum, but its easy to do that typing behind a key board. Truth is they admire the Marxists more then they oppose them and thats why they do have the sense of urgency that fellers like you and me do.</p>
