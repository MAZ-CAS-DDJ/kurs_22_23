<p>I don't think so. But I am a sentimental stubborn bitch, so what do I know!</p>
<p>I saw a family once at my sister's cello concert, they seemed so perfect to me. The dad had his arm around the mother in a protective way, the daughter was lying on their lap. All I know about them was that their son was called Luka, and I still like the name.</p>
<p>When it started going bad, he would tell me he wished I was pregnant so he'd have a reason to stay. We always talked about a family. I know I should stop thinking/caring so much, but it's harder than I thought. You already know. You know, if two trees grow so close for a while, they grow around each other. It's like a massive missing space in your self, your future too.</p>
<p>Forest is good, I like it.</p>
