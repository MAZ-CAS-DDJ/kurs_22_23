	Yea man I know how you feel, My lurking on heres taken a hit from Work and just the job Situation at the Moment.Â <br />
	I heard from the head of the EYL and he just said that he doesnt have anyone he can trust in Hobart and the EYL is too small at the moment. But idk if youve seen it posted about on here at all, Theres a new group being Started up in Aus meant to be like National Action called the Antipodean Resistance. Due to the fact that ive been looking for a <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> like group in Aus for ages, im keen to get involved once I have the ability to, and if youd like I can put you in contact with one of their members
