<p>It's good if you have some basic knowledge of Spanish grammar, because declensions and this "agreement rule" where adjective should be put in the same gender and case as the noun they describe is the same in Spanish and in Croatian. It's like this in most of European languages.</p>

<p>It's really wonderfull if you plan to learn it, it's a cool language that will open you to an entire new culture. Remember that Croatian is basically the same as Serbian (and "Bosnian"), if you understand one language you will understand another too. So if you'll learn Croatian you'll speak the language of Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. Those countries have specific culture and there's so much you'll be able to enjoy, from music to Balkanic humour, as well as reading "Slav fights" in their language. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> It's one of the most interesting and specific cultural areas of Europe with really rich history. It's one of the least Americanized parts of Europe as far as popular culture is concerned. Even here in Slovenia we listen to Croatian and Serbian music all the time because there's so much good stuff. Me and my friends always use Serbian and Croat phrases.</p>

<p>Also, all Slavic languages are really similar, it will be a good foundation if you'll ever plan to learn another Slavic language (say Russian).</p>

<p>I already wrote once on this forum, it's not hard to learn a language if you really want to. I'm willing to help you and I can help you a lot because I have good understanding of grammar concepts and terminology from learning Latin extensively, so I think I can explain you the grammatical part of the language. And obviously because I'm fluent in Croat, even though it's not my mother language. I just hope you're motivated enough.</p>

<p>It's pleasure to help you because people who share our beliefs should help each other and because learning languages is one of the most important part of real education, too often neglected today.</p>

<p>As for post 1918 on, I really don't know how much knowledge of Croat history you have at the moment, but I can give you a "lecture" so to speak, explain you what you want to know. I'm a history student and modern Central European is my expertise.</p>

<p>Where you want to raise your family is your decision, but I'd suggest you to visit Croatia and see how things are there for yourself. It's one of the top destinations for tourists in Europe anyway, the Croatian seaside is very popular, you probably know about that. Zagreb is cool too, a typical Habsburg Central European city. We used to go to Croat seaside every year when I was younger. Just few days ago I found pictures of me, my father, my boxing coach (who is also a good family friend) and his daughter when we were on a vacation on island of Cres together in 2000, I was 11 back then.

<p>Btw, do you know Croatian singer Thompson? He's a cult figure, extreme controversial nationalist pro-Catholic, pro-Ustaša (implicitely) singer who managed to become a big mainstream pop star. Leftists are butthurt because he's extremely popular, especially among youth. Here's one of his<a href="http://youtu.be/EELj_0nXy5w" rel="external nofollow"> best songs (with English subtitles)</a>, you can find more on related videos  .</p>
