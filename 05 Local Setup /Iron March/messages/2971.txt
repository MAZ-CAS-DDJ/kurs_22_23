<p>Me, I go by the verse in Pirkey Avos: "He who has interpreted a verse literally, has committed a fraud." The Torah was made to be interpreted, and we Jews must always do our best to adapt our religion to the current climate-- Torah Im Derech Eretz-- while staying true to our original principles of ethical monotheism.</p>
<p>I think the Zohar and the Kabbla are quite interesting, and I do believe there are seventy facets to the Torah, and the Gemmatria, and all that. I'm quite a traditional Jew, but I don't brook literalism-- I find it ridiculous to say "remember Shabbos" when you have never defined what Shabbos is, or what it means to remember Shabbos. Does it mean you just take a break from your video gaming every Saturday to say "well, it's Shabbos today" or conciously try to bring HaShem into your day? I believe that we Jews should bring a sense of holiness to all we do-- as HaShem dwells in the ordinary as well as the extraordinary.</p>
<p>So there's your answer. I accept all of Judiasm, even Sephardim (that was a joke) though I fin Reform and Reconstructionism a little hard to swallow. Jews should stay traditional, in my opinion-- it's what's kept us alive so long.</p>
