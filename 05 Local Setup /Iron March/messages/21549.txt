	I found another good German work that is highly requested for translating. Karl August Eckhardt - 'Irdische Unsterblichkeit' (Earth, Immortality, Reincarnation and the Clan) which I have as pdf: <a href="https://mega.nz/#!ZKojmQRY!A4tXdrAJfhSdeN1CMwQL7WxClkPPeZ6J1bS1hPS9fkg" rel="external nofollow">https://mega.nz/#!ZKojmQRY!A4tXdrAJfhSdeN1CMwQL7WxClkPPeZ6J1bS1hPS9fkg</a>

	Everything going well?
