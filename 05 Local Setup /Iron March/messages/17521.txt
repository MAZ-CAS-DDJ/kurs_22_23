	Allegiances or source of income represents the commitment to truth or justice. Just as police protect their monopoly on violence, a hired gun would protect his right to exercise violence for money but be amenable to shifting alliances and circumstances. A fascist would reject both stances as neither owes their allegiance to righting wrongs. Even if police may believe they are while serving a false belief system predicated on using a monopoly on violence for maintaining it, or when the hired gun believes he's serving the only thing that matters. The fascist has the courage to respect and reclaim truth through action, to live it. Direct action is not as valued because it does not require "the people" to support what is being revealed or proposed, politics isn't valued unless its used as means to an end &amp; democracy is not valued because its designed to keep out the real right.

			By not removing the porn addicted paedophile from your organisation you're showing your true colours - you have the same mentality as every other alt-right faggot: "Sure he fantasises about raping little boys, but he writes some really good articles. What are you doing for the movement?" (re Grinder Greg). This kind of realpolitik mentality will never get you anywhere because: a) you will never enact your principles due to compromising with people who have none. Or b) you have none yourself. You may as well go back to shitposting on the TRS forum about ovens and Donald Trump in between hentai fap sessions and tendies, because unless you're willing to live by your principles and make them a living faith that binds you (which means getting your subordinates to not watch anime porn, not just yourself), you will never accomplish anything.

	<span>I agree. They still have Greg Johnson homo as one of guys leading it &amp; some even still defend (((Mike))), though I have faith that  the Alt-right will socially segregate as they did with Alt-light. As a decentralized movement, they have the effectiveness of terrorists but with ideas even there is that problem of anonymity and anyone identifying as one eg hypocrites, self-appointed leaders acting as gatekeepers, infiltrators &amp; (((parasites))) etc. Surely they do not do it or themselves justice by their actions, and they leave democracy alone usually from their topics of discussion or principles, and focus on globalism under capitalism. Then theres the lack of ideology and spirituality, though they are forming political stances.</span>

	<span>"..we are allowed to be a creative force for what is the true essence of our struggle - Truth. As much as we can restore some of the past and give it new life, we can also tear it down and mold something new in the temporal sense of the word. Futurism is not an exclusively American option, it is simply easier applied there as the US never had anything in its foundation and at no point manifested even for a moment that Truth." ~Next Leap, pg.92.</span>

	<span>This is how I feel about whats been happening with the convergence of several social groups in the US, the idea is to create something new &amp; selectively take from the past.</span>
