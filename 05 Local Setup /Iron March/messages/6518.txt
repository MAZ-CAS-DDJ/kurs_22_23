<p>I'm not sure if you know this, but many Orthodox Christians consider King Harold Godwinson of England a Saint, and that England pre-1066 was the last Western Orthodox Christian Nation. King Harold's daughter fled to Russia and married a Prince there, and the 'Varangian Guard' of the East Roman Empire was after 1066 composed of Anglo-Saxon Orthodox men who fled England from Norman/Papist tyranny. Anyway, like much of what you have to say.</p>
