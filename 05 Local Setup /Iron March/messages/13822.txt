	I totally understand... that is fucked that someone who was so close with the movement just up and fucking left. Like what kind of nerve... and betrayal. I completely understand that my IP address raises a red flag but I really am just home for a few days visiting family (I haven't seen my father in over 6 months which is why I'm home) but I will be in Boston on Monday and assure you that I primarily live there.
