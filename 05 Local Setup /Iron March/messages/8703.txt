<p>Blur more. You can't be too careful with these things. Plus like I said, it's important that anybody watching is confident that we'd take <em>their </em>anonymity seriously if they got involved. I've seen one video from Misanthropic Division England - where he was sparring with one of his lads in his gym. Not seen any more (if there are more?) Anyway, blurry faces doesn't detract from the aesthetic. It adds to it IMO.</p>
