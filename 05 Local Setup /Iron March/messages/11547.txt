<p>You can make a fair amount of content with a pack of sticker paper and black/white ink at home, if you get some ideas for propaganda, download the Phonto app on your phone and google search for vector and transparent images, easy to knock something up in a few minutes, pic collage app is also good for posters, I know it's not much but showing the system there is resistance to them and with all the latest triggering in the media by well placed stickers, it's not all worthless.</p>
