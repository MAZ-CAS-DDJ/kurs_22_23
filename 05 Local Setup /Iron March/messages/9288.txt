<p>Yeah my maternal Grandfather had the same failing, although once he got sick that calmed him down a lot an he tried to make amends. Sorry to hear thats not the case with you,  I don't blame her for how she feels or wanting to leave.</p>
<p>Obviously i don't know anything about them, or the situation, but I can't comprehend habitually beating someone you claim to love.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sometimes my mother would get violent with my father, never anything serious, but not through lack of passion. They split up periodically when i was growing up, for months at a time. 4 times from what i remmember, when she died they were split up but seemed to be working thing out idk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thinking back on it, im pretty sure my mother cheated on him when they split up, never saw anything of the sort with my dad, can't say for 100% certainty, but i think he was always faithful.</p>

<p>I'm how old my profile says, 21, though i'll be 22 on the 31st. Like i said, it's not recent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every once and a while i'll talk to her, usually it's to apoligize or update.</p>
