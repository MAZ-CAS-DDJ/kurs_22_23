<p>I used to go running barefoot uphill with a backpack full of rocks! High five!</p>
<p>Riley was sitting in my lap today when he just reached over and GRABBED MY CHEST and said, what's that? Oh my goodness. I just about died. "That is my boob, Riley, please let go now. We don't grab people there, it's not polite." And my coworker was just sitting there choking back laughter omg</p>
