<p>Haha nahh he's alive and kicking, hopefully willing to catch up sometime and have some fun, sorry lads were supposed to head over east but a women came an threw a spanner in the works and heading over to england/canada for Chrissy/NY, going to try Catch up with some shitlords from here If I can. </p>
<p>Tried using photoshop and I don't have a clue where to start....phones just quick and easy. </p>
<p>Where I live ppl wouldn't bother trying to rip a sticker down, Albany is all fucking boomers and oldies. I don't know if they'd even take the bloody time to read them, I'll put some of those latest ones I made up when I get back from work see if I can trigger some shitcunts but spreading this stuff is sort of more relevant in the cities where the hordes of shitskins are concentrated...</p>
<p>Only thing that was torn down were A3 posters on the main street during Anzac Day parade, they weren't sufficiently glued on either... the advantage of using sticker paper is that by yourself you can plaster it and to keep it, spray over it with gloss acrylic sealer, which you can get from bunnings, you could only remove it strait away but once the sealer sets it's like concrete, spread them during the day and seal them at night as spraying shit is obviously going to seem like vandalism in daylight....if I was at uni I'd just deface the posters with a sticker over the top, every time they put them back up...repeat but I don't know what aussie unis are like, they are expensive as fuck so id imagine you'd wanna be pretty stealthy to avoid getting kicked out...</p>
