<p>Alright I have a few questions<br /><br />What is the tempel ov blood and is it affiliated with the o9a weltanschauung?<br />Also why is qabballah viewed in such a negative light, If it is a age old tradition that has been corrupted in a magian way is there not a way to ressurect it?</p>
<p>Is someone who follows the O9A Seven Fold Way encouraged to partake in their own ritual and ceremonial magick?</p>
