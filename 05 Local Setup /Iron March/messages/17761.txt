	Now it's my turn to apologize for the late response. I started to write this letter weeks ago, but I just got overloaded with my projects. After I send you this message I have to write an article for one of my friends and I still have tons of pictures and texts to work on, not to mention the IRL stuff... ah, bitching is over. It was nice to hear from you again!

	I haven't heard about Yalda before, but it looks interesting. There is a book from Hafez in Hungarian, and since it's always good to read from a Mystic, especially if he is called the <em>Interpreter of Secrets</em>, I will put it on my list. What is your stance on him? (It looks like you have both Christian and Muslim layers on top of the original Yalda, SO WHO'S THE CUCK NOW!?)

	I can be wrong about this, but according to my understanding we have all three of those qualities in us, only different amounts of them, so the question is that which one is the dominant. Hitler was often talking about Divine Providence and Truth, but you are right about that He was more likely a Man Against Time. I wouldn't say though that there wasn't any Man Above Time in that era. Maybe not pure ones, but Ungern Khan and Codreanu were both led by those qualities in the sense that they both threw away their lives in order to fully become the instruments of God's will. Hitler made the same decision when He killed Himself; and at that moment He died together with every worldly thing He fought for, with the National Socialist German Empire, and thus became something more, a Legend. If you study their lives and deaths you will see that they all had a mysterious atmosphere around them, which effects us even today, even if we are only talking about them. I still have to read <em>'The Sun and the Lightning'</em> by Savitri Devi; but Evola for example was surely a man who should have gotten more attention and power at that time.

<p>
	Free will is an important part of Christianity and my faith too, and it works together with my former statements above in a synthesis. I spent a half day for searching after a video on the subject, but I didn't manage to find it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx8ZMkWL8hw" rel="external nofollow">here's another one</a> close enough). The Divine Plan works like the organic state: if the state needs architects then instead of forcing random people to become ones (as the mechanistic Communism did), it creates an environment where those who are having the required skills can realize their potentials by their own free will. It's the same with love - there is nobody waiting for you 'somewhere out there' as the romantic daydreamers are imagining, but there are millions of potential future gurlfriendz, and it is you who have to create the right conditions for them in order to realize those potentials. In a sense you are making them but at the same time they are acting by their free will.

	First I wanted to answer this question, but - <strong>PLOT TWIST</strong> - I think I will test you instead. So, when we are talking about Truth and falsehood, we are seeing a duality, and to a point this view can be justified - you are right about that there is no third way here, as something between Truth and falsehood would be still false.

	It seems like you got the idea, but as we know, the use of words has a great importance since fuckin' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpuwbyM5BKc" rel="external nofollow">Babel's Tower</a>, so I did look up my old notes again (lol; we have written down the words in romanized Arabic too):
</p>

<p>
	Body (al-jism): obviously the realm of our physical, vegetal and animal aspects; thus the instincts, material needs, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Soul (al-nafs): they are usually associating it with emotions. That's correct, but intelligence and thus rationality are also parts of the soul, as well as the sense.
</p>

<p>
	Spirit (al-rūḥ): as both Guénon and Coomaraswamy stresses, we can talk about our own bodies and souls, but we can't talk about "our own spirits", for Spirit is One as it is beyond individuality. There is however something between It and the soul, and that is intellect, what is something above comprehension; intuitions are received through it.
</p>

<p>
	So the hierarchy looks something like this:
</p>

<p>
	Spirit &gt; intellect (intuitions) &gt; sense &gt; intelligence (reason &amp; other abstractions) &gt; emotions &gt; instincts &gt; sustainment

			The thing is, if you're at the top of the mountain, you would already know of everything that's below you, and you would also know of the experiences that led you to that top. What you're saying here is like saying that we (us fascists) can just fly to the top while the plebs walk up there. But I'd say: we're the ones actually climbing to the top, while the plebs don't even bother or care about doing so in the first place. Isn't that what's happening here?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You are right about that while we are climbing the mountain, the plebs are either wandering without directions or not moving at all; but for reaching the top, you don't need to go through every path, only one (quality contra quantity). After all, you don't want the mountain itself, but overcome it. If you wake up from a dream it becomes clear that the details of the dream are completely irrelevant compared to the fact that you are awake now thus you are in a world much closer to Truth. That's the difference between Transcendence and Occultism - if you reach the top of the mountain, you will be able to either reign over it and do anything you want with it, or transcend it by going beyond its peak. The question is if you want to control your dreams or weak up? That's what the Temptation of Christ is about. I respect Occultism since it also seeks how to get to the top, but as soon as it arrives it becomes - even if the most noble form of that sin, but still - idolatry.
</p>

<p>
	On the top, you will be able to experience everything below you, but exactly because of that, if you can't leave the whole mountain through Ascension, the only thing you will be left with is Involution; the <em>"free choice"</em> between <a href="https://i.imgur.com/d2zqOxS.png" rel="external nofollow">countless ways to descend</a> into the lower territories.

	Meister Eckhart said that first you have to empty yourself if you want to accept God - but of course, you can't force Him, and in the end what happens is fully depends on His Will. Eckhart's perspective is one way to see it, you can also say that you have to prepare yourself, become stronger, wiser, etc., the point is that there is a war going on between your person (body and soul) and the Self (Spirit). Whenever we give up on the trifles we want as humans, by sacrificing them to serve something greater we get more closer to the Self. Hitler has sacrificed himself, long before that afternoon on the 30th of April, 1945.

			And by the way, in this trinitarian duality, would intuition be solar or lunar? Between intuition vs hard work, which would be solar and which would be lunar?

<p>
	I don't know the answer for that. Personally I would support the establishing of one or more fully isolated and self-sustaining communities (with initiation centers as their cores) in which we would have much better chances to protect our traditions and bloodlines than in the society we are living in now. Think of it as both figurative and literal bunkers or fortifications in our eternal struggle, like the Catacombs of the early Christians hidden below the decadent Roman Empire.
</p>

<p>
	I read somewhere that there is a disagreement within the Alchemists over the hierarchy of the four elements: some says Air is on the top, others are saying it is Fire (I tend to support the latter); but everybody agrees on that those two are above Water, which is above Earth. If we compare the four elements to the four ages, we could argue that now it is the Earth which dominates over the other elements, thus that's what we should primarily operate with. Take the symbolism of the mountains (or Pyramids); the traditional (Valley of the Kings, or Naqsh-e Rustam if we want something more closer to your people) and not so traditional (nuclear bunkers of the Cold War) examples of history, the badass Kurdish saying and Revelation 6:12-17 from the Bible and you will get the idea what I am talking about.
</p>

<p>
	Fascist in essence are Men Against Time, right. We can became Men Above Time only after we won our eternal struggle, which means that as long as we are locked in Time we will always fail. Our struggle is eternal exactly because it lasts <em>until the end of Time;</em> and yes, the outside world is hopeless exactly because it is outside.

<p>
	Yes, that's why I still can't drop the idea of 'Integralism' in the sense that we will never be able to turn everybody into Fascists, but maybe we will be able to build them into the structure of the Fascist society. For this we need one-way connections, just as it was in the Traditional societies: since the king was following God, the nobles were following the king, and the plebs were following the nobles, everybody was following God only on different levels of directness. Corruption changes the way of these connections so it is no more the superior what influences the inferior, but the other way around. Our task is to contain Chaos within Order, and slowly assimilate it. Today the opposite is happening, and if there is no more chance for us to change the direction of the influences running through those connections, we have no choice but to cut them - so it's either Integralism or Isolation, but it is indisputable that the realization of the former is becoming more and more close to the impossible.

	The North/Eastern position and the South/Western orientation is the geopolitical manifestation of the same <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/7141-black-fascist/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=172050" rel="">hierarchy</a> I mentioned above, as the Borean races came from North-East and conquered the Tropical ones on the South-West. This nexus was also corrupted, that's why today it is the <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2015/10/negrified-america/" rel="external nofollow">Tropical influences which are affecting the Boreans</a>. In this model we regard the Equator as the ultimate South, and both poles as ultimate North, as if those were but the mirror images of each other with the same principles - since their core, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_mundi" rel="external nofollow">Axis mundi</a> is the same (remember Neuschwabenland), while the Equator is the farthest you can be from the Earth's axis. To see the one-dimensional North and South as symbols of the three-dimensional high and low is obvious, but Baranyi said that we can also regard East and West as an extension of this symbolism to the two dimensional realm, for East is related to the beginning while West is related to the end. The Ancient Egyptians had a great symbol for this and the yugas at the same time: the Sun God Ra was constantly traveling around the world (cyclic aspect) with two boats: on Mandjet (Opus Album) He traveled through the sky, from sunrise to sunset, then He boarded Mesektet (Opus Nigrum) to continued His journey through the underworld. Are you familiar with Makinder's <a href="http://www.ca-c.org/journal/2005/journal_eng/cac-04/Image44.jpg" rel="external nofollow">Heartland</a> theory by the way?
</p>

<p>
	According to all of this it is not a surprise that the average Kurd is in a much better shape than us, while we (as Eastern Europeans) are in a much better shape than the average Westerner. It is not because of Communism, but despite of it; all you have to do is to compare Eastern Communism with the Western one. The corruption still threatens though, and just as Europe conquered America only to be conquered by it later, I fear that Islam tries to conquer that Modernist Europe it will end up conquered by instead. I have just seen a <a href="https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/joanna-palani-syria-iraq-ran-away-fight-isis" rel="external nofollow">story of a Kurd girl fighting against ISIS</a>, and even if I don't want to see your people ending up like her, that's the way history is heading. Don't misunderstand me, I am amazed by her courage and commitment, but it is clear that she is already a Western woman (the last paragraph of the article is just pathetic). The Middle East was in a relatively good state up until the Murricans started to destroy the remaining pre-Modern societies, but I am sure you already know that story.

			By the way, this just reminded me of something: what do you think about the various esoteric ideas about the ancient Aryans having the abilities of flight and telekinesis and living for thousands of years and all that stuff? How much worth do these theories have from your perspective?

	Hard to tell for it is true that the longer lifetime is frequently occurring in Traditional sources, but it is also possible that this had a more symbolic meaning. I remember when Baranyi funnily quoted one of these texts showing us how worried they were about the tragic nature of the Iron Age for in this era the humans have lost their ability to live longer than <em>a millennium</em>. Today it is common that people feel like they are stagnating and time flows out of their hands, so one can argue that the ancient ones maybe lived just as long as we do, but their life was much more intense. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/CzDPBVa.png" rel="external nofollow">Futurism follows this second interpretation</a>, and it's a good thing that IronMarch has embraced it; but honestly I don't have the knowledge to answer this question of yours.

			Isn't this what the whole issue of Men Above Time boils down to? I imagine that a monastic type of order, led by the likes of Evola, would be the perfect thing that fascism needs but so far lacks. I don't think it would be the only component of such an Organic State, but rather a part of it, interweaved with the other parts just like the SS and the Wehrmacht and everything else that was interweaved within the larger structure of Nazi Germany.

			That is my dream too, man. And we're actually planning to build such places in Kurdistan.

	Sadly yes. Whatever we do we have to find a place which the outsiders don't know/care about, or at least it is hard to reach. I have searched for ruins in Transylvania but most of them are close to roads and well-known by tourists. Well, I guess that these are some of the rare things you cannot find on the internet: places which are unknown to the public (Thank you Captain Obvious!). I really should start traveling and see those areas myself, but I don't have the money yet.

	I don't agree. Remember, as above, so below; God is One, just as His Creation we are experiencing around us. Nations are legitimate units within this system, but just as long as they are serving a cause greater than themselves. If a cell won't work within an organ; if an organ won't work within a person; if a person won't work within a family; if a family won't work within a people; if a people won't work within a nation they will all lose their essence, even if their motivation to preserve themselves is basically right. The same goes for the nations, and Nationalism can be corrupted too if it becomes the ultimate goal of itself. War is also an important part of this world, so I don't talk about some Utopia: think of two gears working together. If you focus on them you will see an unsolvable contrary as their rotation is antithetical, but as you move away from them it will become clear that what looks like an antagonism on their level is in fact a function, hidden from them but obvious from a higher level. True friends and allies are seeing their relationship from this higher perspective, that's why their interests cannot contradict each other, even if it can look like that from a lower level:

			The legionary movement is based exclusively neither on the principle of authority nor on that of liberty. It has its foundations rooted in the principle of love. In it, both authority and freedom have their roots. Love is the peace between the two principles: authority and liberty. Love is in the middle, between them and above them, embracing both of them in everything they have best and removing the conflicts between them.

	Because of that, I can admire all of the ideal nations, while at the same time despise all of the actual ones. It is not this or that nation which is problematic, but a hidden influence which tries to take away their essence, rendering both war and peace meaningless thenceforth. This hidden influence can be called hate, and its position is the opposite of that of love, it is between and under the two principles of authority and freedom.

	If the Persians are becoming degenerate that's bad news for you too for it will be a triumph of weakness. If you would go into a war against Iran you would end up with a weakening region between the Arabs, the Turks, the Russians and the Indians. Maybe you would be able to unite the Kurds, but only to fall under the influence of another power. Szálasi was also warned us about this: if any of the Fascist/Nationalist states are supporting the anti-Fascist/anti-Nationalist movements of other states only to weaken them, it will lead to the global victory of weakness for everybody will do the same. The real warrior wants to defeat strong enemies, the real leader wants to rule over noble people.

	Yes, and the guys are also constantly cursing him quite rightfully, but I still see something in him. <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/7382-bannon-cited-italian-thinker-who-inspired-fascists/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=177629" rel="">Evola also criticized Fascism</a> 'from the Right', and first I thought that Dugin is doing the same, thus his Fourth Political Theory will be a form of Fascism what is on one hand, even more Fascist on the inside than the historical examples, but on the other hand more compromising on the outside in the Integralist sense, which is also something what could have saved Fascism back then (<a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/837-national-revolutionary-movement-in-the-weimar/" rel="">see the National Revolutionaries</a>). That's probably too great to be real, but if you read <a href="http://4pt.su/en/content/traps-and-dead-ends-new-nationalism" rel="external nofollow">this article by him</a> you will see that when he criticizes Nationalism (3PT) he identifies it with the modern, negative aspect what I call Chauvinism; while supporting its positive forms, and that's fine, moreover, needed within our circles.
