<p>Not sure about Racist, Palmer seems determined to enlist in the USMC.<br /><br />To be honest I'm struggling with the issue right now; don't really want to become an officer unless I go National Guard, so I'm thinking of Army or Marine reserves, enlisted. Might go after a job in public safety for my primary income.<br /><br />Everything I've been hearing from retired and active soldiers is that the government is gutting their benefits and pushing more PC crap down the chain of command. We fascists need to be ready to act when the time comes, and my fear is going active could tie me down too much for the next couple years, when making a lot of money and networking is more crucial. Unless the system collapses we're going to need financial backers, so those capable of doing so should seek out professions that pay better and let them put aside or invest money.<br /><br />Of course there will be nationalists in the military, so that's a good thing.</p>
