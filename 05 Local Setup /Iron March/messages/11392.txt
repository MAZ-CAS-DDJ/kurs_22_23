<p> </p>
<p>I drove a car didn't get my license til I was 19 crashed my car totaled it ,  later i only drive to the grocery store now I have a phobia of driving , i did before I learned to drive and while I drove.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the only job I ever had was about a month two years ago during summer I worked at IHOP as a busboy, I hated it it was disgusting gross and demeaning i quit because I had gotten away with not cleaning the toilets then one day they were gonna make me go and do it over. I just couldn't do that to myself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I feel like there's a lot more people out there like us that have no where to go.</p>
