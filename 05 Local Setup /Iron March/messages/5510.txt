<p>I was not raised Orthodox. I came on my accord. Orthodoxy is complicated because it recognizes the mystery behind faith, you ask an Orthodox priest a question and you'll get, "both-and, it's a mystery" because humans cannot fully comprehend the Lord or his ways. Orthodoxy is very good a knocking you down a few pegs, it's highly mystical and mysterious and takes a lifetime to unravel. Do you have any questions about Orthodoxy?</p>
