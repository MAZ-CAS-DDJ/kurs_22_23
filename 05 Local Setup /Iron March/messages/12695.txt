<p>I know enough about Norse mythology to know that Loki copulated with and birthed a horse, so there's probably something equally strange floating around Germanic myth. I get what you're saying, but your statement also leaves me wondering what the truth in THAT one is. In my experience, the Hillary voters are the old guard democrats, whereas the Bernie voters are young and open socialists. What do you think? I like hiking, am thinking about taking up flamenco (because compared to my mother's side, I'm the gringa who can't dance), and used to ice skate. You keen on any of that stuff? Not to be mean, but really can't imagine you doing flamenco.</p>
<p>I love how we've reached the stage where we think traditions and societal mores only apply to us if we want them to. Britain's so cucked that the only people I know who remotely agree with my nationalism are brown economic immigrants. Hitler was right about how traitorous the middle and upper classes are. How is the U.S. regarding class and views? Rightfully so! Any adult responsible for instructing your child who dares to try and turn them against their ancestors deserves a beating at the least.</p>
<p>Very interesting! So you're basically a Prussian? Polish up the Pickelhaube! What are your views on Prussia?</p>
