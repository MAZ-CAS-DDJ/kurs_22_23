<p>This is probably gonna make you cringe at my ignorance, but bear with me. </p>
<p>I've been reading a lot more Evola and some of things about the fascist worldview that didn't make sense to me are starting to become very clear, but I have a quick question in regards to the whole solar/lunar dichotomy and I thought you would probably be the best person to ask.</p>
<p>Evola frequently talks about both lunar and solar worship, and how they represent two different aspects of reality (the earthly and heavenly, or physical and metaphysical). Now from my understanding, the primordial races which we base our ideology off of followed solar principles, while decadent races that came after them typically followed lunar principles. I understand the distinction between the two, but I don't see how it fits into some of the symbolism referenced and our worldview as a whole.</p>
<p>For example: the the yin yang. In the yin yang both yin and yang contain small amounts of the opposite principle within each other, and balance each other out harmoniously. This sort of balance is referenced many times in many different societies, but unless I am mistaken, the primordial race strictly worshiped solar principles. If this is true, and if we base our ideology on these solar principles, then what does this mean in relation to the idea of balance between the principles? When we use solar principles to guide ourselves how do lunar principles fit in and balance it all out, if they do at all? </p>
<p>Basically my question is this: What is the correct balance between lunar and solar principles in our worldview? Do we strictly abide by the solar, or is there some balance with both lunar and solar? And if a balance between lunar and solar exists, is that balance in reference to the society as a whole or should it be found inside the individuals as well? Should the noble castes strictly be solar with the lower castes being more lunar and feminine in principle? (feminine in the sense that they achieve purpose through devotion to the higher castes)</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you answer or not, thank you for humoring me. </p>
