<p>Family friend needed to get her chaplet fixed so she took me with her to the jeweller,  ended up spending a few hours talking about making things. I'm kinda considering taking up jewelry making as a side thing for extra cash, even if it's probably not the man list profession I guess</p>
<p>She was impressed with my woodcarving and knot making so I sorta has me motivated I guess. Gonna make a rosary for my mom as a late christmas resent with what I learned.</p>
<p>Well they probably appreciate honesty, I was honest will telling my current employer about me DUI and he seemed to respect the honest enough it improved my chances </p>
