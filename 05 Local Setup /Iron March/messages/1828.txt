<p>Word of advice. Get a special contract or don't go Infantry. If you can get an Airborne guarantee or (if you're up for it) a Ranger guarantee, then I'd go Infantry. Recruiters can do that very easily, you just have to <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">ask</span> insist for it. Airborne is really easy, even if you're just a decent runner. Ranger is 3 months of misery and pain for a lifetime of pride. You just have to love heights for both the schools, since Airborne is included in Ranger. I wouldn't sign a basic Infantry contract if I could do it again. I had a great time while in Fort Riley with 1st ID, but now I'm in an Armor unit and shit's so fucking retarded. We're basically bloody mechanics, and we're an Infantry Company.</p>
<p>So, to summarize, if you can't get Airborne or Ranger (which would more or less guarantee you one of the more prestigious units), I wouldn't go Infantry. Personally I'm trying to go Airborne right now, but it's quite difficult to get it after Basic Training. Unit costs and time lost and whatnot. I'd never do Ranger though, I've seen tough motherfuckers come back broken from there.</p>
<p>Good luck either way.</p>
