<p>I know little about Ljubljana, except that it is beautiful! Also the first wheel was found in the marshes there, and there are many castles. This was from a sixth-grade project: it has finally paid off <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /><br /><br />On that I will rely, on asking you! Hvala! What books should I read about it? Or books from the Balkans! Yes, I have never been to Europe, but we have a lot of diaspora here and I like central/Eastern Europeans(slava slava slavaaaa) very much. Countries who have been under Communism/Bo<span>ljševici has a stronger hold on their religion and pride. </span><br /><br />Oh you are fluent! This is exactly what I needed, this will be perfect. We shall practice! I will learn Croatian, and you will feel the joy of giving me the language. And you can laugh at my grammar! So, it will be good for both of us, mutually beneficial. My father taught me a little, he learned in his youth and biked through Croatia/Herzegovina/Serbija for months during the war before I was born. I know some words which I will surprise you with throughout the conversations. This was the first he taught me: "<span>Ja</span> <span>ga</span> <span>ne želim</span><span>.</span> <span>Možete ga</span> <span>imati</span><span>.</span> <span>On</span> <span>je</span> <span>predebela</span> <span>za mene</span><span>." </span><br /><br />I would be liking to move to Europe! I would choose Croatia/Balkans over Sweden because I feel more a connection there. Also Sweden is Protestant. And, it is... Sweden.<br /><br />Also, I should introduce myself! Hello, Torquemada(turk killer?) It is nice to meet you.

To prove that I do not just do this through the Google translater!)<br /> </p>
