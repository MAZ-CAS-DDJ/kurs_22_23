<p>I'm assuming your chat doesn't have many if any at all actual fascists in it simply by virtue of association with TRS but then again I don't know anything about any groups or cliques or prominent individuals on TRS save for a few that surfaced to attention recently by various means and I know nothing about Fash Britannia other than seeing the name of the podcast on the website.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Point being I have a certain opinion of TRS as you said so I can only judge what your chat might be like from that limited knowledge, and if my estimations are not wrong then I imagine things getting confrontational, but I'm <em>up</em> for it if you're <em>up</em> for putting <em>up</em> with me.</p>

<p>Happy Current Year.</p>
