<p>Are from America if I am not mistaken correct? I feel like I've messaged you before but I can't quite remember what we talked about if I indeed started a conversation with you.</p>
<p>But if you're from the US I have a project that could use help.</p>
<p>If you are not from the US then I am sorry for this faux pa.</p>
