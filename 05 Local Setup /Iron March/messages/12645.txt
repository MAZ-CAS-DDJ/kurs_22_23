<p>I have not heard about the refugees. It is almost as if they completely disappeared into thin air. You will hear a story every so often about how you should feel bad about them, but they are hidden, I guess Trudeau does not trust us, the first day they arrived a young kid ran up to one and pepper sprayed them in the eyes, after that, nothing. Only thing I heard was they were complaining about living in hotels instead of houses.</p>
<p>Asians have a weird history in Canada, the largest group for the longest time was Japanese, who I really have no problem with so long as they aren't too large in population, they are strong people. Recently more Chinese have come with money as Chinas economy continues to grow, BC is quite nice and a desired place to go. To be honest my view on Asians is really indifferent, Vietnamese are really the only problems with drugs, Koreans and Japanese who migrate here are incredibly well educated I go to school with them and I have never seen a slum associated with then. Our main problem is Blacks and Arabs like every country.</p>
