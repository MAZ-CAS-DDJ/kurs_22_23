<p>I like the mix of material (soldiers dying in the middle east, whites in SA and Rhodesia etc) with the 'spiritual' (your childrens souls eroded, become a man above time). I think the 'bruder you killed me' is a good template to work from.</p>

<p>'JVT was right' i think is a good one to, superimposing that on the image in Ratbag's sig, of him giving the camera a look of 'what the fuck are you doing, white man?' You have to make it colourful to get people's attention, and a pissed off bloke gets a lot of looks. </p>

<p>Stephensen used humour with his political commentary. This is from the Publicist, referring to the war. "Wanted: 500,000 young Australians, must be physically fit, perfect in wind and limb for use in Europe as soil fertilisers. Apply stating nitrate content of body to No. 10 Downing Street, England." </p>

<p>I think we also need to have different tiers of propaganda, for the bloke in the street but also for the blokes in suits and the kids in the universities who think they know everything. I have a little plan for making a group, and the posters I put up will have that quote from my sig "Our Australia, ours to hold and develop..." The first time I read that I realised I'd never seen anything like it, that kind of nationalism that we can make this country just about perfect if we really tried.</p>

<p>“Europe, indeed, may prove to have been no more than the experimental laboratory of the white race; which may eventually find its fullest maturity in our Australia…” </p>
