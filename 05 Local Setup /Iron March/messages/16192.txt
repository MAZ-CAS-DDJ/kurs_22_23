	Hey man I have a few questions if you don't mind. Since you're in the Navy, you already went through MEPS and the whole recruiting process.

	Yesterday I met with my new Marine Corps recruiter for the first time. When asking the medical questionnaire, the only thing that I accidentally admitted was having a cat allergy - like having itchy eyes and that's it. He kinda smirked and laughed it off, and said something like "that's nothing". I wasn't paying attention to if he wrote it down, but I'm 80% sure he didn't. However, if he did, and I go to MEPS, how fucked would I be?Â

	Also, did you disclose anything medical with your recruiter?
