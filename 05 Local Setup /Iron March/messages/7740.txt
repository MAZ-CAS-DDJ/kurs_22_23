<p>I listen to some RAC and find it fun specifically because it's so cheesy. It's basically the nationalist version of people who make parody songs on youtube. I don't think anyone listens to exclusively RAC music.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What people listen to does influence their beliefs though. Even if people claim not to be influenced by the media that they consume it does inevitably happen subconsciously. For example plenty of airheads here watch Jersey Shore and stuff because "it's funny to watch stupid people" and then have to catch themselves to stop from imitating the stupid characters on their TV show.</p>

<p>Any group that promotes something positive is good. It goes against the vast majority of MTV radio music that promotes lack of pride and self respect. A lot of people here especially since the internet have started to listen to underground and/or foreign artists on their mp3 players instead of just the Hollywood propaganda on the radio and they really do tend to have a better value system.</p>

<p>Even if BS don't openly sing about nationalism as long as they promote positive things and just tacitly support nationalism then they are doing a net service for the cause. Serbia is an awesome country from what I've seen.</p>

<p>As for ableism most leftists here hold that the the Warsaw Pact and Communist Chinese did communism "wrong" because they had a large oppressive government and poor human rights record (though of course never as bad as whatever country the leftist themselves is from). I suppose that these strong centralized governments recognized the value of having successful sports teams for political purposes and a healthy population for economic purposes. They also seem to have diverged intellectually from the critical theorists in the west who care about more 'power struggles' than worker vs capitalist.</p>

<p>BTW how many languages do you speak?</p>
