<p>I dont care too much about elaborate haircuts, I got a haircut today and just got a plain 1mm haircut across the field, I dont know whats its called. Almost like a skinhead cut or something, even though I'm not one. I just cut it really short then let grow to decent lenght again, I shave for all the moneys worth as they say. This version looks cool and not too hipster as far as I can tell, I considered maybe trying something like that myself once. </p>

<p>Also no one will know that you have a Hitlerjugend cut, they'll just think you're doing like a stylish hipster thing. </p>

<p>It would be really silly if I posted the pic for you, just send me the link here and I'll figure out how to make it work, and I'll tell you how to it. You just have to upload it to imgur, get a direct link, click the image thing here and paste the link. If it doesnt work I can think of something else, like getting a gyazo screencap of it and then posting that direct link to the image, we'll figure something out. Post it if you want, just hide your face. Dont worry about the bants, you just need to learn to handle them well. Worry about revealing your anonymity too much. Its better to be anonymous on a fascist forum then not, even if you're not afraid of being a fascist in public. </p>

<p>I didn't make any progress, I'm binge watching X Files now as I prepare for the new episodes to air, and have been playing Distant Worlds Universe, a space grand strategy game. Its like a 4x space game, so I get to play out my own custom empires story how I want, so its been fun. </p>
