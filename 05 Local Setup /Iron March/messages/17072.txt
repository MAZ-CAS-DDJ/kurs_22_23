	Nah, I don't think you are right. The Croats were part of the Catholic influential zone, that's all. So were we along with a lot of other nations, and I would rather follow the orders of Vatican and Vienna than that of Independists motherfuckers like Henry VIII, Luther or Calvin. Catholicism and Modern Western decadency are the antithesis of each other, and serving in itself isn't wrong, the question is who do you serve.

	I am against all kind of artificial changes in language, but that's not a Croat specialty. Let's take a look at your friends the Romanians: their language was changed in a much greater extent by their Chauvinists to prove "muh Latin identity". The funny thing is that after the Soviet occupation they were even trying to make it more Slavic. The other thing is their reliability. Let me quote a Hungarian-Canadian writer about that, who is maybe the most-cited writer among Hungarian Nationalists when it comes to Romania (additions with brackets by me):

			Romania betrayed his allies six times in sixty years - an average of once every ten years. According to George Jonas, a (Hungarian-) Canadian writer, if we can talk about the virtues of individual nations, such as the German people’s conscientious work ethics, then we can talk about their faults of character as well. As a negative example, Mr. Jonas mentions Romania among all other countries of the world for its unreliable behavior towards its allies.
		</p>

		<p>
			1. During the Balkan wars Romania betrayed its primary ally, Bulgaria. In exchange, as a reward, Romania obtained three thousand square miles from its former ally, Bulgaria. (That was Southern Dobruja/Cadrilater. Of its population 2.4% were Romanians at that time...)
		</p>

		<p>
			2. Romania disregarded the neutrality treaty with the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, and when it adjudicated that the Allied powers has greater chance to win the war, Romania bound a secret contract with the Entente Powers, and as a result, Romania attacked Hungary in 1916.
		</p>

		<p>
			3. Romania broke alliance with the Entente powers and made peace with the Central Powers in Bucharest.
		</p>

		<p>
			4. Romania broke Hungary’s Peace Treaty agreement signed by both partners in Bucharest, and after the collapse of the monarchy, attacked Hungary.
		</p>

		<p>
			5. Romania betrayed the Allied Powers and stood by Hitler's side when he was a rising star. Therefore, Romania returned (Northern) Transylvania to Hungary.
		</p>

		<p>
			6. When Hitler was about to lose the War, Romania betrayed the Axis powers, turned over to the Allies and once again, as a reward, received Transylvania.
		</p>

		<p>
			According to Mr. Jonas, the level of Romania’s duplicity is unparalleled in the history compare to all other countries.

	There was only one man who stood up against these short-life alliances of interests instead of principles. It was Codreanu:

	Regions like the Banat and Transylvania was built up by Germans, Hungarians, Romanians and Serbians, but under the leadership of the Monarchy - and look at them now. Today there is almost no Germans left in either of these areas, and the Hungarians are also dying out. You can check the ethnic statistics.

<p>
	Even with this I don't see these as arguments against your nations, only against Chauvinism.
