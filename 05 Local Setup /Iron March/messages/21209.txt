	Hi I'm Dagon. We probably haven't talked before. I used too talk with a guy from Venezuela who went by the name Beto. I mainly just wanted to open the dialogue. I have some fellow guys who are interested in going to Europe and living closer to nature and away from society. Moving around and meeting all the fascists groups we can. We now have interest in Venezuela and what you have going on there. So any questions you have for me I'm willing to answer. As for you I'd like to know what the situation in Venezuela is.Â
