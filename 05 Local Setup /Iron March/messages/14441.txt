	Here, we have ultra-leftists in charge of everything. The Oakland area used to be a center of "paleoconservatives," traditionalist anti-globalist Republican types, but they were pushed out by the Black Panthers into the suburbs in the '60s. And then hippies came in and swamped them out entirely. Now the whole East Bay area is a leftist hellhole. And San Francisco/San Jose is in some ways even worse. It's safer than some of the ghettoes that exist around here (I'm in a safe area thankfully), but politically combines cultural leftism with globalist corporatism. Silicon Valley companies are the main pressure behind TPP.<br /><br />
	My home region is the Pacific Northwest though, which is mostly white aside from Seattle having a lot of Asians and Tacoma having a black population from the Navy setting up shop there. The Seattle area and Portland (Oregon's main city) are getting increasingly more leftist, Seattle has a Socialist City Councilwoman and the conservative types are a dying breed. But the rest of that region is as close as you'll get to white paradise in the US, outside of Montana and the Mormon areas. And the Mormons want more Latinos nowadays.
