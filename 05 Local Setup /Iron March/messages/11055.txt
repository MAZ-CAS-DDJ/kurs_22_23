<p>Thanks, Balder. I actually bought Beyond Good and Evil not to long ago, I can't wait to start reading it. However, first I am going to finish For My Legionaries, which is excellent so far. I think that it is going to be one of the best books I ever read. Also, thanks for the advice on the Nietzsche shirt, I have to pick one up some time. Unfortunately, that will probably have to wait awhile, because I just order a CD by the group Arditi. Have you ever heard any of their stuff? Anyways, thanks for the advice as always I appreciate it.Â </p>
