<p>I have been studying a lot; and I know, I know; excuses are like assholes. Everyone has one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The other issue is that when I do browse the forums, the times I have seen some questionable things, I was unsure if I should take an action, because they were sort of borderline. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What I am going to do, then, is begin editing / warning anyone that is sperg'ing etc. and be more liberal with my power. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am somewhat embarrassed that I haven't done much of anything -- and I will change that immediately and try to take some time each day to look throughout the posts. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>SInce I am in a different timezone, I think I can be a valuable contributor to the board because I can catch posts at strange hours of the day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'll get on this &amp; try to do a better job.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Apologies.</p>
