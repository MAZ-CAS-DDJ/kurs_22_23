	Y U do dis maaan? Croatia is a thousand year old historical fact, just like Serbia, and when you say that they are Serbian by blood, implying that you are the same people, it means that this works the other way around too, like Serbs are "Orthodox Croatians". Both of these viewpoints are idiotic. You share the same ancestor, yes; but you took different paths, like Czechs and Slovaks (Ethnogenesis 101). If something is artificial, than that's Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia as national identities (they could have been worked under different - Traditional - circumstances but that's another topic).

	That's like saying that the Carpathian Basin belongs to the Hungarians, only that in some point of time this was true, while I don't know even one momentum in history when the whole territory of Croatia was called Serbia (if you do, I would be glad to hear it). Historically Croatia was a bastion of Catholicism, thus they will be always protected by that influential zone. Basing your future on their extermination means another war which will only weaken our people further.
