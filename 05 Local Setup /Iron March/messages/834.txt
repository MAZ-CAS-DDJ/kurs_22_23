<p>The interview with Ms Speranskaja was particularly encouraging, given her declared adherence to Revolutionary Conservatism. I am left with one question, though: why is it that they have this set of ideas sometimes, and yet, as <em>Foundations of Geopolitics</em> (the geopolitical ideas of which seem to be unique to that particular book) shows, a radically different set other times?</p>
<p>Essentially, in both cases they advocate the creation of international power blocs of nationalist groups, but on the internet they have several all around the world, of a decidedly multinational nature; in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#Content" rel="external nofollow"><em>Foundations</em></a>, on the other hand, they have only a very few, which are more like empires as they are run by specific countries (for example, all of Central and Western Europe is run by Germany, and the "Atlantic" nations are decidedly screwed because the only movements promoted there will break up the countries, making them more prone to Eurasian domination.</p>

<p>An interesting question. I have never read the book, so I can not be sure how accurate the Wiki article is. I can see the differences though. To be quite honest, I have always liked the idea of a German+Russian alliance against the decadent west (which could have been possible under Strasser in his early years), but I dislike that the other European nations (especially Britain "being totally cut off") not being allowed to join a united Europe. Then again, I suppose Britain wouldn't concern me personally (not even having a shred of British heritage). </p>
<p>As for the Atlantic nations, I am not too concerned. I do not know how you feel about your own Canadian nation, but I identify more with my own European heritage (I hate Americanism) than I do with my American "citizenship". It seems like Eurasianism would be the perfect movement to support seeing as how it would break America up along ethnic lines (which is what I think should be done anyway). </p>

<p>I think I will end up creating a new account, I don't like this name, and I don't want to seem fickle by constantly changing everything. This last year has been an immense ideological transformation for me and I think that is what makes the people on SP suspicious of me. Up until the end of may last year I was the most ardent Hitlerite you could imagine, even getting into esoteric Hitlerism and nonsense about Hitler being the "kalki avatar". After my departure from SF and the reactionary scene I began swinging toward orthodox Marxism when it just didn't feel right - than I arrived at Strasserism/Conservative Revolutionary when I almost thought I would take Southgate's path toward NA I swung back around full circle and found solace in Dugin and National Bolshevism. I have learned more this year than I have in the past 2 that is for sure and I think I am stuck at NB. </p>
<p>Anyway sorry for the rant, but yea you will probably see my new intro thread.</p>
