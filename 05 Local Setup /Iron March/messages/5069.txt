<p>Personally I don't like Imperialism-- the Japanese Empire, especially in the 20th Century was self-implementation of western imperialism and contained same "bonzen" elements the Natsoc in Germany sought to destroy or re-constitute. Furthermore it was very bad at administering the military strategically and had a very weak executive. This lead to all kinds of things like war with potential allies like Nationalist China and un-winnable wars like the Greater East Asian War. Colonization of Korea was rather unavoidable at the time, because of the Russian threat but a more nationality-minded government could have better administered it (obviously we didn't do such a good job looking at how butthurt they are now, compared to, say, Singapore about the English). </p>

<p>If Japan had a truly fascist revolution and not half-assed factional authoritarianism during the early 20th Century it may have been able to avoid the ills that befell it in the late 30's~40's leading up to the current situation vis a vis the United States and ZOG. Kita Ikki, for example, one of the most prominent right-wing thinkers of the prewar period (executed for his part in the 2.26 uprising in the 30's) actually wanted some sort of self government for the colonies and alliance with China (in fact, being the Pan Asian national revolutionary he was he took part in the 1911 Revolution in China himself). </p>

<p>That being said they did what they had to do to keep Japan free from the west by doing what the west was doing themselves and now the nation is paying the consequences in the form of mutual mistrust between major East Asian powers despite the end of the Cold War. Also, despite what the commies try to tell you, the Emperor had little part in real policy from the 20's on, except in his role of ending the war.  </p>
<p>Sorry for sperging lol</p>
