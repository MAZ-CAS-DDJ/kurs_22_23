<p>Well I haven't been following developments for a couple of years now since I grew distrustful of all nationalist movements we have going out there but I doubt anything changed much, still, I wouldn't quote myself on this as I'm hardly an expert, but the overall trends are disturbing and that's why I never joined any movement and am working on making my own.</p>
<p>1) Barkashov was kicked out of the RNU after he was forced at gun point to make a video apology to gays, blacks and jews, it was a "most shamefur dispray" - now the RNU is lead by a council, while Barkashov and his loyalists created a splinter faction "Barkashov's RNU".</p>
<p>Overall the RNU was probably the best nationalist movement we had in the late years of the USSR and early 90s, I would've certainly joined it in its glory days - they were organized, outspoken, provocative, not afraid of anything, even partook in the defense of the House of Soviets in the events of Black October (the 1993 constitutional crisis) and had propaganda afterwards including promises of taking action against everyone involved in the destruction of USSR and behind the Black October events.</p>
<p>They would've made for a great legacy if they had stopped existing sometime after the Barkashov incident, however they still exist in a sort of comatose state, they have no actual presence despite still existing, they are a memory but they are still somewhere out there doing nothing, so that knowledge kind of soils what otherwise could've been a good legacy to look back to.</p>
<p>Their ideology was reasonable in that it didn't go  to the 90s skinhead extremes of "murder all non-Russians" because they defended the minorities native to Russia, so in that sense they were much closer to real Russian nationalism of the Ivan Alexandrovich Ilyin kind. Nowadays few organizations have any sort of impact like what the RNU did in its glory days.</p>
<p>2) There's no real division of some groups being given an elastic treatment or others getting brutally repressed, so far the only groups that had been given the "iron glove treatment" are those that overplayed their hand or acted out too much, spoken out for murder too much and so on, so quite frankly it was justified, legally speaking.</p>
<p>It's all open debate as to whom may be a state puppet, it was very much believed that Belov (Movement Against Illegal Immigration) was a cryptojew and working for jews or the state. Mostly such accusations happen over ideological lines, if you deviate from the views of another you're already a prime suspect for being cryptojew state puppet to lead nationalists astray. Honestly the whole thing is in disarray, there is no united movement going on as such, no unified front.</p>
<p>Example: organizers of the yearly Russian March (Belov, Demushkin, Borovekov) didn't want the new Great Russia movement to join the march for some petty personal reasons, when the movement showed up to the march anyway the organizers called the police - nationalists calling the police against nationalists. Wrap your head around that, and all of those are probably some of the most visible figures of early 2000 Russian Nationalism, but they are decaying.</p>
<p>I do believe I already voiced a clear statement as to what Putin is: he is a typical politician, he in it for himself not any higher purpose, he wants to join the "club" of VIP-politicians of the world but he wants to do that on his own terms so he can't show any weakness, ergo why all his politics in foreign affairs do have a defensive flavor to them - if Russia is weak then he has nothing to bargain with against other vip-politicians, so he does only so much for Russia that gets him that strength, however he is an extremely clever politician, no doubts there, he used perfectly legal means to consolidate his power every step of the way. He is no nationalist, he will say a relatively nationalist sentiment once in a while but only if the situation calls for it, otherwise his actions show that he, as a typical politician, doesn't really care for nations one way or another and deals with them only in so far as he needs to, if  there is a nation-based problem then he'll take national aspects into account to solve it, otherwise citizenry is whats important, purely numbers matter, hence why so far we've been allowing so many immigrants to flow into the country - work force.</p>
<p>However one must also understand that our situation differs from that in Europe, people we call immigrants today used to be our countrymen for hundreds of years via USSR and the Russian Empire, while modern Russian nationalism has degenerated from an Imperial one to a Nation-state one. We must deal with immigrants but not in the sense that Europe must deal with immigrants, same for muslims - we have to deal with them in a different way than Europe has to deal with them, its different circumstances and different history and I can't stress that enough.</p>
