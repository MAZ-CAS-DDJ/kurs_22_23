<p>Hey boys. All three of us have said in the Aus Action thread that we are going. 11AM at parliament house. How will you both get there? I'll probably be on the tram, so if you guys are catching the train we can meet up at a station and walk up to parliament house, unless you're getting there someway else.Â </p>
