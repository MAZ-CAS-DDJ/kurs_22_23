<p><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Hello Vladimir, I think, we got off on the wrong foot the other day and I understand we have differences of opinion in many areas, but this should not dictate the way we talk and communicate on other subjects.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">I propose a fresh start, I apologise for inadvertently offending you, and I'm sure the comments you made were simply in the heat of the moment, not to be taken seriously.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">I still do not approve of the way you view Stalin and you have the same attitude to my sympathy for Hitler. This is understandable.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">I hope you consider my offer of appeasement.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Good night, Ben Barton.</span></span></p>
