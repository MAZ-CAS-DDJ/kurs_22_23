	Great, here goes:
</p>

<p>
	1. I looked it up and Australia has hate speech laws that forbid offending people for race/ethnicity/etc. (just like we have). What's your strategy concerning this? Seems to be fuck those laws, we'll use offensive posters and swastika stickers all we like and try not to get caught. Or are there legal precedents allowing political use of the swastika?
</p>

<p>
	2. Tie-in with the above. If you're trying not to get caught and prosecuted/sued for offending or whatever by guarding anonymity, how do you guys prevent shills/informers from trying to join and figure out who you are?

	3.<em> You will be required to take up a pseudonym to ensure anonymity for your own safety. We will train you on how to maintain this, communicate securely and ensure anonymity during activism. </em>- could use some advice on this point (as you have experience).
