<p>yeah, I just wasn't sure what you meant. It is very hard to criticise Craig's work, he really approached things with the same bravado as NA while trying to also keep a low profile. People may want to rethink the black metal look but I think overall it was fairly solid and mitagated the political aspect - at times a little too pretendtious so we may want to think about that.</p>

<p>I think we have security handled - really by the nature of the activity which is all about authenticity, and the reality of what you are doing - future media will rely on exaggeration from second hand sources. People boasting that they are doing military training, or that they are paramilitary/millitia groups. Jihadi's have been Jailed in the UK for paintball - why? because they were doing it under the auspices of 'the islamic front for the liberation of rochdale' or whatever. First rule of fight club and all that - though I am in favour of producing films. Preserving the anonymity of attendees is also important because their words would also be used in any article - you are in a good position as the only name they have is Matt Tate - you will really throw them a curve ball. Obviously Craig's public persona was a major factor in the story as well.</p>

<p>We can't rule out journalists but there was no mole collecting footage or making reports at the previous camps so those in attendance should all be considered above suspicion. Speaking of which, having a list of those attentees should be your priority</p>
<p>Now, promotion. For practical purposes you may not need a website - as long as you have a way of contacting people. Smart graphics and a facebook group is probably best for our purposes. A site would be cool when we have stuff on the side - I would be willing to help design it and contribute, but a domain would be your call. I don't think there is any point in a free website, if it is good enough to be on the web it needs to be a full site.</p>
