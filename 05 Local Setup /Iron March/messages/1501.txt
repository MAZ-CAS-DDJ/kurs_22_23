<p>Yeah, but it makes me feel like banging my head against a wall. I'm not sure how I started that thread arguing, or atleast wanting to, for Nordics, and end up having to debunk their multitude of misconceptions, deceptions, and outright falsehoods. Hell, I believe the Solutrean hypothesis, but these same people seem to think it means Aryans-Nordic ubermenschen established the Aztec and Incan empires several thousand miles way and 19,000 yrs later! Not to mention, the Clovis culture met a near extinction during a mini-Ice Age during the opening of the Alaskan corrider(pardon improper terminology).</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I don't know why a Slav or an Egyptian are pretending to be Nordic and Aryan. Hell, I can't believe the one guy had the gall to claim Egyptians were Aryan and Jews weren't. The Egyptian religion was, if nothing else, a cthonic-maternal one, just as the Caananite, Sumerians, and Assyrians were. There's really nothing in the ancient Egyptian religion nearly as "spiritually Aryan" as the death of Samson, either.</p>
