<p>I'm going to get a copy of the Anointed Standard Translation myself.</p>
<p>I've been doing a lot more research and I've pretty much come to accept Dual Seedline Theory. I've worked out the small problem I had with the flood being local (which it was) and not global. It was simply my misunderstanding of the text; remnants of a globalist church worldview.</p>

<p><strong>	God promised no more floods like the Genesis flood</strong></p>
<p>What about the Genesis 9:11 and 9:15. If the flood was local, did God lie, since floods have destroyed local areas since the Genesis flood.</p>
<p></p><div>"And I establish My covenant with you; and all flesh shall never again be cut off by the water of the flood, neither shall there again be a flood to destroy the earth." (</div><div><em>Genesis 9:11</em></div><div>)</div>
<p></p><div>and I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and never again shall the water become a flood to destroy all flesh. (Genesis 9:15)</div>
<p></p>
<p>The first part of the verse is a promise not to exercise universal judgment by means of a flood, "all flesh shall never again be cut off by the water of the flood." The flood, although local in extent, was global in judgment, since all humanity lived in the same locale. It wasn't until God confused the languages (Genesis 11) that people began to spread over the earth. So, God promised to never again execute universal judgment of humans by means of a flood. The second part, "never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth" can be explained by other verses found in the Genesis flood account.</p>
<p></p><div>Gen 6:11 Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God, and the earth was filled with violence.</div>
<p></p><div>Gen 6:12 And God looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.</div>
<p></p>
<p>The passage in this instance refers to the people of the earth, since planet earth itself was not corrupt. Likewise, Genesis 9:11 is referring to the people of the earth rather than the planet itself. Ultimately, even if the flood were global, it did not "destroy the earth," but just the people on the earth. As stated <a href="http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/localflood.html#people" rel="external nofollow">above</a>, "people" is often understood from the Hebrew word <em>erets</em>.</p>

<p>I'm pretty satisfied with that answer. It's been something that was bothering me for a while because a lot of CI articles didn't deal with that specific passage, but I knew from all extra-biblical evidence that it wouldn't have been likely to be a global flood but it conflicted with my understanding of scripture at the time.</p>
<p>The above site has some good articles too, but some articles are hit and miss as you can expect with pretty much everything, including some CI websites and sects. As for everything else, I think I explained it pretty well in my message about the beasts of the field.</p>
