	That's an interesting perspective. But I still don't see how that will fix Modernism in Europe. Letting in Migrants will not "fight modernism". Fighting Modernism is in the hands of us. Like I said before, we must educate the next generation on how to be strong, and to not rely on materialism. This is why I won't raise a child in the United States. Children become consumers when they are first born here. Commercialism and Advertisements convince people that they will be happy if they buy more. Its sickening. Capitalism is a Jewish system, and it is destroying Nationalism.
