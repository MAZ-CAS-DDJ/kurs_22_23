	Islam is not as bad as people make it out to be on here, essentially its in the same spirit as the Bible and I think it expresses the same universal truth. I have no idea why Islam is considered anti-racist, that might just be an Arab meme to get people to convert. Islam only gets beaten out in racism by the Old Testament (where God commanded genocide of different ethnic minorities). The other things I can't seem to reconcile is Christianity's pacifism and general cuccery, I'm not sure I have the evidence to explain it away and a lot of what the average fascist says to explain it away stands on shaky ground, it's just their own interpretation and we can't possibly know if it's right or wrong. I would personally never convert to Islam, but I believe that the Quran has a lot of truth to it, maybe even more than the Bible. The problem where Europeans + Islam comes in is if they put more allegiance in Islam than their own people then you're just shooting yourself in the foot by tolerating muslim fascists. And I don't think there is anything wrong in putting religion first but the conventional version of Islam is basically Arab supremacism. Atomwaffen has a few muslim members so we will see how they do before I come to a conclusion about whether or not its possible
