<p>Elevenish?! Jesus, now I really do feel like I missed out. Gutted I had to leave early, I was meeting the family at a restaurant for Mother's Day so it wasn't really something I could get out of. Usually I'd be well up for staying to the end so hopefully they arrange another one of those meet-ups soon, as Ivan mentioned there were a few more people that wanted to come but couldn't make it last Sunday.</p>

<p>Yeah it was great to sit down with people and get straight into it and talk properly about the real issues and hear some decent opinions for once. I don't know about you, but usually with people I don't know I'm quite careful about what words I use, what opinions I give etc, so it was refreshing to cut through all that. We'll have to see what activites Ivan has lined up for us next.</p>

<p>I booked a place on that Legion camp they're doing on 18-20 March today, so it'll be interesting to see what that's like. I've done a little bit of Thai Kickboxing years ago but I'm rusty these days.</p>
