<p>Damn straight, some of the worst people I've met IRL were libertarians, they talked a big game but were never as good advertised. You can tell a cunt from a top lad by the company he keeps and more to the point, the women he pulls. Fair enough some people have gone down a level when they're a wing man or if they've drunk too much, but if you meet a lad who's got a scrubber of a missus and is proud to be seen with her then you know he's a cunt. Trying to teach these kind of people the error of their ways never seems to work either so now I'm just more selective. I'm as selective over my mates as I am with my women because both have fucked me over in the past while the rest have stood with me.</p>
<p>The only people here I'd really give a chance are you, Ben, Danny, the finn and vlad. You seem to be the only guys who've really lived the life instead of coming to it from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Fascism selects for the top people in society, you either brush up your act or you're getting smacked in the head and pushed around; there's nothing really that offends us, we've got good values like that. At the least you're going to get interesting characters in fascism.</p>
<p>Saw the vid, it's sick.</p>
