<p>Nicholas Cage haha, one of my favourite actors. I didn't mind anti-Persian bias in 300 (even though I've been fascinated with their history ever since I read Herodotus as a kid), in fact I liked it that they portrayed them as niggers, historically accurate or not, I like it if a piece of European history is used as a myth to promote a strong message, in this case it was Spartans versus non-European nigger hordes. They exaggerated those elements in Persian empire which made them look more like Ottomans or Soviet communists, two cruel Asiatic empires fighting against European civilization. This has been a European tradition ever since Roland, who became one of the most epic heroes of Europe. In real life Roland was just some nobleman fighting against Christian Basques, but in European mythology he became the ideal of Christian warrior fighting against the Muslims. Gladiator is historically inaccurate too (Gladiator battles never had such high death count, it was mostly 1 on 1 and without deaths in like 80% of cases), so is Braveheart etc.</p>

<p>I liked Rise of the Footsoldier, I also liked classic British gangster film Get Carter. I watched tons of crime movies and even though I don't like organized crime these movies are good, just like spaghetti westerns and other genres portraying tough guys and rogues. People who didn't like these sort of movies when they were younger must be massive faggots. As far as the mafia is concerned, they were always motivated by greed and they were involved in whatever makes money, so it's really stupid to idolize them, they're basically the worst types of parasites. I'll write more in that thread you made. Anyway, Italian-American Cosa Nostra does have an interesting story, personally I find some stories of so-called "workhorse" crews that did all the dirty work interesting. Like the one portrayed in Goodfellas, which is my favourite movie, I read the book too. It's not so much the criminal part that makes it interesting, but the violence, the <span>camaraderie of a crew, "the life", being part of some large group that is known all over the city and everyone fears it or is fascinated with it etc. There are some things that you can relate to in these movies. I also absolutely loved the Sopranos precisely because of these reasons. It was also totally politically incorrect with Tony Soprano being racist all the time and ranting about the fags, the best scene was when he<a href="http://youtu.be/QXLz7IHxJgo" rel="external nofollow"> talked to his daughter's boyfriend</a> who happened to be black, if I'll ever be in this situation I'll react exactly like him. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></span> I remember how many liberals were bitching about it. I understand why they were angry because when we were teens we all wanted to be like Paulie or Tony and obviously we considered their racism cool and imitated it at every chance.</p>

<p>As I said, the footsoldiers of mafia who simply enjoy "the life" are interesting, the higher ups are basically just your typical businessmen crooks.</p>

<p>I liked the movie and series Romanzo Criminale about Banda della Magliana ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banda_della_Magliana" rel="external nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banda_della_Magliana</a> - they were loosely connected to neofascist terrorist organizations too ) from Rome. It has everything crime movie needs to have... Violence, hot women and a good realistic story. I also liked Gomorrah about Camorra in Naples, it's dark and completely realistic portrayal of how mafia terrorizes its own people. </p>

<p>As for the 90s, it's funny that even in Serbia of all countries they're nostalgic about it. They were bombed, under embargo, crime was everywhere and gangs were killing each other all the time, yet even there there was just something mythical about it. <a href="http://youtu.be/dGbnAmUF1_A" rel="external nofollow">This video</a> sums up the 90s in Serbia and Balkan in general - criminals and hooligans in tracksuits in the streets and fitness gyms, melancholic 90s dance music, crime ridden neighbourhoods with huge commie pannel houses... Yet even they are nostalgic. They have "I love the 90s" festivals all the time. 90s music is the best.</p>
