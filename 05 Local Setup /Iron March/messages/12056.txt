<p>sapient yes, but not sure if in the same way as humans. they are on a higher plane of existence and their minds are a few degrees above even the strongest human minds, so if they think exactly like us, I cant say. the romans spoke that the ancient germans did not depict their gods in human forms, or at least not obviously human forms, because they realized they were natural forces of the universe and could take any shape they wanted. it wasnt until later that the vikings and saxons had adopted the roman practice of making human statues of the gods, and they were still marked with abstractness. the myths depict the gods in human form to make them easier to understand; the truth of what was happening in the myths is hard to comprehend for many</p>

<p>they are archetypes but I wouldnt say this means they dont exist as entities, they are the collective consciousness of every person or thing that ever fit that archetype within that race or region. I spoke a little about this regarding Odin in one of the pagan threads and Ive sorta extended this idea to all of the gods, based on the writings of the Heimskringla. Unless Snorri was trying to deliberately make the gods take human form to humiliate them, I think the Yngingatal is about a time in prehistory when the Germanic gods lived in Europe as avatars.</p>
