	So where did you hear about a remake? I really haven't heard anything about that, all I really know is that the company that bought the rights is behind the novel releases and that they won't even release Vol. 3 if the first two don't sell well. Although, if they think they could make some money off of it they probably would do a remake. It would be curious to see. God, knows that I could go for some fiction were a tradical empire wins and is not portrayed as evil.Â
