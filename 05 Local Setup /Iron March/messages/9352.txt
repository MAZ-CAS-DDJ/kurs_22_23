<p>Itnwarms my heart to know you see such value in my calling. Ever since I was small I knew I was made for this. I have seen parenthood held to it's deserved respect in only two places: in the Church, and in the Movement.</p>
<p>My bes friend and sister both claim they do not want children, and it breaks my heart. Life without sons and daughters is not a life at all.</p>
<p>I think you are right, and it excites me. Getting to know you, i can say that i am intrigued so far, and this all through pixels and letters! Sleep well, I hope your dreams are peaceful <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
