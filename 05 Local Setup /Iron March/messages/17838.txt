	I've found the picture over at our Bulgarian National Alliance's facebook page and they didn't say who these nationalists from Hungary are. They just came over and did urban combat training, I'm guessing, since they do it a lot with a lot of foreign nationalists.  I'll ask one of their guys next time we speak. Also, yes they are more serious than Ongal, haha.<br /><br />
	About the symbol, It's the symbol of the founding dynasty of the Bulgarian states - The Dulo Dynasty which has also been found in Iran, Russia and pretty much where Bulgarians are linked to have been. There is even a church in Italy where Bulgarians settled which has the Cross of Jesus shaped into that form. It's also found on royal rossetes in Pliska alongside runes that link to the planet patterns and such. The direct meaning of the symbol is unknown to this date, though. They remade their own rossetes for their modern uniforms, aswell.<br /><br /><img alt="14141826_1247777978598211_59555003712841" class="ipsImage" src="https://scontent.fsof2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14141826_1247777978598211_5955500371284150372_n.jpg?oh=a2dd99ad311a725e8b9f47570978c5b1&amp;oe=59444E4E" /></p>
