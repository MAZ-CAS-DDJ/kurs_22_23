<p>The quote is taken from his autobiography, writen after the king's death. In it Ljotić says that the ideals proposed by him after 6th january dictatorship to the king will be achieved with ZBOR and it's members. He also mentions that the king understood his proposals, but it was too late and he was murdered some time after. At the same time he mourns the loss of a king but is optimistic because the struggle goes on.<br /><br />If it means anything to you here's the original version of the quote:<br /><br />"И цео наш рад од тада јесте да мисао коју смо пред њим толико пута излагали, и коју је<br />напослетку и Он успео да види, да ту мисао, сад кад Њега више нема, у «Збору» и кроз «Збор»<br />остваримо, ради добра Краљевине Југославије, Отаџбине наше."</p>
