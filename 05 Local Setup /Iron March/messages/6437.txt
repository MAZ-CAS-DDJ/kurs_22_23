<p>Thanks for the link. Are there any other ecofascists on here that you know? I am personally not an antisemite or racist for that matter and it seems most of the users here are pre-occupied with race (not sure your stance on the topic). My major concern is for the environment, race is irrelevant. Also do you know any other forums or sites for ecofascist discussion?</p>
