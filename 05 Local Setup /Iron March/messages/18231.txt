	I made the golden mistake of enlisting with the Army out of high school. It has acted as a further eye opener at least, but I cannot wait to leave the Rabbi's legion of Golems. However that is just an aside of frustration. I should be free in the area until April 10th, then I have to go to Texas for some shit. But yeah... I'm down here dicking around. As for Dixie Nationalism I don't really disrespect it, I only find it outdated. I like the symbolism as a Southerner, but I guess I can ideologically be described as a Revolutionary National Socialist in the same vein of James Mason.

	I got no problem with Neo-Confederates we will probably all be shooting nogs from the the pick up trucks together.
