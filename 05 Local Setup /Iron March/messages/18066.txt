	Atlantropa was an ambitious idea. Perhaps rerouting the Nile would accomplish the same result without altering the geography of Europe, but yes I agree. I don't think Sahara Africa's climate is suitable for European colonization thought. We should view the African Union as a reservation for blacks. We could even resettle American blacks in North Africa to drive out the arabs.
