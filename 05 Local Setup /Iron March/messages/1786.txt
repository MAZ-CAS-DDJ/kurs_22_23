<p>You cant find accurate information about them, the same about the germanic tribes.</p>
<p>Because the most of them were destroyed, rewritten or changed. All for christs sake..</p>
<p>There is one thing for sure, they were in different timelines in big regions.</p>
<p>From rhine to balkan, baltic and so one.</p>
<p>Germanic and slavic tribes had the same origin.</p>
<p>Also the name of the slavs came not from sclaveni, sclaveni was only a greek name for them.</p>
<p>Their name came from Swa, it means swan. The swan was used as an heraldic animal in many slavic tribes.</p>

It dont seem quite right for me but im not a russian i cant know for sure...</div></blockquote>
<p>Not the monarchist point of view, but they also didnt like paganism.</p>
<p>The monarchists had to rewritte the russian history because of christianity.</p>
<p>The soviets tried to create the "soviet citizen". And the russians were civilized by the romanov dynasty. (This shit was told by the monarchists and was adopted by the soviets. The same with the germans. The church destroyed almost everything about paganism.)</p>
<p>Alexander Nevsky/Peter the great,  they all were heroes in the soviet union. (So you can see, they had no problem with monarchists, only when it comes to Lenin and the revolution.)</p>
