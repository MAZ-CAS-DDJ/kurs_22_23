<p>Hi, the point is that most people here aren't interested in any rational debate, they spend too much time trying to prove how big fascists they are on the internet, because they can't do that in real life. As I said in some other thread, I've been in real life fascist crew and in the "scene" for 10 years. No one is more loyal than I am and I made tons of sacrifices. I use this forum to see how certain people would react to some views, I don't have anything to prove to anyone. Add me on facebook if you want to debate, I don't have many fascists from other countries on my friend list</p>
<p>This is me:</p>

<p>Just PM me first so I'll know who you are</p>

<p>Sounds good, i'll do that sometime soon. God Bless, 'michaelarchangel'</p>
