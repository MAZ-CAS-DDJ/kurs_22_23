<p>Hey Venator,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I unfortunately lost the original message I sent you, so I'll try to replicate it as best I can. Also, if you respond to my messages I will always write back. As far as the e-mail thing goes just check it and your IronMarch profile at least once a day, that's what I do. Anyways here it goes. To answer your original question the school I go to does not do continental philosophy. It is located in a semi-rural area of Missouri, but I think the reason they don't do continental philosophy is because they are a small university with an even smaller philosophy department. I will admit one of my professors kind of pissed me off when she said that me being a Fascist is a very odd and unusual view for a philosophy student, its not like we don't exist! Although I do hope to go to graduate school for philosophy someday, and I'll make damn sure the graduate school does continental philosophy. The other thing I had mentioned was that perhaps for our first discussion we could discuss Nietzsche's themes in his book The Will to Power, which I am currently reading. I only as that I be given some time to finish it, I have been very busy lately and I am not as far in the book as I would like. Also, if you have a suggestion about what topic we should discuss first, I would love to hear it. Maybe you could get the ball rolling hear or I may have a suggestion in the next few days. Anyways good to hear from you again and I look forward to your next message. But, seriously you may want to get into the habit of checking your e-mail/profile at least once a day. Also, sorry it I sound so formal, that just how I write, I'll work on writing more casually.</p>
