<p>Haha, you're no longer a bone-breaking virgin! It's not such a bad thing to experience.</p>

<p>My first time was the last day of school in 4th grade. I was riding my bike back home with all my books from my desk I didn't usually carry, so the back of my bike was weighted weirdly. In Hawaii the hills are really crazy, and the bike flipped over. I went flying (I was probably like 90 pounds) and my wrist hit a stop sign pole. My parents didn't answer the phone so I held my bike in the other hand and walked the remaining two miles. Really proud of that still.</p>

<p>How liberating it must feel to them when they realize things do not cease to exist outside of their vision.</p>
