	Wow, that's pretty evil. I have one brother i get alongÂ with, one saw sister who's at least a nice girl, and another brother, one who's an autistic violent bastard who attacked me for years and tried to kill my father. So, yeah, we don't talk. My mom abandoned my dad when he was sick so I know what its like to watch them be betrayed by the people they should be most loyal to. Fucking hate that shit. I'm Catholic, what about you?
