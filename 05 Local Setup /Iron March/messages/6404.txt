<p>Of course we should network outside of IM, but not in spite of IM.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taking a softer edge to appeal to a wider audience is a thin line to walk, im not saying we need to be parading around in SA uniforms with swastikas like Rockwell yelling "White power" but we also don't need to appeal to Kosher conservatives anyway.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The charm of IM and any movement that should be started is that it is confident in it's own ideals and though it desires recruitment it's not willing to soften up or lower standards to get it, in other words we do what we do and maintain a confidence that makes us appeal to people who desire radical change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Honesty should always be our guiding principle and so long as we are ideologically honest we'll find respect from people that aren't brainwashed.</p>

<p>As AH said, "We won't be the followers of public opinion but masters of public opinion" (or something like that).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The National Socialist Started with 7 members and didn't soften even when people thought they were crude and too radical and people who desired real change flocked to this kind of integrity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The most softening that AH did was simply to acquire power legally rather than through revolutionary warfare, this is an example of a reasonable way to appeal to a wider audience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'd actually like to start meeting with people on here in a few months (yourself included) to really network something concrete, but i've been having financial trouble which impedes my ability to use the internet (My P.C. broke, I have no internet service or even a Smartphone).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And I also plan to join the military before the year is up as you seem to be planning so that could be an topic of discussion as many American members on here are Military/former military/plan on joining the military.</p>
