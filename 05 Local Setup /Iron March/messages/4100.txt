<p>My wine knowledge is kind of mediocre, but i recognize Mayrodafni, its a really sweet wine, its the brand we use  in church sermons if im not mistaken. Although its best not to have it with food and stuff, it doesnt fit. The other one is from a neat selection, from Naousa in northern Greece, which makes good wine nevertheless. Never tasted the exact brand but coming from Naoussa it must be good.</p>
