<p>As you recommended, I began a conversation with Elegos(he actually did,) and the conversation will continue when he will be available on MSN. Though I was thinking of making a Skype account since I see that it is frequently used by the members of Iron March.</p>
<p>Do you have any of the aforementioned communication programs?</p>
