<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Want to inform you that we gassed thecolonel today because I was told that he, for some reason, wanted to smear you and kalash by finding and posting your nudes on the forum or fabricating the nudes once he couldn't find anything. I checked around asking people who might be able to confirm this and it has been verified. </p>
<p>It's rather weird and seemingly out of left field unless you might know the reason behind this behavior from some private conversations with him? Regardless he's been gassed and removed from the skype groups. We're not making any public statements as to his gassing and the reasons behind it, it's felt like nobody liked him anyway so maybe nobody will bother asking about it.</p>
<p>How is Kalash doing anyway? Has the trial already taken place?</p>
