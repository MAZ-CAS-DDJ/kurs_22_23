<p>Dw Celery. In the name of the Corn Snake I absolve you of your sins. Missed a couple of courses myself so gonna finnish up school too. (20% attendence and 2 Fs, lel). We're still young and all tho so it's arrogant to think we're finding otu the full truth now anyway. We have like 60 years to figure that stuff out.</p>
