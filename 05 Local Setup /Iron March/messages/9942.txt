<p>I'm proud of you Emma, that you realize this. Desire is the root of life, but a simulated release is only to retard its powers.</p>
<p>Can you imagine d'Annunzio, master of desire, watching pornography? If he did, it would destroy him. Life is to be lived, not hidden from and mimicked.</p>
<p>And my desire, as well as my intution, tells me I should be living it with you. I'll never sabotage that for a quick fix.</p>
