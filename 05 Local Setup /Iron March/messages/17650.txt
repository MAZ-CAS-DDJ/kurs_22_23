	That's actually really interesting. After my active duty I plan on either creating a Paramilitary or doing PMC work as well. I've considered the French Foreign Legion if I'm still up for it in the end. Why did you pick Reserves? Have you picked up rank quickly? I hear Reservists get promoted fast. Whats your current rank?
