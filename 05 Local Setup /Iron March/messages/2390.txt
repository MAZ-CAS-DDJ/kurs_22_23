<p>Fascism and National Socialism's forgotten brother.</p>
<p>I must say that I am somewhat disgusted by the pseudonazi proliferation among the site, it seems to have started briefly after I joined. Still, some form of localized extremism here is good to weed out those that are weak, in a sense. Those that can't take the heat of some vocal people. You know what I mean? The world certainly isn't pink, so this forum shouldn't be either. It'll weed the ones that are too concerned about PR out. But still: Having too many of them racists would end up degenerating the forum.</p>
<p>I do look forward to your post if you decide to go ahead with it. I'll support you should they argue against you, because I have little tolerance for uppity Americans that think that they can hijack Germany's identity just because their great great grandfather desserted Germany in favor of the Americas.</p>
<p>I am not fond of Israel at all. Their influence spreads wide through economy and intelligence, and I dislike their treatment of the palestinians. But, so what? They have their country there, and they defend it through force of arms. It's not like they have a choice, they must play hardball or die. They can't simply decide to be "nice". At least they have a warrior culture, as much as I may hate how perjudicial their influence is to other countries. I don't like it as an institution. But I respect it. They use the holocaust, as you mention, to prop themselves up...but well, once more, they don't have a choice. Can you blame a cornered dog for biting? I cannot, but I'm still not going to enjoy being wounded.</p>
