<p>Well they have millions of gypsies.</p>
<p>I am corporatist/integralist, I guess that would sum it up.</p>
<p>In foreign policy I have some identities to hold dear.</p>
<p>First of all the fact that we are being stamped on since centuries by Eastern or Western imperialists.</p>
<p>The other for me is that - like the little antant people jokingly say - we are "mongols" we have some cultural heritage with most ex soviet -stan countries.</p>
