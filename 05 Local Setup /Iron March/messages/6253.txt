<p>I don't know for sure if any people of "Jobbik" wil take part in this, this year, but I suppose they do. Day of Honour is a big event, thousends of people came every year, but more and more is forbidden. A few years ago it took place at the heros square in budapest, but that isn't allowed anymore.</p>

<p>Nice, not many people don't drink in our movement. Some serious people don't drink and some don't drink for a short period of time, like 2 months every year. I only drink on special events, like yule, but I am thinking to quiet.</p>
