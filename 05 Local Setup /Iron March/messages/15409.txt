	Hey Xav, I just wanted to let you know about the next book I plan to read. It comes out sometime in September and is published by Arktos (which I'll admit I usually don't like that company because they have a lot of sperg tier alt right shit) by this one has picked my interest. The book is called <strong><em>Handbook for Radical Right-wing Youth,</em></strong> a collection of essays by <strong>Julius Evola</strong> featuring a preface by <strong>Gábor Vona</strong>, leader of the Jobbik party in Hungary. This has gotten my attention so I think I will check it out. Also, I think I have decided to install The old republic again because I like indulging in a <em>little </em>bit of fantasy sometimes. But, like I said earlier I am not going to go all neckbeard on it though, and just play occasionally and during uni breaks. Sorry, I keep bothering you with the mmo thing. btw I forgot to ask if you ever played it or if you even like Star Wars? Again, sorry to keep bothering you and this will be the last time because I will not uninstall it again. I also wanted to know if the offer to let me know what you think after you finish Mishima's <strong>The Sailor that Fell from Grace</strong>, still stands? Anyways, again sorry for bothering you and thanks for putting up with me as the next couple of months will be difficult as the anxiety/ocd meds are getting out of my system and I find new (non-medication ways) to deal with it.
