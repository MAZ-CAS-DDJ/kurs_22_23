	That's fine -- they are generally just looking for anyone willing to do it. It might be necessary to get an ESL certification -- they have little problems like this randomly. I think there's one in California. I think ther'es also a famous one in Spain. They are often liek 2 month certiication programs and they'll give you a big advantage.

	You could also go to Korea with no experience, get an ESL teaching job and make around $2,200 a month with a paid for apartment. IF you wanted to be very Spartan, you could save $500 a month easily, and $6,000 would be more than enough for Italy and to even do it staying in good hotels.
