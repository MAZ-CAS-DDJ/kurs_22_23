<p>Thank you much. Yes, I clicked that link, a good site! I will be using it, and the ones on history. The adjectives varying according to gender makes sense, yes. I speak some Spanish, it is like that. Only with a few more! The blog explains it well. Well for the project it was to pick a country's capital and research it, and my mother spent time in the city years ago, so that was the one I picked. Quite near your neighborhood and that castle, actually. It's beautiful! Just an excellent land. But no, USA does not teach much about Europe besides the World Wars and holocaust.<br /> </p>
<p>1918 on... Hmm, yes, I wonder what was so controversial! What could have happened! heh-heh, I am joking. I have a small knowledge of those events. But yes, I like Serbs just fine, heh-heh. They are good people. I had Croatian grandmother a few years back, she could not speak but she would smile so gladly whenever I would sing to her in Croatian. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> Good things to remember.<br /> </p>
<p>In that case I shall continue to call you Torquemada! Oh, an inquisitor... It is good to have a little Catholic allegiance in a place!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hopefully I would find work in Croatia some years in the future. I plan on becoming a nurse. America is no place to raise a family! Well, probably I have a more negative impression... I live in a very liberal part!<br /> </p>
