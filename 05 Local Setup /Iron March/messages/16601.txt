	Also, I am not sure if you saw my other replies- me not being completely Romanian, and having British and German heritage would that prevent a lot of Romanians from accepting me there?  Because I am very attracted to its culture, and am learning the basics of the language.  I would like to think I could be a Romanian nationalist still, Codreanu had a Bavarian mother so he was half, but you seem more familiar with the country nowadays.  Could you provide some insight as to if you think Romanians would still accept me as a Romanian nationalist if I were to return there?
