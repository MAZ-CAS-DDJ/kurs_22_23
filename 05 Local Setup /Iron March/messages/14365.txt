I wanted to ask you about Poland and it's initial struggle for patriotism and nationalism. Of course I'm Lithuanian and it interests me what are your thoughts are if one day Lithuanian and Poland nationalists unite? Are you one of those guys who shout: "Wilno nashe" and etc. It's interesting to have a constructive discussion with fellow fascist(national socialist). If you are up for a challenge, write me up!</span>
