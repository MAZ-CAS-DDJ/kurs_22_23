<p>Agreed. With our resources and multiethnic nation we have potential to become a great power to rival the empires of old. One thing that I would promote is the propagation of Canadian culture and try to diverge it from US culture. But our Canadian culture is not tied to any one ethnic group save for the anomaly of Quebec. This allows all ethnic groups to identify with the national culture no matter what they are.</p>

<p>This worked in Singapore and they had a quasi-fascist party running the nation since its independence The Peoples Action Party. So we could brand ourselves as the party of action and progress. Or so that is the idea I have had.</p>
