	Yeah it did, during that period Bulgaria was huge and rich and invested russkie shekels into opening Bulgarian schools and books on Bulgarian for people. Serbia was small, poor and had no foreign backing at the time.<br /><br />
	&gt;They love Bulgaria<br /><br />
	Fuck your civic nationalism, for fucks sake learn something from us. Albanians loved the country they lived in until they got a chance to fuck things up.<br /><br />
	You do realize our Chetnik units fought everyone that wasn't Serb, including Bulgarizied Macedonians. Communists created them, just liek they created Montenegrians and Muslims and broke our lands we bled in two balkan wars and in the great war.<br />
	&gt;Serbia and Russia have always hated Bulgaria<br /><br />
	Yet somehow in Great War Bulgaria found itself allied with the Ottomans. Yeah, fuck Tsargrad, we want more western clay.<br /><br />
	&gt;nato or eu better than russia<br />
	Please tell me how Russia forces cultural marxism on everyone. It was probably Russia who bombed last remaining free European country - SR Jugoslavia. Russia is not bad, Kremlin is bad and mostly for it's own nationalism not the foreigners.<br /><br />
	Russia literally gave you your greater Bulgaria while fucking Serbia over. The only help we ever got from Russia was it's sacrifice in 1914 and thats it.<br /><br />
	&gt;Serbian empire<br /><br />
	our empire ended before 1389, Russia wasn't even a country at that period.<br />

	Are you jelly of Yugoslavia? Dude, it was led by fucking Croats and Jews, Serbian identity and korps reduced to nothing, our holy land taken from us. <br /><br />
	The only reason majority of "macedonians" like Serbs is that we actually slaughtered muslim hordes while BUlgars were idle the whole time wanting to only to rule them. FYROM is rightful Serbian clay, fuck off you already have your own part of Macedonian region.
