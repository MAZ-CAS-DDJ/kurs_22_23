<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First of all I'd suggest creating an introduction topic where you tell us a bit about yourself.</p>
<p>Materials related to Giovanni Gentile would go into the External Materials Archive forum, as for the Chinese Corporatism book - you'll have to give more details on that or better yet provide a link or what have you to the book so we can do a short review and tell exactly where would be the place for it on our forum.</p>
