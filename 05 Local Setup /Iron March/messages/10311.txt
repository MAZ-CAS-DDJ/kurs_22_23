<p>I tried paganism for a while, runes are cool and the music is good but I never really felt anything real. Finally getting the feeling I I always wanted. Hard to explain tho. I'll just say that I've never felt more connected to something higher than myself than before, after I went to a Latin Mass recently...</p>

<p>I think a lot of pagans are just larping, even Varg seems that way sometimes and I really respect him. I really like the Havamal and other literature so it's a shame for certain. </p>

<p>It's all a journey tho, I recommend that you keep searching. There's no discounting community in religion, I'd rather be atheist if there was nobody to share the struggle. So don't feel bad about realizing that. </p>
