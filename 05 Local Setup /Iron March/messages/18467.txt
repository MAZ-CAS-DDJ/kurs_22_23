	Same thing happened to me, journalist got my picture and pple were happy to provide everything else, lost my job, car, home family to "prove" how I was wrong, I actually had to move to England, then Scotland, whilst there another silly old bastard who I trusted sold two stories to the papers on me, the first harmless nonsense whilst the second was aimed at getting me killed.
