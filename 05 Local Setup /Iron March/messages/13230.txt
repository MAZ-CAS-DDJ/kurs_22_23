	From the thread you made, I can see that you have doubts about the idea of all Jews being inherently evil. The problem with discussing this on ironmarch is that the second you do, you'll have about 20 different angry posters going mental. This will most likely never change on this forum and while the plenty of Jews are perfectly normal people you cannot deny that Jews do control a lot more than they should. To keep things simple and to stop an angry mob of iron marchers coming to hunt you down for not hating every Jew on the face of the earth, it's easier to just completely ignore Jews here, or at least to only mention negative aspects of them.
