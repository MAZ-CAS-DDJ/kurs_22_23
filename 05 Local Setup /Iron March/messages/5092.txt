<p>Thank you, your advice has been very helpful. I am going to look into Welsh origins and their pagan roots more. If all else fail I will attempt to look into the Teotl Religions. I haven't looked into the Mexican paganism due to it being primarily dead, and most would find it ridiculous.</p>

<p>Again, thank you for the advice.</p>
