	We are pretty red up here. Mainly basic (R)'s who dislike brown people openly so thats coolÂ but kvetch hard for the kikes (thanks modern baptist church). I'v red pilled a few friends, some were already hip to the JQ. Met a few locals who know whats up on the JQ but to black pilled to even attempt to join something like the Alt right for lack of better term. Whole reason i was on TRS was to try to get into the pool parties and meet some other OH goyim and may still proceed with that but white degenerates aren't white and being a fag is the top form of degenerate. There pro gay rhetoric from leadership is alarming but may be some good goys to save. I here antifa have a decent presence in your neck of the woods?
