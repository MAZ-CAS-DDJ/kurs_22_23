	Never used those books so I can't say. Can't hurt in the end I'd imagine. Memrise is pretty good but I think it mostly just focuses on the vocabulary. My experience with it is very limited however. Duolingo is about grammar, sentence structure and vocab, although you'll want to supplement it with studies that go over the grammar more carefully and in depth if you're anything like me. That can be done through google easily enough I find.
