			Yeah, IDK. Tbh I was pretty cheery when I first heard of what went down, even though it would be a death blow to AW. Of course at the time I hadn't known that the people he'd killed we're National Socialist. It really makes me wonder if things would've been different, had people been more understanding of his viewpoints. Of course there is no excuse for what he did, but it's an interesting thought. But what's more interesting is apparently they had bombs inside the house, along with radioactive materials, yet he didn't think to use them. He didn't even think to use his assault rifle!

	From what I've heard about the circumstances Odin admitted to them being his and said they were used for a science project regarding rockets or something. The compound in question was a high explosive (a primer I believe) so you know, not the type of thing you want for controlled combustion. If he was planning something it makes what Devon did even worse. I'm not sure I'm qualified to speak on the matters related to the AW incident though. I didn't join the forum till after what happened. I had been trying to join every once in a while starting several months back but each time it would say I'm approve and then when I attempt to login say my account doesn't exist. I believe it was a problem with the name I tried originally using (Basileus instead of Autokrator).

			True, but destroying the system takes top priority. If we're destined to die, we should just get it over with, and if our women would be enslaved if we lost...many are enslaved already. We've just got to end this hell. We'll worry about what comes after, later.

	Couldn't agree more, we can worry about cleanup later.

			I saw a Japanese documentary on ISIS where they showed some Arab guys talking about how they couldn't wait to get the Yazidi women, and that the ones with blue eyes were more expensive. They claimed that these people were ISIS, but they were raggedy and unkempt, and not in uniform. Didn't look like the ISIS troops shown off in their propaganda, but who knows the truth.

	There are cases of women joining and being put into sexual slavery from what I've seen in the media. Of course I'm not qualified to speak on the merit of this claim. I've seen a video where islamists behead a young boy who appears to have been sexually abused by them. Seeing that made me rethink the conservatism of some of the islamist factions. Idk I might just look more into claims of rape and sexually slavery by ISIS.

			Devon once said to me that he thought the Yazidis are devil worshipers, and so their slaughter is justified. Of course this is nonsense and I tried to tell him that. Perhaps I should've done it in a better way. I think that he thought I was mocking him, when I was shitposting. For one thing, I said that the devil was based. Lol

<p>
	Oh shit he claimed he did it because people didn't respect his beliefs. Shitposting gone wrong? Nah but seriously how much did you know about him before the incident? Think he gave any signs he was going to do it, and why did Odin tolerate him?
