	I agree about Tradition being about essence, but I can't agree with a stance that throws away that very core of a culture for something foreign. You cannot be a 'Nationalist' and not believe in your own folk, instead finding faith somewhere foreign - but I do not judge harshly those who do so, as it is not my place.

	Yes, I know it is my own fault as broken man, and I try to find ways to 'heal' myself, but I often hit the ground anyway. I don't know what is the root of the problem, and so I cannot fix it. The more I study, the more cynical and skeptic I become.

	Also, about being not Jewish as a God, not exactly. If you believe in the God of the Bible, it is a Jewish deity, and so the God is Jewish, like it or not. I'm not talking about your spirituality or anyone else's - again, it is not my place - but the cold hard fact is that it was a Jewish construct millennia ago, and YHWH survived the infinite pantheons of Mesopotamia to become the Supreme God of the Hebrews, Jews, or whatever you may call them.

	I don't know how to explain the differences between the Truth and reality well, so I ask you to excuse me. It's something that I often meditate about, both in thoughts and words, but living the daily life it seems that reality is just a prison after all, a product of our own construct and environment.
