	Hail victory Odin,
</p>

<p>
	You may remember or have forgotten but I had been a new member of Atomwaffen back in 2016, needless to say a lot of things went down. I'd love to get re-involved with Atomwaffen, my graphic design abilities have improved quite a bit, I've had a lot of time to gain education and I really want to dedicate myself to my people. Again, apologize for dropping out at random and I'd appreciate if I could explain what happened in a Skype chat or something to that effect.
