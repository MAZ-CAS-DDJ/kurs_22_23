<p>Hey Hadit,</p>
<p>This is Blackshirt 13 here. I was wondering if you could help me with my question seeing as how you are into neofolk and martial industrial music too. Do you know if Von Thronstahl is still active? I'm a big fan of their work. Please let me know if you get this.</p>
<p>Hail,</p>
<p>Blackshirt 13</p>
<p>PS I got that Arditi pin that I showed you before. Definitely has a Fascist/Third Positionist look and feel to it.</p>
