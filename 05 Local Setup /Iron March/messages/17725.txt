	Those aren't ideal so you should have proper meals if you can help it. As I said though if you wanna lose the gut you've generally gotta cut down what you eat, but you should eat only real foods if possible. Ease your way into it at the very least. Granola bars are okay and apples are 10/10. Good going m8. Keep it up.
