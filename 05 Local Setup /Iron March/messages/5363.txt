I would not lie to you and say I am the biggest fan of Turks but Turks are smart enough to be civilized and have a functioning society, unlike blacks. I have more in common with you Greek and Armenian enemies then I do Turks but I feel you guys need to resolve your own border disputes. I focus on an Aryan empire in Southern Africa. I will not fight in a war with Turkey for Armenia and Greece. But anyway I am curious... What are your thoughts on the Armenian genocide?</p></div></div></blockquote>
<p>Well we don't have any border disputes. The only people who have a one-sided border dispute are the Syrians and the Armenians.</p>
<p>Though really, if such disputes are in place, the only way to solve them is war. If the Syrians and Armenians are serious about their claims, let them fight for it. We never laid claim to anything that we didn't fight for. It's only fair if they do the same thing that their ancestors did.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now we come to your question. Their ancestors actually wanted to seize a part of the then Ottoman empire for their own nation state, as did the Greeks and many other Balkan nations. However they obviously disregarded the fact that they did not form a majority anywhere in the Ottoman Empire. The Greeks did so in Greece, and formed their own state, so did the Bulgarians, and the ex-Yugoslavian states. I bear no grudges. They were supposed to happen. They are valuable lessons, in fact. But the Armenians miscalculated their position, and thought that Russia would be there to help them forever. But nay, it was not to be. They lost, and were given the same treatment that the Ottoman empire gave out to rebels.</p>
<p>My ancestors, the Turcomans, but from a different tribe than the Ottomans descend from, were sent to the Balkans for their rebellions, their refusal to settle down, and their refusal to submit to the Timar system, instead preferring the olden customs of the time. Just as we, they were rounded up, and sent somewhere else.</p>
<p>Though they obviously were not prepared for a long journey as my nomadic ancestors were, who were accustomed to long journeys from one pasture to the other, the Armenians died by the thousands on the way. Though their claim of...1 million, which sometimes becomes 2 millions and sometimes 1.5, is simply preposterous. There was a person in the US that wrote a book about how this "armenian genocide" was used as a means to deceive the American public to donate money. If anything, I can't deny that a lot of people died, but I simply am grateful that they're gone now. It was becoming obvious that we were not able to live together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now they have their own state, they enjoy a steady supply of diaspora-money, I don't know why they feel the need to appeal to the whole world for their national goals. I call them "national goals" because they want a portion of Turkey as part of reparations, and they know that they can't take it by force, but they don't have any diplomatic power either, so they appeal to western nations to force Turkey in ceding a portion of its territory to Armenia. In short, they're quite the dreamers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm all for ignoring Armenia in this matter. Our wish is not to re-instate the Ottoman empire, we want what you want. You want an Aryan empire, we want a Turanic Khanate.</p>
<p>And our intentions are nothing but peaceful and noble. We only wish to be left alone for us to prosper with our own kin, as we will have enough lebensraum and a wide landmass that has enough natural resources.</p>
