<p>Karate and other Asian stuff is mostly BS if you ask me. Martial arts ought to be simple and effective, with the emphasis being on sparring and real contact. That's why things like boxing and wrestling evolved, there was always a lot of sparring to correct mistakes and improve the art. Many of these Asian traditional martial arts failed miserably when  put to the test, the problem is that most people watch too many movies and think that these style is super-effective. Bruce Lee was smart enough to realize this and started practicing different martial arts, he was practically trying to evolve something like proto-MMA. Morons who train stuff like Karate, Kung Fu or Aikido would get beat by someone who has trained boxing for 3, 4 years easily, yet some of them don't realize this.</p>
