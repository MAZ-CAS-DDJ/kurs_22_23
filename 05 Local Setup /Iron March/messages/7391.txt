<p>Hello, comrade. I noticed your post in the Fascist Lifestyle thread regarding the potential creation of a Fascist Zine. I fully support this idea and, if you ultimately want to start it, I'm willing to assist in its creation and development. I have maintained different blogs at different times for several years now, and I---so I've been told---possess a great command of English; thus I could, for example, help with the design and editing in conjunction with the possibility of writing a few articles.</p>

<p>Hope to hear from you soon!</p>
