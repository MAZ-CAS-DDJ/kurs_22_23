<p>Blackshirt my friend, stop taking everything so literally. If you're interested in Paganism, more specifically German / Norse paganism, read the Poetic / prose Edda. I personally prefer poetic but prose isn't too bad, especially to start with. The Havamal is also a must, and it's relatively small and easy to read. For sagas, follow Hermann's advice. He's the master of the sagas and much better versed in them compared to myself.</p>
<p>Celts don't go to Valhalla exactly, but that's not to say they don't have their own equivalent. Valhalla isn't even a literal afterlife. We are born, we die, and we are reborn again. We are eternal. European paganism is one religion, and all of the European peoples share it, they just have their own myths and rituals to explain and worship it in a way that reflects their blood and culture. Celts are pretty close to Germanics though. </p>
