	No I meant dumb stuff like nothing ever gets done only by like 2 of the guys that are into their own philosophy the rest of the people here just mess around. Yeah I suppose if you take their word for it but lately I've been feeling like its just fancy ethnocentrism ,which they're trying to ignore and move around without making a big deal of the whole Hitler disliking slavs since a majority of people here float in between nationalism and not really fascism. Slavros is just into his Evola cult stuff which is basically pseudo religious stuff. But I think we need to just focus on saving Europe well our people , I've always wanted to go to Europe and be apart of my ancestors lands.

	Hermann told me all about his family yeah . No I live on the East coast way far away from him I only know him from here. But we talked a lot and were friends, he actually didn't want me telling you about the drugs, But I felt like that wasn't fair to you. I told him I let you know and he said he was going to tell you eventually. But I don't know yeah he gets his drugs from his friends and his mom let's him keep alcohol in the house illegally since here he would be underage. So I'm too sure where he can get help honestly he choose to do the drugs and it was mostly for his own fun and games not really to escape anything. Otherwise I don't think he would have been so open about it.
