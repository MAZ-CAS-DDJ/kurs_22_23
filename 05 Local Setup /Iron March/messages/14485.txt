	The internment camps were later supported by President Roosevelt actually, but yeah, they started independently. Earl Warren campaigned on interning Japanese immigrants, whose loyalty was considered suspect. The FBI actually confirmed that a lot were loyal to the Empire, but it's widely tarred today by liberals as just a wealth grab by jealous shopowners. Also by people on the radical right who are basically trying to say "see FDR had concentration camps too," which I have way more respect for because it's true.<br /><br />
	Maybe. Although the Puget Sound is also a hugely strategic location for build-up against Russia and is close to America's nuclear supply in Southeast Washington. You already had Air Force stuff in the Everett area because of Boeing, now the Navy has moved from San Francisco because Tacoma makes more sense as a location and also housing prices for those in the service are getting too high in the San Francisco area. But between the military migration to Tacoma, the tech boom in Seattle/Bellevue drawing a lot of Californians and Northeasterners, and Portland's rock-music trendiness right now also pulling in more of the "Golden Horde" from California... I think the urban PNW is going to look really different in a few decades and be far less insulated, and that's a shame.<br /><br />
	I blame Nirvana.
