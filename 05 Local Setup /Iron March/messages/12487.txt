That's a real shame. What I most liked about my old religion that even if you didn't believe exactly the same thing as your Catholic neighbour, you felt not only part of the same spiritual community, but of a physical one with concrete goals. Maybe you prefer to worship alone, but I've always found community a source of strength. ... Except if entirely made up of hippy weirdos, as it seems to be in your case.</p>

I accidentally pray a lot, but feel until I've done my research, I can't really commit to any beliefs. Don't want to incur the wrath of any gods. How do you tend to pray, and what's your stance on the existence of gods? Are you like some pagans and believe all religions' gods are present and manifestations of the same things? That's probably the most sensible identity to cling to, especially as German as belonging to one nation rather than a descriptor of peoples is quite a new concept anyway. And how did your upbringing affect your identity?</p>
