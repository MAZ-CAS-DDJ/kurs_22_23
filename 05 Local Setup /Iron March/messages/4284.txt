<p>Cool. And I'm quite fine with you moving away from the imperialist flavor of things with Reaktion. Prior to getting into Fascism I used to consider myself an American Imperialist, in the Theodore Roosevelt sense of it... Though I realized it was useless when the values of today's empire conflicted wildly with my own, and were all about globalism, capitalism, and liberalism. Even our military conquests, something often accused of Fascism, generally end up in being liberal-democracy clusterfucks fraught with corporate contracting scandals. That, and what kind of lifestyle would an "American Imperialist" have, when today's American values are completely confused and degenerate?</p>
<p>It was too much of a fantasy, and a lonely one at that, whereas Fascism, even if it didn't result in political change in the US, at least offered ideals to live by as a man even without a Fascist movement or state to march with. Which in a way, I think is how an American Fascist/Futurist is destined to be for now, kind of in the Old West tradition where the most daring men tended to strike out into Indian country to carve a living for themselves, their family, or their little clan. At the risk of sounding a little too Evolish, living as a Fascist man in the absence of a Fascist state is a worthy pursuit to me, while still doing your part to network with likeminded people.</p>
<p>So, that's one subject that interests me; exploring how the traditionally American idea of a Free Man is compatible with Fascism. "American Freedom" to me, rather than meaning "<em>I'm free to marry my poly triad fuckbuddies and have the state pay for my sex-change</em>", traditionally conjures up ideas of the wilderness-mastering pioneer, the rough &amp; tumble cowboy, Harleys with POW/MIA flags and riders with holstered pistols roaring across desert highways... Myth and icons that are inherently rebellious in the face of nanny-state pussy authority, championing bellicose masculine virtues that I see as being not only compatible with an American variant of Fascism, but absolutely ideal for it... Especially with Futurism thrown in there. Mind you, I come to Fascism as a military artist, so I do tend to see things in a subcultural light before I really have much interest in sitting down to write up a detailed plan with flowcharts on how I'd want to run a Fascist economy, when I'm more immediately concerned with letting the current one collapse. I suppose I'd make a better Squadrista than a statesman, in that sense. Like the famous commie-killer Chesty Puller said, "<em>I want to go where the guns are"</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, as far as what I plan to do with the artwork, what I have in mind is to make some militant anti-globalist, anti-materialist, anti-bourgeois, anti-capitalism posters which, at a quick/uneducated glance, would seem at home next to announcements for Anarchist demonstrations, SlutWalks, local hipster band events and such on your typical liberal art college's announcement board or coffee shop 'zine rack. But instead of it being the usual punk or Anarchist smashing icons of greed, it'd be more soldierly archetypes that convey a sense of duty and martial spirit, rather than heroizing some pansexual libertine in a hoodie and bandana.</p>
<p>You already had a few things in Reaktion that were in the general realm of what I'm pursuing, such as the "Will you be the face - OR WILL YOU BE THE BOOT?" image, which I utterly loved.</p>
<p>Reason for all this is that a portrait of Mussolini or a swastika will get it taken down in an instant by any offended passerby, and ultimately be just a waste of paper. But something just a little ambiguous (<em>and with enough graphic appeal</em>) might stay up longer. Even your average ANTIFA only knows to look for the ADL list of "hate symbols", and wouldn't immediately clue in to less well known symbols (<em>or even graphics of my own design, which I have a few of</em>).</p>
<p>I plan on distributing these around my home city (Richmond, VA), but if you're interested I'd be glad to submit some to Reaktion when I return to the US when I can do the finished illustrations.</p>
