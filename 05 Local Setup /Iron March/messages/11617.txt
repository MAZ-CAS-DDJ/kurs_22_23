<p>yeah, i noticed when i had a girl in my life it wasnt as common</p>
<p>i dont have really bad nightmares anymore but i used to, I had one as a little kid where a demon snake thing with my moms face was chasing me through a mountain pass trying to devour me</p>
<p> </p>
<p>my sleep paralysis  only happens after a good dream, i go to sleep in a pleasant normal dream, and wake up in the real world and the demons are there and i cant move</p>
