<p>Your comparison between Soviet socialism and German one is irrelevant. It is applied in different cultures. And if you want strictly to follow their model. you must abandoned the Islam and return to Zoroastrian religion then. The fact that your imams are not multicultural as other "global jihad" fuckheads is really nice. But setting religion as a state doctrine, and change your true culture with foreign one its not the smartest thing to do for your country and people..</p>
<p>I watched them Bosniaks and Albanians make fool of themselves copying arabs and turks, and im realy amazed how stupid one must be, to blindly follow some demented old foreign payed farts who tell them how to live their lives and what to do in their countries. And compare them to Tajik and Azers who preserved their culture and traditions..</p>
<p>Ok you defend your country against Americans that's fine. But what do you do if aggressor was not "Christian" state. It was Arabs, Turks, or Iranians? What then? You will declare jihad against them or just accept to be integrated in some greater Islamic state? What the majority of your kinsmen think about this?</p>
<p>P.S</p>
<p>I respect your people. Im not sure that you know this, but we are distant relatives. Our people came from Balkhara/Bactria some 2000 years ago. So im not hostile against you i even have sympathies. But im allergic toward any form of theocracy.</p>
