<p>Yes, you know, it's like "american" is a sort of "metapolitical" political item these days.</p>
<p>I guess we can simply nail it down to culture. Whatever they believe in is often hopelessly permeated by their own tinctures, so that even those who claim to be against most things american poltically still seem too american for me. Ussually.</p>
<p>I drew a few things from Strasser myself. I think that they should have listened to him.</p>
<p>You should go ahead and post on that thread anyways, to kick up some dust and force people to think.</p>
<p>I must ask, now that gassing has been mentioned, what do you think regarding Israel, and the Holocaust?</p>
<p>As for your own questions...</p>
<p>I stray away from Fascism in favor of Meritocracy for a simple reason. Fascism centralizes power upon one person, but I cannot trust that person to be any good. I'd only be a fascist in such a sense if *I* were the leader, or someone I know well and trust deeply. So a suitable alternative when a Leader is lacked could be a meritocracy. A meritocracy is somewhat similar to early greek democracy, or even to a spartan-like system even though sparta wasn't democratic. Basically, only the elite can vote, and anyone who's looking to get any rank or power is forced to prove that they deserve it through merit. Of course, "merit" can be an abstract thing, so it's tough to decide how it should be evaluated in modern society. "Democracy" could work with limited numbers, however, that's not democracy at all, but meritocracy if such a criteria is applied. But in everything else I roughly favor regular, good old fascism.</p>
<p>Prussian Socialism...well.</p>
<p>I see Prussia as a truly excellent role model for any country to follow, but being "Prussianist" would sound quite odd, and, besides, I don't favor an actual monarchy, so adding Socialism in sounded fine to my ears and to my logic.</p>
