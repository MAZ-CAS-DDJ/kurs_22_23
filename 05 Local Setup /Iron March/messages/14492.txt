	Yeah, that's what I love about the European right, it's something we've never managed to do as the British far-right has been bogged down by "We're just working class blokes" types like Tommy Robinson and the BNP. I mean we have RAC but that's just gigs in fields with old NF members and skinheads, I guess the original NF skinheads would be the far-right political subculture here, but they're just not around anymore. I do like the edge and I do love the memes, I hope Brexit leads to a political climate like what's in Italy.Â <br /><br />
	Now I gotta make sure my email is secure and the popo can't nab me.
