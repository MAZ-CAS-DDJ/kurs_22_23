	Both are war heroes from Balkan wars and WW1. However during WW2 they are very different. Milan unwillingly took a job as leader of new Serbian government under occupation to save innocent lives and later to battle communists. He had centralized rule and well armed and organized force. He realized the position Serbs found themselves in. Draža on the other hand didn't had a clue what danger Germans were, so he allowed himself to ally with communists and start a rebellion. He had no strong grip on his men and his armed forces. <br /><br />
	In short, I consider Milan a great martyr and hero, Draža as a senile traitor.
