<p>He doesn't have to read selectively, to the contrary he has to be read in full, the sperg/tism fanbase comes from people who read one, two books, don't get the point and then proceed to blabber bullshit. I've traced every kind of evolafag tendency to a criticism of said tendency by Evola, they're exactly the audience he criticized extensively - intellectuals/philosophers/no-fun tists and autists - combine that with what Hitler said on how people don't know how to read properly and you get the source of all the tist fanbase. Even here on our forum some people miss the mark completely, for one how they criticize his work Metaphysics of Sex as being "autistic" because they take it as some instruction as to the mundane, day to day relationship between the sexes, when its true point is the metaphysical relationship of the sexes that exists outside our daily interactions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He made an explicit point of how the subject matter of his books are not for all because the subject material is not for all and that is not something he came up with. Evola was foremost a researcher, something most people don't get, things he wrote about are not his invention or intellectual wank, it's research of ancient knowledge and translation of it into more comprehensible terms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another issue comes from the translations, english is primitive as fuck compared to most other languages and Evola could've been writing in a particular literary or stylistic style that is most likely a better read in Italian then when translated. There's always the obvious danger of just bad translation that could alter the original meaning (exactly why its important to read several works to clarify any possible confusion produced by a bad translation).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In terms of the order in which to read his books: most people just read his big trio - <strong>Revolt Against the Modern World</strong>, <strong>Men Among the Ruins</strong> and <strong>Ride the Tiger</strong>. I am only now learning that reading those first would be a mistake as you won't get their full benefit without reading his works that deal with spiritual, esoteric and transcendental matters, which are far more logical and science-like than what one would imagine from hearing those terms today.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As such I'd recommend starting with his spiritual works first. One of the most comprehensive ones is the Hermetic Tradition, however it is a very difficult read and takes actual effort to make sense of, but once you do, you will have a good point of reference for a lot of other things he wrote. I'd suggest reading his other spiritual works thereafter but you could, technically, proceed to the big trio right after the Hermetic Tradition. Otherwise I'd suggest first reading:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Mysteries of the Grail</strong> (could be a good start as a way of easing into the subject matter of the Hermetic Tradition, so you could read that first and then proceed to HT)<br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Introduction to Magic</strong> (a collection of articles, not just Evola's but it was his group that wrote them, this is to a large extent optional reading)<br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Meditations on the Peaks</strong> (somewhat optional, it gets you a good aesthetic vibe that surrounds the core, the essense of what Evola wrote about)<br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Doctrine of Awakening</strong> (reading this myself right now, it can be optional as well but this is one of the books you'd have to read after the Hermetic Tradition if you want to compare notes on the subject matter, one of its paths)<br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Yoga of Power </strong>(same as with the Doctrine of Awakening but it deals with the other path, or so I understood, I am still to read this one)</li>
</ul>
<p>After this you can read some intermediate materials that already deal with more down to earth subjects but from the platform of information covered in the spiritual works, so those would be:<br> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Metaphysics of Sex</strong><br> </li>
<li>
<strong>The Metaphysics of War</strong><br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Fascism viewed from the Right </strong>(to properly understand this one you have to keep in mind that whenever Evola speaks of Fascism he speaks specifically of Mussolini's regime which is not fascism in the context that we use on the forum foremost and which isn't the context in which I use the word in my initiation series - in light of that you can see how his criticism is valid from the viewpoint of fascism in our broader sense of the word)<br> </li>
<li>
<strong>Heathen Imperialism</strong> (this is probably the best preliminary read to get into the vibe and of Revolt Against the Modern World)</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these you'd have to dig around for the less known and not as wide-spread articles and smaller works, however most of those are not translated into english. You can find a good deal of them listed in my <a data-ipb="nomediaparse" href="http://slavros.tumblr.com/Library" rel="external nofollow">personal library page on my tumblr</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Only after reading some, if not all, of those would I suggest tackling the big trio in the order they were written in, namely <strong>Revolt</strong> <strong>Against the Modern World</strong> &gt;<strong> Men Among the Ruins</strong> &gt; <strong>Ride the Tiger.</strong> Mind you Evola also wrote a follow-up book to Ride the Tiger that tackles some other particular subjects - <strong>The Bow and Club</strong>, which is also an important read. You can also read his autobiography - <strong>The Path of Cinnabar</strong>, but I suggest saving that for the very last as it goes into the history of his writing so it would be good to know those books before you read how Evola came to write them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In terms of difficulty, the most exhausting reads are (<em>from most to least difficult</em>) The Hermetic Tradition, Ride the Tiger, Revolt Against the Modern World.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Heathen Imperialism</strong> is a breeze of a read as it was written in a sort of propagandish style that you can grasp quite easily ergo why its a good thing to read before you get into the hard theory behind it that is tackled in <strong>Revolt Against the Modern World.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you'd rather read the core minimum then I suggest going The Hermetic Tradition and Revolt Against the Modern World, Ride the Tiger - in that order.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you want the easiest read minimum then go with The Mysteries of the Grail, Heathen Imperialism and Men Among the Ruins - in that order.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All these nuances are exactly why I'm trying to read all (or at least all that I can get my hands on) of his works and then utilize them for my book, thus compressing the core principles into one book in the most comprehensive way, although it will be inherently a book for Fascists and not for the broad masses. That way people would only have to read one book instead of dealing with the full scope of Evola's work, not to mention that the existence of evolafaggotry proves how most people can't be expected to even attempt to draw the right conclusions from it if they blatantly miss Evola explicit criticism of the very things they then practice while citing his books.</p>
