	Okay I've read quite a bit on the forum already and I've read through the intro you sent and I have a GREAT understanding of iron March and it's mission. Ive read the entire history of white nationalism, and I'm a third of the way through Siege. When I posted in the facist section they locked my post. I just want to know what a facist is standing for. It makes zero sense to me for NS to be to the right of conservatives but there it is. Can you at least point me in the right piece of the intro material that may help me get a greater understanding of what it means to be a facist?
