<p>Banner; thinking same colour scheme as the profile picture. Thinking a few kings in there would fit it, in a ''line''. Gustav II Adolf, Karl XII and Gustav III.</p>

<p>And an ''end picture'' with space for a place where I can edit in a past video to place an annotation over to link there. You could add one of the kings there as well, behind a flag. Thinking Karl XII pointing at the video itself. Perhaps behind a flag? 1080p resolution would be optimal.</p>

<p>Another for the start. A 1080p version of the profile pic would do great there. Can add in the start of Sweden's anthem and make a nice quick intro out of that.</p>

<p>Don't feel any rush brah, greatful for this.</p>
