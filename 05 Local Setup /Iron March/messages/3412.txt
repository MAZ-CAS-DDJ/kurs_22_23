<p>I am not into the whole racialism/racist thing. I am not afraid to speak in racial terms (I fucking hate political correctness), but I don't think that is something relevant to my political outlook. (Most gringos don't even consider Cubanos White in the first place.) I basically consider myself an American nationalist above all.</p>
<p>Sorry not to respond in Espa√±ol, but I write it worse than I speak it. (Those of us born in the 305 call our language of choice Spanglish.)</p>
