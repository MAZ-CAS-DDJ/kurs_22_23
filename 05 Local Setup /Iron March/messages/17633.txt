	I don't believe in socialism as a economic system, that doesn't work on any large scale and various forms have been tried once under Lenin and again in its true anarchist variant in Spain. But I respect it as a ethical principle now. Human beings are not lone-wolves, we build are identity based on others and our collective history &amp; cooperation by a racial bias (racialism) which helps us forge our destiny. Perfectly natural but obviously the left isn't capable of doing that with their solutions, especially not materialist ones. Only the right-wing can rule or bring about a organic society. The left have unachievable goals even if some of it was on the right track.
