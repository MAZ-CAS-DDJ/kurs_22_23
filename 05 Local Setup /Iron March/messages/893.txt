<p>Hello, folks! A fellow from already-dead forum showed me IM, and I decided to join because I figured there might be people with similar views. So far it seems that it's indeed the case. Anyway, will try to keep this as brief as possible.</p>
<p>I am 18 years old Lithuanian. My political views are leaning closest towards nationalism and traditionalism.</p>
<p>My views are somewhat unpopular around here, because I support NATO and EU while at the same time stand against any kind of cooperation or political pacts with our big greedy Eastern neighbour. Unsurprisingly, this is not a wanted opinion in a land which hates both.</p>
<p>This person I choose as my avatar is Lithuanian general Povilas Plechaviƒçius. Best known for kicking Russians/Germans out of lowland region of Lithuania <span style="font-size:14px;">back in the WW1 days, and organising Lithuanian crewed and commanded defence force against russians during WW2, since nobody really wanted to join SS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">So that's that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Cheers.</span></p>
