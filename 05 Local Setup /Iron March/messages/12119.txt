<p>Hey Alex I've been working on an audio-book for A Squire's Trial, narrated by myself. It'll be complete in a few days. I'll upload as unlisted on youtube when it's done and send you the link. If you think its shit then no worries I'll delete it, but I'm just letting you know it's in the works and I will buy a copy when I can. I assumed you wouldn't have a problem with anyone turning it into an audio-book but if you do no worries again, I won't upload it anywhere. </p>
