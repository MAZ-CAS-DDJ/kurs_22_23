<p>Alright; thanks.</p>
<p>The reason I said Greater <span style="text-decoration:underline;">East</span> Asia is because Asia is generally divided into at least two zones, where you have the northern and central parts falling under the Russian sphere of influence and a few of the more western parts being more Arab. East Asia would include everything south of Mongolia and east of Afghanistan, which sort of define the limits of the East Asian cultural area.</p>
