<p>Most interesting my friend,</p>
<p>i was surprised to see the amount of socialists on the boards, while I am no capitalist, I view my country's own socialist tendencies as having gone too far (I am unaware 0f socialist policies in the Philippines however, in Canada, we have very much socialist tendencies)</p>
<p>We're perhaps Sweden, Denmark, and Norway lite when it comes to governmental economic policy and the Social Democrats have recently become the 2nd largest party in the Nation. However I believe some of the actions taken by our governmental leaders to be too far in the name of "equality''.</p>
<p>On another note though, I've noticed that the Philippine capital has recently recieved massive amounts of flooding,</p>
<p>Is your house in danger? Do you live with your parents?</p>
