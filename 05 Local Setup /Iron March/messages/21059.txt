	Czechoslovak identity was in original concept about to merge both nations in one. That concept was turned to Czechianization during interwar Czechoslovakia(While Slovaks were being Czechized (Lot of Slovaks were migrating to CP cause of hunger(literaly)(And starting speaking Czech there of course)(Kids in school were teached to speak and write Czech(Because it was valid by laws to teach Slovak or Czech "dialects" depending on what teacher prefers(Most of teachers were Czechs, so they naturaly prefered speaking Czech))),there were not Czechs being Slovakized).

	From what i heard it was wanted by T. G. Masaryk(Another freemason) during creating of treaties to join Czechoslovakia(Propably in Trianon treaty). It seems to me like he wanted to prevent it from remaining in Hungary, becoming part of Poland or independent(HavenÂ´t Horthy conquered it about one day after they declared independence?). Official standpoint of state was propably like:It is ours so we will earn money from it and defend it if necessary(Colony like Slovakia, but i dont know about Czechizing it)
