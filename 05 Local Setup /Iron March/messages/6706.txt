<p>Look kid, you came on a fascist website spreading a bunch of jibble that made you sound like a f*cking retard. People were annoyed with you since your first post. It's as simple as that. Nobody is trying to have a serious conversation with you, and that's why you're not getting any serious answers. They just want to shit post and have a little fun and some laughs before you inevitably get banned from the website. </p>
