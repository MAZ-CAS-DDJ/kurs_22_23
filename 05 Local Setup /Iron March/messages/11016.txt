<p>Alright so the guy I mentioned earlier? He signed into steam for the first time since his laptop was confiscated, from another computer.</p>
<p>It says its been accessed by his school laptop four times which is to be expected because it was searched, but it also said it has been accessed another 12 times from Colorado Springs, Denver, and Pennsylvania. Do you know any large government things going on in Pennsylvania? Homeland security, FBI, etc? Google isn't helping.</p>
<p>He's checking mine now, it only says its been logged into from my school laptop from one address thankfully. Steam has somewhere in the license agreement or something that a government official can access a steam account without user permission if necessary which means his is getting searched by some relatively superior people.</p>
<p>Not good.</p>
