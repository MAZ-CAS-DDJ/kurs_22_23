<p>I know many of you have probably read Erectus walks amongst us and of course there's a lot of speculation and interpretation through an evolutionary scope, but that is not to say there is no truth to the book at all, especially with regards to genetic distance, primitive traits and genetic recombination; not to mention the last few chapters of the book dealing with social policies.</p>

<p>This chapter in particular is what I want to raise with the people I'm sending this message out to. It seems the bible YET AGAIN has beaten the "evolutionists" and scientists to the punch with regards to taxonomy and wisdom with regards to being able to mix with species. The bible regards blacks as beasts, but it's only Christian Identity whom point this out; even kinists dance around this obvious issue, just choosing to ignore the points raised and which can be checked in the bible for themselves. Pastor Butler and Bertrand L. Comparet have dealt with this question in detail:</p>

<p>However, Pastor Allan Campbell does this research much more justice in the following sermon which I highly recommend you all to listen to, he touches on some small but very significant issues which both Butler and Comparet have missed, especially in regards to Exodus. He really puts it all into perspective, even teaching that these beasts do have souls and can be saved, but they have their different duties and positions and are not to be mixed with (as we all know if we've read the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, not to mention the command in Deuteronomy 23:2).</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that most niggers are utterly depraved to a much lower level than us that I barely have anything to do with them and think any and all efforts to try and save them is futile and is quite frankly a waste of my time, they are utterly hopeless, even more so since the fire has been stoked by Jewish agitators. Altruism and chivalry is a meaningless concept to the nigger with "freedom".</p>
<p>So where do we come from? The simple answer is Adam. Genesis 1:26-28 and Genesis 2:7-8 seems to suggest that God took Adam from an ALREADY CREATED white race (Genesis 1:26-28) in order to mold Adam in to a higher being of that race (Genesis 2:7-8). I believe that Adam was taken from the people we now know of as the Cro-Magnons. I find this explanation to be very plausible and keeping with undeniable scientific and historic evidence. A similar position and some interesting food for thought concerning this has been posted here:</p>

<p>Distinguishing between beasts (quadruped) and beasts (biped) presents us a great deal of truth. If this truth were more widely known I think it would stop the mad race towards mongrelization and stop the mindset of egalitarianism dead in its tracks in the mind of most people.</p>
<p>I'm preaching to the converted but I feel it is good to hammer the nail in a little bit further for extra security.</p>
