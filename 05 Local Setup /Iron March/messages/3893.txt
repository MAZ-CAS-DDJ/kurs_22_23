<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>I forgot to follow up on this.</p>
<p>I will absolutely forward funds when I settle into a new job, rebuild my brakes and pay my taxes.  Taxes weren't withheld from my paychecks so I have run up a tab.</p>
<p>I hope IM gets a plan in place for when publishers come after the site for pirating their content.  I would imagine you might even insulate yourself from the site operation to some degree, since I assume you are operating online under your real name.  If I remember right Slavros is handling finances so you are already a step ahead on this.  I'd assume this would affect hosting  but what do I know.</p>
