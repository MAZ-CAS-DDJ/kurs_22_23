	Hey. So, as Noidberg just pointed out to me the version of <em>On War </em>that I have is apparently an abridged version. I did not know that before because the website I bought it on did not say that it was an abridged version. Now, with that being said I am almost done reading it and will finish it anyways since I have come this far. Still interested in my thoughts/recommendation of the book? Let me know what you think/if you are still interested.
