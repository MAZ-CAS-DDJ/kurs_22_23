I going to put my ideas into action, the riots in Baltimore, made me realize that unless I and a group of people control these Afro-Americans, we'll end up eventually be in a losing race war that I do not wish to ignite, I apologize for these Africans niggerism and I would hope to achieve something by the time I'm thirty. I also hope when I do create a political party, I hope to make a pact with other Asian nationalist parties. I do not expect to comment on this site for a long time, not until I better understand fascism, nationalism, race, eugenic, culture, economics and religion. I hope if you live in New York City, we could meet up and discuss a plan. Or if not I just email you and go from there.</p></div></div></blockquote>
