	Hello, I seem to recall reading a post that you are originally from The Ivory Coast, but are currently living in Europe. What's that like, if you don't mind me asking? What are your thoughts on non-European immigrants in Europe in general? Do any of them think like you do?<br /><br />
	BTW, you always have great posts. Love reading 'em.
