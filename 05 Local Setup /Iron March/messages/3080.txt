<p>Whoever told you was told by Aristocrat. I don't really care, I just laugh at how autistic the ideas that you, and the other "safe-fascists", promote. I can treat people nicely, I am just tired of the same autistic "safe-fascist" shit being promoted year after year, decade after decade. Don't whine and cry about not being a nazi, you don't have to call yourself one(I don't outside of jokes, like Vlad said, I fit into the 1st National-Syndicalist group), but don't fucking cry about it. Crying about it just attracts new rightists, and they are fucking retarded. I don't want National-Anarchist ideals in Fascism, nor does anyone with a brain.</p>
<p>My movement doesn't have much other than just a core basis, mostly using Vlad's work right now while working on my own. I don't have an issue with you other than this stupid safe-fascist shit, it's fucking cowardly. Crying about not being  a nazi is what trotscum do with Stalinists, it's weak.  We joke, because that's what the forum is about. We're literally, as Ben said, "4chon with usernames".</p>
