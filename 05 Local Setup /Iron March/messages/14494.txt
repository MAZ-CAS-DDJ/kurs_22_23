			I meant for migrant workers during the Great Depression, not the Japanese internment camps. California in the Great Depression was pretty interesting, some predicted if the Depression got worse, California might try to secede. Of course with the New Deals and FDR that never happened.<br /><br />

	Oh, I hadn't heard about that. California then was kind of what the PNW is now, the most recently-settled edge of what people think of as "America." (Nobody thinks much about Alaska, and Hawaii might as well be a foreign country.) So, secessionist tendencies kinda make sense, and California was a pretty conservative state back then. It would have probably been a good thing.<br /><br />
	We mostly blame Cobain, yeah. We don't actually want to be on the pop culture map, we want to be left alone. :P And with the tech boom, Seattle's black population is getting priced out into Tacoma. Tacompton's a pretty common phrase. Though with the Navy boom even those are getting priced out, usually they follow the other black people to Atlanta. It has its nice areas, my mother's family is from around there. Mostly kind of dumpy though.
