<p>Blackshirt 13,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We can just continue our discussion from here, and in doing so I will attempt to check IM more frequently; this week has just been very hectic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>May I ask, how (and why) did you casually mention to your professors that you're a fascist? Or what gave it away IRL? I'm just generally curious how this conversation went down.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What philosophers, apart from Nietzsche, do you like? And what interests you about <em>The Will to Power</em>? Do you think philosophy is a pre-requsite for political action? Do you have any specific topics you think about often? What is a nagging question that you have? What ideas keep you up at night?<br /><br />Additionally, I will get into the habit of checking more regularly; as I said, this week has been very busy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regardless, I look forward to the next message! And you needn't worry too much about the formality, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p> </p>
