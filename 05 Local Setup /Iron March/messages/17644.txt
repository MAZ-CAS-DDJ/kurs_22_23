	I have a lot of Fascist friends in the Army. They say there are a lot of "Red-pilled" Soldiers due to the fact that major bases like Fort Bragg are infested with Niggers. Also what unit are you attached to? I know Lt Col. Liston in 2nd LAR based in Lejeune. That guy gave me a lot of advice before I joined.
