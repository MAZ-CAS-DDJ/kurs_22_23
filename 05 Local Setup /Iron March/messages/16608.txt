	Ive had a long day. Work has been stressful, so my heads all over the place today. I'll take a second look at the thread.<br /><br />
	So ideally operating in a similar fashion to national action in Britain? Acting as a brotherhood,  to foster a sense of community between australian fascists, and to advance our goals in this part of the world?<br /><br />
	Yeh. I'm attempting to gather a rough idea of what the group intentions are, priorities, etc.  I saw your post that mentioned the postering at a Uni during a pride parade or something, which i definitely found amusing. As its a youth based group, i imagine University orientated activism would be high up on your list of targets.<br /><br />
	Couple of questions.<br /><br />
	Where do you have chapters?  I am currently in Tasmania, so i highly doubt you guys have spread down here.  Just in Melbourne at the moment?<br /><br />
	Do you have a facebook page/blog/web page to look at?

	Edit:  I went back to the post and double read it, and like the sound of it.  Would definitely be up for discussing it further if you're willing. Always looking to network and get to know more Australia based fascists.  God knows we need all the connections we can get.<br /><br />
	Anyway. I am going to get some shut eye so i wont reply til tomorrow. Though at this late of an hour, i imagine your asleep too anyway.<br />
