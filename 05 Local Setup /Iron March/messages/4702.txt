<p>Hey hey. Been a while huh? Whaddya been up to?</p>
<p>Yeah, you could say that. Summer break. Blazing it. Taking it easy right now and chilling, trying to come up with something to do. So, in other words, nothing new under the sun. Could take a couple of panacods and hit the bar with a mate, lived in semi-seclusion for a week in friend's place. Been pretty fun though. Called Ironmarch's admin high on shrooms as well, lel.</p>
