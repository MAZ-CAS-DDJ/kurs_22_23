<p>Yeah, he is American_Blackshirt.</p>
<p>Do you have Skype?  We'd like to work on spoken and written Afrikaans.  We probably won't be able to do any skype sessions for a bit because AB's computer died.  That being said, he is making it a priority to get a new computer, so it shouldn't be more than a week.</p>
<p>AB and I have just started with week one on that syllabus, so we have a pretty good grasp on basic pronunciation, the pronouns, months, colors, and days.  I'd say in the next week or two (he works and I am about to start two jobs, so we are taking this a little slow) we can start writing simple sentences to each other.  Hopefully, it won't be too long after that before we can start skype sessions and really get things going.  Does this sound like a good plan or would you like to jump in later since you know a lot more Afrikaans than we do?</p>
