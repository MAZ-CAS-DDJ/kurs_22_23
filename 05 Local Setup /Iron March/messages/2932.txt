What's happening there is that Solomon has completely rejected God and is handing himself completely over to paganism (which I argue modern christianity is - but that is a seperate issue) - modern ecumenism is different.</div></blockquote>
<p>I don't think Solomon was an outright apostate, just led astray. He went AWOL, but he wasn't a deserter. Many ecumenicalists also have an unhealthy interest in the occult, but you may be right in that being a case of one person engaging in two evils.</p>

<p>Sounds a lot like GK Chesterton's observations that men do not differ much about what things they will call evils; they differ enormously about what evils they will call excusable.</p>

<p>Not just the Catholics. Lots of others want to see all the churches unified under one central organization. There ain't that much difference now that we're all about equally depraved, and it might help prevent extremism.</p>
<p>Though I've often felt that few reformers went far enough. They were correct in saying that the men in Rome were not the personal messengers of Heaven, but they fail in saying that men in London or Geneva (or, heck, Loma Linda) were.</p>

<p>So not cousins, but possibly fellow travelers. That makes sense.</p>

<p>Of course, I desire for only one 'denomination' of christianity to exist - the words from Ephesians ring in my ears</p>
<p>"There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 6 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."</p>
<p>But of course, we are told many will claim to be the true faith - but are simply pawns of the Devil.</p>
<p>"For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect--if that were possible."</p>
<p>" For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 14 And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 15 It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve."</p>
<p>"But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought themâ€”bringing swift destruction on themselves. 2 Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. 3 In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping."</p>
<p>etc.</p>

<p>Another pertinent verse might be the words of Jesus Christ himself: Luke 9:49-50. When it came to other denominations, I would often point out to my Baptist pastors that different does not necessarily mean wrong, and wrong does not necessarily mean Damned Wrong (Baptist pastors don't seem to like me much).</p>
