	Well, if you have charisma you should be able to help steer them in a right direction. Basically, you should advocate for doing the right thing, and either the group will follow, or maybe some will follow your lead and the group will split. Or the group will just have some people doing IE type stuff while other do your kind of stuff. There doesn't necessarily need to be a coherent branding for everyone in the group. You can have two separate brands doing separate types of stuff, even though you're all friends who meet up for beers on the weekend or whatever.<br /><br />
	You can propose doing a certain activity, and a subset of the large group will follow you with that.<br /><br />
	Over time, things should become more organized and disciplined, but it takes time for the bonds between people to form.
