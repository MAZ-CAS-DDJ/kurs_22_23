<p>Im not register here to harras other organizations just tell it to you in privet conversation and i dont want to make them favour by atack them wich will consolidate their anti-Bulgarian views it is not the right moment for that and in those changing and troubled times you dont know whit who you will be forced to ally. Here in Balkans the " National question" is a bit of painfull question for all nations here wars are waged to complete oblitteration of others and are long bloody and exosting and i have no energy to wage it in internet if you know what i mean. So i wish them luck but i know how the things will end in every posible way <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> it is not be for first and will not be the last time...</p>
