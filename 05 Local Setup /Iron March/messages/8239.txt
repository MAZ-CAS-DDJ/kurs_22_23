<p>Thanks mate, I've never really engaged in any other activism beside leafleting letterbox's, which you know is pretty worthless as you don't know exactly who your targeting and if they'll even read it before discarding in the bin.... </p>
<p>Stencils at least stick around and are harder to avoid and I'd like to get a feel for it before engaging in broader activism in the city.</p>
<p>5 bucks won't even buy you a pint at a pub here mate so make it 10 and I'd at least feel like I'm shouting you a beer for your work haha, I'd like to think we could arrange further ventures if you were willing as it'd benefit us to have well done designs and it seems hard to find people who are competent enough in that field. Anyway I have paypal and can sort out that no worries, money's not a problem...</p>
<p>Basically just want to start out nice and easy, VAN TONGEREN WAS RIGHT, with a Celtic Cross motif in the centre would rustle some feathers here in the west, his NS propaganda campaigns in the 90's struck fear into a lot of the immigrant population &amp; the liberal political establishment, he was a based fascist. </p>
<p>Also was thinking about making an Ironmarch stencil with a bit of an Aussie cultural twist in the vein of how Zentropista seems to be able to mold modern culture and turn it upon itself but I am unsure whether Slavros would care as to whether or not the websites name would be used without permission. Anyway I'd propose in capitals DILLIGAF? (do I look like I give a fuck), as an Aussie nod to Me Ne Frego with a fasces and than the website at the bottom... If any of that sounds un realistic or too vague let us know.</p>
<p>Thanks m8! I've not met many Americans, loads of Canadians and they seem like decent people, like our new zealanders, slightly feminine counter-folk haha <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" />  I'm pretty optimistic about our people, we have the pitfalls of a lot of western nations but seemingly are in a much healthier position than you guys, true Mericans are our brothers and it's sad as fuck to see what's happening there, we share a common bond in the struggle we wage, keep up the Stella work mate! </p>
<p>Cheers</p>
