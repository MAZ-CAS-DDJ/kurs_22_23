<p>As someone who used to do a lot of carding and put the funds towards chemicals for meth I can tell you it's easy as hell to make a profit if you sell it to even just a few select people. This is what gangs like Public enemy number one in the US do. Steroids are another personally useful niche and have a popular market also. Infact I'd probably recommend steroid dealing to meth dealing.</p>

<p>^ pretty hard to follow if you're not into chemistry and some of the stuff's hard to get ahold of, it's good for looking at for ideas though. There are more easy to follow guides on the internet, probably as many on steroids as there is on amphetamines.</p>

<p>Like you said in that thread on fascist occupations a 9-5 is for teenagers, niggers and single and bitter women. A man has a career or a job but his main money maker is his hobby, which can be welding, chemistry, energy, petrochemistry, building etc. no respectable fascist should be delivering pizzas, sitting in a cubicle or stacking shelves. We need our own people to do those jobs obviously but we're too smart for it, the lemmings are necessary for those jobs until we efficiently get useful technology in place.</p>

<p>One thing you certainly need to look into are offshore banks. Stay away from Switzerland and the Cayman Islands; trust me on that.</p>

<p>It should go without saying that your computer of choice should be a laptop; it's portable, easy to hide and easy to destroy if ever you need to. You can wardrive with a laptop too, they're just more convenient.</p>
