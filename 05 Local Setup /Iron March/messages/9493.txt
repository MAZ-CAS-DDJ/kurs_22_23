<p>Definitely goals. Don't forget what I said before <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>Was it nice?</p>
<p>I had the most incredible evening to make up for my shitty day. This old guy (82 years) who's a really good friend of my dad's gf was over for dinner, he's a dentist and a member of the local german society. We have pretty much the same view on everything even though he calls himself libertarian, and upon finding this out we proceeded to demolish all the lies about Germany, revealed the injustice of Versailles, the lies about Hitler, and we talked about Soviet atrocities, terrorbombing, and how there were no gas chambers. I went further and talked about Leon Degrelle, how National Socialism is a truly pan-European vision, etc.</p>
<p>My dad and his gf basically conceded to us, it was so fucking ebin. My dad doesn't even seem to disagree, his gf was like "well all the sides were bad, war is bad etc etc." </p>
<p>Massive FVCKING victory</p>
<p>Edit: He invited me to help organize a commemoration of WWI Uboot submariners who were interned in Baltimore next year when I'm back from Deutschland. He says I can bring my Imperial Reichkriegesflagge</p>
<p>And my dad is casually liberal, a mix of proletarian loyalty to the democrats and stuff he picks up from friends, like not seeing much wrong with faggots for example</p>
