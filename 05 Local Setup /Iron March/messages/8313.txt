<p>Hi! If you are outside of Europe you can go to the following address: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/olena.semenyaka" rel="external nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/olena.semenyaka</a></p>
<p>She is the person I was coordinating with. However everyone should have gone to Ukraine a month ago, I'm not sure if she can still help.</p>
<p>If you are in Europe you can also email Gaston Besson and ask about joining Azov battalion. gastonbesson@yahoo.com</p>
