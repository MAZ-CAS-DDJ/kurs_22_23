<br /><p style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">I'm not really knowledgeable on him, though I'll read up on him more and get back to you later.</p>

<br /><p style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">- Mao</p>
<br /><p style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">Even when I was a communist I was opposed to Mao ( I was a hoxhaist ). Mao did nothing except overthrow a corrupt leader--and that's all he should be accredited like that, he was not a saviour of China or even a good theorist. </p>

<br /><p style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">A good leader during the hitlerite invasion of the Soviet Union, and industrialized the SU rapidly, that's what he is responsible, and that's what I credit him with.</p>

<br /><p style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">- Both Mussolini and Hitler (just wondering your opinion on Hitler since you seem to identify more with Strasser, and i wanted to get your opinion on the man who created fascism as well)</p>
<br /><p style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">Benito Mussolini was a decent leader until the later years of his rule when he started behaving more irradically and allied himself with Hitlerite Germany in its advocation of European Civil War which is a negative thing both for the European Peoples and for the world--it led to many negative things. Instead of doing this he should have allied Italy with the rest of Europe against the Red Horde. The Hitlerite war led to the accession of the Soviet Union to the status of a world power. Hitler I view in a negative light obviously, he started and advocated civil war between Europeans, supported the reactionaries, and overall abandoned the entire reasoning behind National Socialism.</p>

<br /><p style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">I'm neutrtal in this respect, I have no opinions in one direction or another.</p>
