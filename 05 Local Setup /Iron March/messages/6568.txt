<p>    More-so then not having a Fascist tradition, there really isn't even much of a national tradition. The only real solution to that for us Americans is to completely disengage from the internet fascism and only utilize the internet in the service of living out a fascist world-view in our day to day lives. That is the only way we could develop some cultural terrain that a political party could take traction on.</p>
<p>  Vlad is certainly pretty young, but he has been on this site for a few years, I'm pretty sure that the guy who runs this forum is about as old as him. I'm almost 25, and I've only recently arrived at this worldview maybe 3 years ago. But the little more life experience I have has helped me not be so immature about these ideas. Its pretty funny reading all the posts in the drug thread thats been going, since I basically used the same arguments when I was a raging leftist to justify all the raving I used to do.</p>
<p> But yeah, I'm pretty sure you're one of the few people here who has actually lived out your worldview, I'm usually too afraid to be open about my views since I work with almost all blacks since I moved to the south.</p>
