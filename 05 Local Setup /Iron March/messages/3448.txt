<p>I said the *end* of December, remember? I need at least 4 more days to change some money in my accounts around and have my boy help set me up one of those PayPal thingamabobers so I can actually send the money to you. He'll be coming home from his mother's house on Friday to help me out in doing that. Hell, I'll even throw in an extra $150 if you give me til the 31st, so some of my checks have time to clear.</p>
