<p>Ok, I lied. This idiot was everything in my life for the last few years and apparently I can't stop talking about it.</p>

<p>Do you have any particular song that reminds you of... yours? I don't even know what genre you'd call this weird thing, but she played it for me on the first day we met. I used to love it because of good memories, now I can't hear it at all (I couldn't even listen to a second of it while copy-pasting it here)</p>

<p>I think it's one of the more popular songs for goth weirdos.</p>

<p>I needed her to help me I guess, like you talked about? Well, not help per-se. I'm not sure how to explain, but I felt complete and normal when I was with her, and I was motivated to do shit. I had a plan to move, and to get a job, and all that stuff. Now shes gone, I have no idea what I'm doing. I don't give a fuck about myself, society or anything else, really. All I want to do is take care of my wife and kids, except I don't have a wife and kids. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>What does Ms. Radic like to do for fun, when she isn't stealing vaccum cleaners or brainwashing children?</p>
