<p>We haven't talked enough this year at all. I miss you so much and want to remind you that you are my best friend and comrade, and I will easily take a bullet to my head while on my knees still screaming "Heil Fuhrer Raymond!". I can't wait to come to England and be with you again and with National Action.</p>
