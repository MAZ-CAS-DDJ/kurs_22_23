<p>Understandable, but aren't you afraid that such isolation will alienate the officer from the enlisted man who in this state is probably just putting in his five years and fairly in touch with the civilian world?  I ask this because I knew a West Point cadet that dropped out after 9/11 because he wouldn't wait to serve his nation, and he said that WP cadets spend so much time and energy on life at WP that they have some trouble connecting with the common solider.</p>
<p>Doesn't the citizenship elect the multi-headed executive?  Therefore, if the citizenship was disproportionately military, the citizens would elect disproportionately military executives, and then the military could end up being disproportionately favored.  I agree that the elite must govern, but we musn't make the mistake of simple promoting a class.  The best of each class must comprise the citizenship to assure that the nation's needs are addressed.</p>
<p>I understand this may seem like splitting hairs, but could you provide a certain argument or claim by Chomsky that would be across the pale in your system?  I would say that what he does is policy criticism.  He doesn't really mock the nation like a Bill Maher or some other comedians.  I guess the long and short of it is: would questioning the legitimacy of the state be acceptable speech in your system?</p>
