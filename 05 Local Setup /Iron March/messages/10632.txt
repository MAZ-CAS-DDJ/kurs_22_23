<p>Ah if you're doing it online then you can import from china, they can manufacture them for seriously low costs... Look on ali baba or ali express, they have loads under custom sticker printing, then just contact the manufacturers, and send them your designs. That is if you feel right buying from the Chinese. Also check out eBay for Australian manufacturers, a lot of them operate making counterfeit logos for clothing and whatnot so will be more than happy to print anything.</p>

<p>Like I said in the article, the guys i was buying from are left leaning and it would be no good manufacturing far right propaganda through them.... </p>

<p>If I find a good British manufacturer I can let you know, as I know bulk manufacture and orders are cheaper, and if the price sounds good to you i can knock yours on top, then dispatch directly to you, if you'd prefer that to ordering from the chinese... </p>

<p>Thanks</p>
