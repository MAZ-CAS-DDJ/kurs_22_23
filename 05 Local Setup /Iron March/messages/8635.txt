<p>Yeah they do, My father always goes on about how much he liked Panama when he was stationed their, then again this was int 70's when the Canal was still ours and before Noriega and the invasion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What'd id study would depend on what they have which is what im trying to figure out, but ideally</p>
<p>Literature</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>Political Science</p>
<p>Film,Music, Game Production</p>
<p>Web design,Graphic design etc. bunch of computer stuf i don't understand but would like too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Essentially i'd like to learn how to run a Production company for a variety of differant media for the cause of Nationalism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wouldn't mind Being a Historian or a Writer either, a lot of people i know think i should be a history teacher, but eh, couldn't bear the thought of lying to kids about WW2 and it'd be either that or lose my job.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also that's pretty sweet. alwasy thought it'd be awesome to just have a private little prop plane and just fly to wherever the hell i want and take in the view.</p>
