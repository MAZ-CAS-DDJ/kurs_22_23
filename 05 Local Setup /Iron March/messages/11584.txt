<p>A ball, blue-ish (well the whole view was blue-ish) ''fuzzy''. I saw from the view of this ball and was in a small castle of sandstone. While I was in the material world still, knowing that ''I was I'', I was somewhere else in ''the soul'' if that makes sense. Again, this was before I went to IM and before I even considered being fascist. All this came afterwards. Not going to go into too many details but it was not a pleasant experiance. This happened as I tried meditation for the first time. Was quite unsure what to make of it at first. I would not be too worried about it being satanic. Impressions from the higher would be reasonable. Perhaps disorderly and hard to understand.</p>

<p>What's ''AP'' tho?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How did you feel when it happened?</p>

<p>AP means Astral Projection. Astral Projection is another kind of meditation where you induce yourself into a trance and then mentally "push" your "soul" out of your body and fly around the place and do stuff until you "return" to your body. It may most likely just be a hallucination but there is absolutely no doubt that it is something very sinister, dangerous and wrong about it. You shouldn't it.</p>
<p>How did I feel? I felt very light weight and like I was spinning around the room. It was a very short experience. I floated for about half a minute and tried to makeout what the figure was but I fell back into my body because I was tired and my consciousness was getting dimer/sleepier.</p>
<p>But I am serious, Keep yourself away from AP and please don't ever try it., just leave it to the occult nuts. All over the internet and magazines they praise it some harmless experience but in reality people have died from low heart rate during the experience and/or become seriously mentally il or develop a stroke from trying this (one of my friend's mother).</p>
<p>Plus, It's addicting, like a drug, and it subtly over time makes you into hedonistic and materialistic person, and their are temptations like this extremely dangerous "astral sex" succubus hallucinations which are too hard a temptation for a material human mind like ours to resist. I had a near death experiences by trying this with so I'd suggest its best you don't even bother googling on how to AP. There is definitely something evil in this and has the devil behind this otherwise the Bible and my conscience wouldn't warn me about magick or these retarded hippie occult practices like AP.</p>
<p>But if you are curious with these hallucinations and stuff and want to try one that is safe and not satanic in any measure, I recommend you try lucid dreaming (aka fully controlling your dreams at when you sleep night) it's pretty fun and you can fly around and do all sorts of dream stuff. But these tend to be addicting and abused for pleasure so you like with everything new please be careful. Take care.</p>
