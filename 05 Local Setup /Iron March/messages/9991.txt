For me the usage of "reactionary" as an insult gave away the roots of the system. Same anti human bullshit they pulled a century ago but now financed by raping the working people with taxes to produce worthless trash to have as followers. It is a vicious circle. Not to mention by killing of the spirit of work and effort they are making entitled scum who will make crap life decisions and want to be bailed out by the government.</span></p>

These people are born losers who want everybody to suffer for their feel good mantra. Not even the catholic Church was this dogmatic back in the day.</span></p>

<p>Learning a trade is a smart idea. Unless you go for some STEM degree in engineering etc you might not have a place to go combined with the ever popular student loans that you pay for a long time. It is a decision based on your financial situation and job market.</p>

<p>I am neutral about the future. But looking forward to what will happen. It sure won't be boring.</p>
