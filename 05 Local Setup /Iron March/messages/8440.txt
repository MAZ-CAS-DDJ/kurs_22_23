<p>I am pretty sure that TEFL alone is enough, and I think you can even land gigs (though not as good) with only a college degree that is (1) from an anglophone country or (2) from Korea. </p>

<p>I live in South Korea and am a Master's Degree student and I teach English on the side. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, the more TEFL/CELTA stuff you have the better chance of landing a better job. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>One should always be a bit careful where they teach. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, be aware that if you are not teaching in Seoul, you'll perhaps be able to land slightly better benefits/pay for that, as the demand for Seoul is greater. </p>
