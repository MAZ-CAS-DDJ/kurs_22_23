<p>Hello, I have read your 'A Time to Kill' thread, and I really enjoy reading your posts. You're a very smart man, you know much more about the bible than I. However, I am rather conflicted at the current moment. If I understand correctly, you're a White supremacist, or at least for a White Europe, correct? You see, I'm a Catholic, yet I'm White. I too, believe in White nationalism, and the preservation of a White Europe (even though I live in America). However, I'm rather confused, as Catholics (and Christians in general), believe we are all children of God. If we are to convert other races to Christianity, are they no longer our enemy? How are we to hate, exterminate, and deport minorities if they are Christian, yet live in our land? Does it contradict our beliefs? Sorry to bother you, I just really need an answer to this question, and you're the only person on here that I could think of that would have an answer (you being Christian and a biblical scholar, so to speak). I really thank you for your time, and God bless.</p>
