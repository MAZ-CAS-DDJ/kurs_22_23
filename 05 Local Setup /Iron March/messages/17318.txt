	Well, you can easily look that up from the sources of the specific religions. Fascism stands for Order, thus for hierarchy and organization as a whole. These can be corrupted, just like anything else in this world, but this fact is not an argument against them; since there is no alternative. Every religion tried to organize, to establish a system of legitimacy which would ensure the survival of its essence.

			Christianity bothers me because the Holy Texts are all Jewish, even the New Testament, as it was written by Jewish followers of, mainly, Paul the Apostle. I studied it quite a bit, and even if he didn't knowingly set up the Christian dogmas, he influenced all other who listened to him, as he was quite important, and so the bible is not the word of God, but of YHWH.

<p>
	Not all the Holy Texts are Jewish. Jesus knew Paul, and He founded the Church, making Peter its leader, thus if you accept Jesus as God manifest in the flesh, then you have to trust in Him as well as in His decisions. That's something what I haven't done yet - I am not a Christian, but I see Christianity as a way to God, thus I have a deep respect for it. I feel the same respect for every Traditional religions, the reason because I am constantly attacking neo-Pagans is because they claim to have a religion and they just don't (those who do I simply call Pagans). In the end you have to accept something as an axiom, and you will find the most primal one in the Tetragrammaton.

	This is not necessarily a problem if you are humble enough to see it as a deficit of yours. Your last words were about self-improvement. Learn then; you literally can't find a better place for this than IronMarch. Rationality is what we can more or less grasp by default, but it has to originate from somewhere else. Studying physical cosmology and comparing it withÂ  philosopical/religious ideals and Traditional symbolism helped me a lot in this. About Bible as not a "European" thing: Truth is universal. It is true that before Christianity, different people all had different religions, and these also were manifestations of Truth; but disappeared for a reason. Those weren't institutionalized religions, but rather mysteries for different groups of peoples, who were slowly becoming unable to understand the old teachings, while Christianity was the first mass religion, and this is the age of the masses. The sword is a symbol of a more noble era, but fighting with it today would be a foolish thing to do.

	Jesus, as a human was a Jew, but as a God He wasn't. The same applies to Christianity. Of course it was founded by people with Jewish blood, but it was exactly the rejection of the Jewish spirit - which was all about the blood. The funny thing is that back then the Jews argued against the Christians the same way as neo-Pagans are arguing now.

	Blood/family/nation/humanity are not ends, but means - all of those are processes towards something, which transcends them, where they are originated from. If the tales of your ancestors are helpful in getting closer to the source then you should preserve them and hand them down to your descendants; but if you can't read or understand them anymore, then you have to find another way. "Don't follow your ancestors, but the same thing they have followed" - as one of our Nationalists said.

<p>
	No. We are talking about the 'Primordial Tradition', or the 'Metaphysical Tradition', in the Evolian sense. Those have nothing to do with humanity, those are coming from the same source as the laws of Nature, or Existence itself.

	It's not about its age, but its essence: the ideals of historical Fascism for example were much more closer to the laws of Nature then those of Protestantism.
