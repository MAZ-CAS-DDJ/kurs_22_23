<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Hello Alex, just wanted to know if there are any available positions in the Propaganda Ministry, I really like the idea of this site bringing Fascists and nationalists alike, from all over the globe, to this group. I think, as you say, it could be the Fascist equivalent of RevLeft or Stormfront. and before I even knew about this section of the group, I did a fair amount of advertising on Nationalist videos on YouTube, messaged a few friends of mine to put a link to the site in the description, and even told a large amount of people at my collage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">I'm not expecting anything illustrious, especially considering us "getting off on the wrong foot" the other day, for which I sincerely apologise, but if there is a minor position available, I would be more than happy to take it, advertising in my local area and over the internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">I think the more the merrier eh? If we got 10 people to get 10 people to join, we would've more than doubled the membership already! and if that kept happening, we'd be on our way to 10,000 (RevLeft's membership count),</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Well, please consider my offer and I look forward to your reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Thanks, Ben Barton.</span></p>
