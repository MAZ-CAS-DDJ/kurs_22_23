<p>I've never properly studied Nietzsche, but I cannot see any parallels between his work and the traditional catholic worldview - he criticised Christianity at every turn. His view that morality is non-existent clashes with catholicism. His thinking is in line with that of a rebellious 13 year old atheist, and i've never seen anything cathotrad about his philosophy, especially seeing as he rejected nationalism - a very christian idea - "And (God) hath made of one, all mankind, to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, determining appointed times, and the limits of their habitation." (Acts 17:26).</p>

<p>I'm no expert, and I still have much to learn, but that's what i'd say about Nietzsche.</p>
