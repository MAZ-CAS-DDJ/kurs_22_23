<p>Hey there buddy. Best method is to get a drinks bottle of some sort (often the lucozade sport ones are good, as they squirt well) and a brush or sponge or rag or something to spread it around with. Get that on the wall, spread it poster size, put on the poster and if you've put enough on it'll hold there. Then put a little more paste over it, spread around with your hands (gloves!) or brush to ensure it is stuck firmly, and bugger off to do the next one. There's a thread on it here on libcom, the anarchos have a discussion going it has a few other ideas and tips on it</p>
