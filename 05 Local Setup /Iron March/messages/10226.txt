<p>religion is a pretty major part of my worldview and its sorta meshed with fascism at this point, but those are all my own personal views. i cant really hate christianity because it's basically a white religion now and europe has made christianity great (I refute the common point that us whites were just barbarians before the glorious Jews showed us the true way, I can't take any nationalist who says that seriously) </p>
<p>And I really love christian aesthetic, cathedrals are one of the few man-made things that compares to nature in beauty. I'm also fond of rosaries. but all this aesthetic owes more to european culture than it does to Christianity. </p>
