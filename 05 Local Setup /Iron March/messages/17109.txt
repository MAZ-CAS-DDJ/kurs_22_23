	It's not paranoid if it really happened. Jews just created a big lie to push their agenda in modern days. It's not a victim complex, its a state of awareness to stay alive. Catholic church might not use soldiers against us this time, but they are still forked-tongued satanists and luckily majority of Serbs have recognized this and reject any element of Ecumenism that will make us accept their way. For us, The Papacy was always an enemy, it really doesn't matter if the pope is a militant crusader or a communist faggot. Their word is poison and their fruit (Croats) rotten. Hungarians will find themselves under huge pressure once you begin to stray from the multikulti path, no one is safe.<br /><br />
	I hope Croats don't care about us, it will be much easer waging a war against the enemy that doesn't invest in it's opponent. We are focused against Albanians, butÂ not for a second will we forget about the western parts of Serbdom that are under Croat yoke.
