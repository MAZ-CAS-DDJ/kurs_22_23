	Hell yeah. A Poolee is somebody in the DEP who is officially enlisted. We run PT and Drills and shit while we wait to get shipped out. Definitely something I'm looking forward too.

	Sucks that you're down South a bit. I'm in the Northeast. IronMarch is good to network with people in your area. I've met up with a lot of good dudes. Just be careful - Try to get a good idea of what people are like before you actually meet them. It could be a total letdown sometimes.

	There are a few Vets on IronMarch as well so if you lurk around you might find them. Make sure to start reading more of the content and guidelines and you'll fit right in. Don't ever compromise. Hooyah my friend.
