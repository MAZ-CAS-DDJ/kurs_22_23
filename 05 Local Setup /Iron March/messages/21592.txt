	I got my ticket today, still need to book the flights though. Do you already have any idea what's the planÂ for Friday? I have some friends flying there from Slovakia on Friday, the others from Czech Republic want to fly on Saturday. I'm thinking if it's worth booking an earlier flight to do some warm-up activities or at least some sightseeing.
