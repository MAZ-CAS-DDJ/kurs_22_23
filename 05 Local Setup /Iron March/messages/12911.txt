<p>I love how many whites are proudly cultureless and yet lust after all the nonwhite cultures. I feel that's almost an unconscious throwback to imperialism, thinking the world is yours to sample from and that you are above nature. Honestly can't stand listening to my parents and their friends trying so hard to be urbane and 'open-minded'. Ick. Thinking about it, it's likely the whites in your area would APOLOGISE for the chimpout.<br /><br />
Very interesting theory- frightening, but interesting. My dreams are generally surreal, neither good nor bad, but amusing and sometimes come in sequences. One time as a child I had a few nights where I kept dreaming I was inside different levels of a PC game. Have you had sequential dreams? Good to know you're not always being subjected to the creepy ones.<br /><br />
Absolutely. Not to sound like a Victorian romanticising the noble savage, but I've always found hope in the thought that, even if our civilisation falls apart completely and re-enters the Dark Ages, tribal living would be far healthier both for the psyche of man and for the earth. If you've really messed up, start from scratch! ... And if furries are overrunning schools, that might start to look like an appealing option soon.<br /><br />
Heh, then when the time comes for an SA reboot, you'll know who to call. How long is your hair? Gosh, that movie sounds 100% like the brainwashing everyone at my school is told German kids had to suffer back in the Third Reich. And that's excellent about your friends! The future really is the youth- less brainwashed and less ready to deal with BS.<br /><br />
Just "German"! Well that's always good. Well if you would share a picture, I wouldn't do it on IM, as you never know who's watching. Do you have retroshare or anything? Idk, I love this place, but I'm paranoid about sharing anything identifiable on it.<br /><br />
While I'm still fond of all that Frederick did for Prussia, I'm quite miffed by how much he preferred French culture over German. Yes, you're a product of the Enlightenment, but show some pride in the people you govern, Freddy! Also, he was a flaming homo (as far as many historians are concerned) and thus I find it quite funny how much the Nazis held him up as an ideal when he died childless and was so cold to his wife, who was a very sweet, nervous, pious woman and... ok, rant over. I just feel quite sorry for the poor thing, used as a pawn by a man who should have been kinder.<br /><br />
It's fine that you swear a bit- that's understandable when talking about things that make one emotional. Thank you for being so polite as to apologise, though. You're so nice, honestly.</p>
