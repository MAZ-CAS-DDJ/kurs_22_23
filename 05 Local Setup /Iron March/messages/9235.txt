<p>I understand. If you do find yourself able, I'd definitely be willing to do research as I have plenty of experience. And if you could get a hold of those guys, and push your idea, they might listen. They might find it pretty sick, or they might be busy with other projects. Regardless, it's better than just thinking about it. Thanks for responding by the way.</p>
