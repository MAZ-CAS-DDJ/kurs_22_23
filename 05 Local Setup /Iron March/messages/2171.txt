<p>Hello; I am sending this message to offer support of your claim that Catholics &amp; Orthodox Christians &amp; Muslims are allies against the jewish plague. There is no doubt that Christians &amp; Muslims, regardless of their different cultural interpretations of God, worship the same God - merely with a different cultural label &amp; perception. </p>
<p>Expect the jews to slander their way into &amp; out of any argument they end up in with you. There's a few of them on this website who like to pretend they're not jewish, also; you'll be able to spot them quickly.</p>
<p>I am a German immigrant, and am a traditional national socialist. </p>
<p>Sieg Heil,</p>
<p>&amp; Good Luck.</p>
