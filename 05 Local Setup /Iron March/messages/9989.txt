<p>I am getting over my past life too. We have a saying in Hungary: "you know a bird from it's feathers and a man from his friends". Also I need to streamline things a little. Minimalism is a key in the face of our world that wants us to care too much about nothing while consuming thins we don't need with money we don't own. I heard that the higher education is a base for creating cultural marxists. I think it has to do with the fact that the bullshit degree people can only work in education, activism and media. So they are basically reproducing the next generation of bullshitters who need to be even more crazy because they have a revolutionary idea. Feminism / social justice / cultural marxism will never reach it's end goal because the goal post is moving with the speed of thought. Because they are chasing mirages they made the gay issue the number one thing in the west but that wasn't enough they had to integrate transsexuals into that even if one is a gender and the other is a sexual identity. Also at first it was about acceptance now it's about bragging and giving the middle finger to society.</p>

<p>Yes. Europe is fucked. Especially the west and the north even more! Sweden is a running joke after all.</p>
<p>Thanks to the hippy pacifist education combined with cultural marxism pretty much made the people good consumers. I'm not a monk but people care more about the latest movie or game compared to things that are affecting them. Not to mention thanks to being indoctrinated they simply can't think about certain things. For example they always whine about violence, war etc. They bought into the pacifist bullshit and look down on old values as "not progressive". This means they simply don't want to get their hands dirty and be sensitive etc. So yes. I would love to see some Serb ultras beating up some ironic hipster faggots. "Where is your gender studies degree now, kebab enabler."</p>

<p>The European man has no allies now. The church is against them, the corporations and the system in general. Just look at the European Union. What a joke. The punch line is that slowly they are promoting the nationalist parties because their eternal "give more welfare etc" policy doesn't seem to work at all. But most people will adhere to the current power. They always do. I mean they already tolerate their liberties and rights being taken away among with their culture. Nobody dare to say a word.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In short: people are smart, masses are dumb.</p>
<p>So no need to get sad about it. But man I do hate sjw-s.</p>
