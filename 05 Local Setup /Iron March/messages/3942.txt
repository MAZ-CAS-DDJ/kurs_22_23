<p>Firstly, I wrote this as a crash course in National Socialism <a href="http://fascists.zxq.net/PDFs/An_Open_Letter_to_the_White_Man.pdf" rel="external nofollow">http://fascists.zxq.net/PDFs/An_Open_Letter_to_the_White_Man.pdf</a> specifically catering to Americans/internet people who are fairly new to politics. It should explain much. Significance depends on your goals and resources which are all measured and explained thoroughly, so you may want to skip to the second section 'Our Struggle.' if you have any questions feel free to present them</p>
<p>Internet 'activism' is only useful so far as it is a barometer for what you know and do in real life, you can use it as a resource, but sitting behind a computer will literally get you nowhere.</p>
<p>One thing I've noticed about you is even here on the internet you take things a little seriously. Lighten up, forming any sort of cell or party is a social exercise and does not require any purism or even much ideology.  Organization and dedication are necessary, but it is not a jackboot march, treat it like you are hanging out or something. Not everything needs an official brand stamp and just because you have some friends does not make it a 'party'- once you start seriously doing something, then you can assign ranks, create codes, and take that seriously, but until that point and even afterwards when you are trying to say, explain your position to a moderate, overt seriousness will harm you a lot more than help you.</p>
