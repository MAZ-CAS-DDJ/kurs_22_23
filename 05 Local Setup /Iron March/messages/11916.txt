<p>Na, I can fash with the worst of 'em.</p>
<p>I just try to keep things civil because I use this username on other sites, one being Politics Forum (POFO) for example, where I advocate and promote Fascism. I don't want to come right out and declare what I truly believe because people would no longer take me seriously.</p>
<p>It would be like, "Yes, I believe in total war. I believe in eugenics and the perpetuation of a master race. I believe in the absolute annihilation and worldwide liquidation of inferior human specimens. But we can still reason together, can't we?"</p>
<p>And that would be it for Fascism - at least as far it being successfully promoted by me. You never know who is scanning these threads.</p>
