	I am just going to be honest with you, aside from the trolls this is the only site where I can find reasonable people and information. If I remain in the shower I am just going to make another account and due to the inherent site value there is NOTHING you can do to stop me from participating in Ironmarch one way or another. I did everything for a reason and I prefer to stay with my plate rather then getting a new one. So removing me from the shower and letting me exist will be the best option. Since I have already proven my point I will cut back on the troll baiting.

	If I was originally placed in the showers for my faggotry then you would need to do the same to the many other users who act similarly to me.

	I am not here for entertainment, this movement is very important to me.
