<p>That is fine mate, I only just finished a bunch of work and have been knackered.</p>
<p>Ok, well here are my suggestions.</p>
<p>&gt;There is the job to write the article on Tommy Moran outlined in the resource - That said as I don't have anyone working on that you may want to propose a different historical essay</p>
<p>&gt;We really need people to adapt essays, I really like the articles written in blackshirt, they are a breath of fresh air - I still don't have anyone who will rewrite or caniblaise any of the articles.</p>
<p>&gt;If you have skype I can send you shedloads of documents from my archive. You can join us on ironmarch.</p>
<p>&gt;Look through what I have posted on the resource, something there like the blogs may inspire you.</p>
<p>If you do have any ideas I am more than willing to put in the time and the effort discussing it, I have been pretty good at providing people with interesting and relevant source material the more specific you get.</p>
<p>As the thing develops I may have some more things that are specific.</p>
