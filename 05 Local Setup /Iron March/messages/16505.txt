	My great great grandfather was a Confederate soldier that died in the Battle of Lookout Mountain, but everything that he fought for is dead. The modern South is full of capitalism, obesity and Jew worshiping, drug addled and alcoholic degenerate retards. Modern Southern pride is based on capitalist degeneracy , not on the aristocratic values of the Confederacy, even so I'm only half southern Â the rest of me is immigrants from Deutschland.
