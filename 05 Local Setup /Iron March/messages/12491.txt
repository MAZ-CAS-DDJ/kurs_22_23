I wasn't too fond of francis before but if he was involved with this that's a whole new level the article says she had diabetes though so I'm not sure could just be sensationalism<br /><br />Yeah, I like the sense of community as well. Trust me I would not worship alone if I could, I like the sense of belonging of community, I've been thinking about going to church again just to be able to socialize in a religious setting. I thinK pretty much all gods exist, even the Christian one( I know that seems contradicting but I can explain if you want), but that's irrelevant to me because I worship the germanic gods and focus on the spiritual teachings of ancient europe.The indo European religions though do seem like differing manifestations of the same basic values and concepts. Doesn't mean I tolerate all religions though, even if Allah exists he's a shit deity. Yeah, and I like being german too much. My nick name has already stuck. My grandpa has always been fascinated with genetics and german history so he's kinda preserved what little remains of our germanic heritage and passed it onto me. He used to speak Pennsylvania dutch all the time but not as much now. Most of my family comes from pennsylvania. It was flooded with germans in the 19th century and so has a lot of odd cultural traditions preserved from them, like hex signs which are these brightly painted wooden circles with swastikas and horse shoes, they're really beautiful and supposed to banish witches and demons and hung outside barn doors, I'm not sure if there's any german equivalent anymore. My profile pic is one actually, a more modern one though but it has the same design<br />And as for how I tend to pray, I have a shrine I've been slowly building since I started studying paganism. I have several rules I abide by based on studying the practices found in the sagas and histories on the germanic tribes. For example, I never approach my shrine unwashed or dirty, I treat my idols as if the gods have temporarily possessed them, and I always offer a portion of what I'm eating to them unless it's something unfit for gods, which unfortunately in america rules out almost everything<br />I usually give them offerings of water, incense, ale and burn hay, then sit at my shrine and pray and meditate on the myths and gods and their deeper meanings. I also think making things sacred to the gods is a form of prayer, so I've taught myself woodcarving</p>
