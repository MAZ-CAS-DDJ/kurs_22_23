<p>I can't really say anything against that. If you're getting disillusioned with fascism, then talk to Slavros and he should be able to tell you how to reconcile what you've learned with everything going on in the world. I mean, he knows and has read more than you, why is he still hanging around and producing stuff for the cause? What conclusion did he reach?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over all, I'd tell you that you shouldn't let esotericism just take you over. You should maybe slow down and discuss your findings with Slavros, Zeiger, or whatever. Make a thread or something.</p>

<p>You've also got to get your life on track before you just delve into this stuff, man. Esotericists don't make good money. I know it might seem small and stupid to you, but Slavros and Zeiger are both in their late 20s; they have the time to do all this stuff because they already have their homes and jobs in place. Think about it.</p>
