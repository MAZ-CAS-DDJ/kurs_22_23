<p>&gt;<span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;"> it's basically a white religion now and europe has made christianity great (I refute the common point that us whites were just barbarians before the glorious Jews showed us the true way, I can't take any nationalist who says that seriously) </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">exactly. it may not have its origins in europe (and thus will never <em>truly </em>be compatible with our worldview) but its been bent to our will, and we can use it to accomplish our goals, then so be it. and if we can't, we'll have a second Renaissance and ditch it for good this time.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">and YES, cathedrals are glorious. I see them not really as an expression of christianity but rather as an expression of the european creative spirit.</span></p>
