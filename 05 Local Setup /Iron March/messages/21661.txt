<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;">I was given a warning point for "quoting an image/video" in the "<span style="background-color:rgb(28,28,28);color:rgb(224,224,224);">Study Proves Blacks Are NOT People" thread, but I don't see where I have done so.  I would like to clarify in case it was a mistake or not.  </span></span>
