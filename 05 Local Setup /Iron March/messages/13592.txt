	We are still getting off the ground, so far we have about 20 guys. We have a flag and are working on getting a website. The American fascist situation is in the middle of a leadership crisis, and the OTHER main fascist group, Atomwaffen, has just been disavowed by Slavros. We are planning something big to get us in the news, namely a mexican flag burning at the next Trump rally. We have about 10 guys RSVP'd, we are just waiting for the venue to be announced. What we need now more than anything is a good graphic designer.
