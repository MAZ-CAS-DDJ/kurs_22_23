<p>The elysiumsgates link is a bit harsh on Athens but in a sense it is true that Athens and Corinth had more homosexuality, this is not denied by anybody; however to say that Athens was fag friendly or it was endorsed would be stretching the truth. I haven't done too much indepth study on Corinth to comment.</p>
