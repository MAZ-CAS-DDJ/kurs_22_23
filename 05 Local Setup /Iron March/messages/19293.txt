	No, he is absolutely for it, only he said there will be more Fascist Empires instead of one. Maybe that would ensure war which breeds the Fascist man.

	I felt the same and I understand what you say, yet I still believe that his position comes from an ideal; like in Islam where they reject the Avatar-like concept of Jesus for God in flesh would damage the absolute Divine Authority.

			Take this fact to its final limit, and you have one conclusion: masses of manimals on one side vs perfect Aryans on the other. And since all the civilizations and cultures are fake accidents anyway, we're bound to be left with this final scenario of manimals vs Aryans, which is the only true essence of what's been happening all along. (Basically, <u><em>the purpose of our existence is to try to accelerate the coming of the Apocalypse</em></u><em>—</em>that's the whole point of what I'm trying to say here.) And isn't that what you were always saying too, or am I misunderstanding you?

			I wanted to quickly reiterate how at the end God will manifest Himself fully with all of His qualities (i.e. the Last One who will be the perfect unity of the sharpest opposites, Sun and Lightning, etc, standard stuff), but I messed up the phrasing, and that's why the sentence seems to contradict itself.

	I see; so you meant this apocalyptic vision. God will enter in this world through His last Avatar in order to swallow it.
