<p>Your welcome. You assume right, I think a healthy household requires a man, who fits the definition of a man, to be the one who holds the authority. Though I don't see it as a submission to the man's power, it is more of a submission to stability. Basically, If a man is worthy, his authority over his family will be derived from God, so a woman is submitting to God when she submits to her husband. But I still feel that a man who has rightful authority will recognize that his wife's responsibilities are integral to the family and household, if he is fulfilling his role correctly, then he would only be domineering when necessary.</p>
<p>  The main reason I see things this way is because it has been almost entirely absent in my family, so I've seen the consequences in my personal experience as well as seeing the consequences for American society.</p>
