	Hey Bradon
</p>

<p>
	Canada must be a nice place to live! If I could live anywhere I would definitely choose Canada.
</p>

<p>
	The closest we have to Canada though, is Tasmania. It snows there too, but in the mid year haha I am hoping I can one day move to a small town in Tasmania. It is 95% European too. It is too hot in Australia.

<p>
	I only had a natural birth because I dont like the power structure in hospitals. You can watch "the business of being born" for more info, or get your spouse to. I value my fertility and didnt want any birth interventions possibly messing it up.
</p>

<p>
	I have two children, but I would like endless children. I am one of nine children myself. I believe strong large families is a huge strength and advantage.
</p>

<p>
	My first two children are actually from a previous relationship. Their dad was a Nordacist and started cheating, because I am not Nordic. Pretty silly, he should have only dated Nordics since that is his thing. But thats ok, I have two beautiful children now.

	My husband is American, he does not like the idea of having large families. I really want at least six. But he is happy having none and accepting my two as his own, I am not keen on that. I am 25 and not ready to give up motherhood. How many do you want? I think it is vital to have lots of children in the current Climate to ensure our survival.

	Sorry for the long reply!
