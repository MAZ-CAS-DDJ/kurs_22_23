<p>Heh, yeah it's not as if they're going to agree with you or you expect them to, lol. It's more information to radicalize those who feel it but don't know it for sure. This is what I love about Christianity, it radicalizes people, it gives them hard hitting truths. Red pilling christians about Jews (who they are and what they do) is the easiest thing because it's all in the bible to begin with.</p>

<p>and then you just point out their evil deeds they're doing today and their control of everything (MacDonald's culture of critique is a good recommendation) and it falls into place with them. All of my friends and family hate Jews now and most of them dislike niggers too, they already hated Pakis from the start though.</p>
