I've said before that if anybody could have been the next Hitler, Rockwell could. Rockwell sold the core attitude of national socialism to me before Mosley or Hitler did, in fact Rockwell does it in a better way in some ways. Reading Mein Kampf is swallowing a lot of truth, it'll be bitter for people who don't have an acquired taste, most people won't relate what's written in it to their own life or political situation until having been involved in the movements for a while. Most people don't even know that Hitler didn't value "racialists" who sit down in conference rooms very highly - this reminds me a lot of moderates and often useless outlets like AmRen and the John Birch Society.</p>
