<p>We have a few gypsies where I live. I suppose there being only a few is why they don't do anything stupid. I still watch out for any of them aproaching, you can never know when they would decide to steal shit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for the liberation - I seriously doubt that bulgarians were in a whole lot of danger of getting nuclear slap in the face for mistreating turkish in their hometurf. Whereas we have a very real chance.</p>

<p>Guess who are they going to target. I just hope I'll complete my bunker in time for the fireworks.</p>

<p>Also, I though about posting this in forums, but I wasn't sure whether it belongs to global or local news, or I should do it at all, as it's sort of old news - rooskies been 'deploying' their toys for almost a year now.</p>

<p>Three days apart. That's how long it took for them to realise that it was a bad move. Heh. Subhumans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, Iskanders are deployed in the whole Western District, so I would suggest you start digging your own bunker. Just in case.</p>

<p><strike>Seems fitting, gun control and all, but it's 200 fucking pages long and I can't read it all just to check.</strike></p>

<p>Check that, it's way too old.</p>
