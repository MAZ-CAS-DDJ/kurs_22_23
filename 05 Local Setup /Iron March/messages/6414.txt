Strangley enough, most ‘conservative’ thinking in this country and the US comes from British liberalism (which was based on philosophical empiricism, as opposed to continental-liberalism which was based on rationalism.) British liberalism was all about ‘checks and balances’, ‘the invisible hand’ in the economy and society (i.e. order arising out of exchanges based on individuals’ rational self-interest), and the empirically-minded belief that the best way to manage society was to let it evolve organically over time (the experience of generations…) So, as you can see, it lends itself to a sort of pseudo-traditionalism. But even if all that <em>was</em> originally a part of conservative or rightist thinking, it’s obvious what a rubbish strategy it makes nowadays – in the midst of a centuries-long drift to the left.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;">I agree we need ideas and a birds-eye view of political and social history. That’s what I’ve been doing on my blog </span></span></span><a href="http://integralaxis.wordpress.com/" rel="external nofollow">http://integralaxis.wordpress.com/</a><span style="color:#65584b;"><span style="font-family:georgia;"><span style="font-size:11.5pt;"> but I’ve barely got started. Plenty more, and <em>much better</em> analysis to come.</span></span></span></p>
