<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I'm slacking on my work a little bit, but this forum is on my mind now and I feel like I need to deal with it at the moment. I just saw this Hitler and the final solution thread here. Check out this post made by some Jew named Ahad Ha-Am  on this forum (last one on the thread so far):</p>
<p><a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/395-hitler-and-the-final-solution/page__st__60__p__10154#entry10154" rel="">http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/topic/395-hitler-and-the-final-solution/page__st__60__p__10154#entry10154</a></p>
<p>He bitches about persecution and gives off the typical "never again" cry with the "Holocaust." I do not believe the Holocaust happened, the numbers of Jews killed in reality is very small and probably even justified. Think of that article about organ trafficking I sent you. Jews deserve persecution, they have been doing nothing but robbing, murdering, and deceiving for centuries. This can and has been historically proven by scholars and researchers. I could recommend articles if you like.</p>
<p>This kike Ahad Ha-Am even has the audacity to use the following quote for his signature:</p>
<p><em>"When G-d made the Germans, He gave them three qualities: honesty, intelligence, and Nazism. But in His wisdom He decreed that they could only posses two at any time. Thus, if a German is honest and a Nazi, he cannot be intelligent; if he is intelligent and a Nazi, he cannot be honest; and if he is honest and intelligent, he cannot be a Nazi." -</em> Albert Einstein</p>
<p>Replace the word German with Jew and the word Nazi with murderer/trickster/thief and then the quote makes sense.</p>
<p>You know the Jews even claim that the Legionaries made pogroms against them which never actually happened. In truth, it is the Jews who have been persecuting my people along with the Germans for centuries.</p>
<p>Forgive me, but I will have nothing to do with a forum that allows Israel-worshipping and Jew trolls to run around degrading European heritage and history. I don't mean to be obsessive about all this, but I have dealt with Jewish hydras before and I don't want to deal with them again.</p>
