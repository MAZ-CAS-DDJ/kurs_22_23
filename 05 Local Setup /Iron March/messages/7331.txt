<p>I thought about getting involved in that thread, but by the time i was going to make a post, it was too late. At first i wanted to stay out of it though, and i messaged Vlad telling him i agreed with his ideas but didn't plan on posting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was pretty obvious that Slavros was hitting Vlad harder than he would've hit someone else who posted it. The whole "wheel of Vlad" and other things he kept doing made it apparent that it was not just that he disagreed, but that he wanted to put Vlad down personally, even though he said this wasn't the case.</p>

<p>I don't know much about 4chon, but i reviewed the content in that thread, and i didn't see anything IronMarch related. How was the forum embarrased?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And just out of curiosity, are you going to continue getting on IronMarch and posting despite your disliking of the adminship?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, sorry for bothering you and thank you for answering my questions. I just assumed you would know more about the situation since you defended Vlad last time he was banned and were involved in the Aryanism thread. Iv'e been gone all weekend and came back to find Vlad banned and was wondering what happened, and i would prefer to ask you than Ben or Slavros.</p>
