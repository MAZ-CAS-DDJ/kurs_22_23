<p>Outside of Mein Kampf and one article I haven't researched it an awful lot which is a big sin of mine to be honest. Volume 1 Chapter 7 and chapter 10 talk about the events of the war a lot and chapter 10 in particular talks more specifically about the stab in the back concerning the monarchy.</p>

<p>As far as I know it's largely true, but the blame itself cannot be taken away from the army by its maladministration of the food-supply throughout the entite war.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This seems to back up what I'd say to be true.</p>
