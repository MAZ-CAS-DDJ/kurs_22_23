<p>I was reading your post in "Your Ideological Journey" and you describe yourself as bouncing back and forth for a while between Hitlerism and Dutch National Socialism. Is Dutch National Socialism distinct from the way it was done in Germany? Will this come up in "Nederlandse Herstel Beweging"?</p>
