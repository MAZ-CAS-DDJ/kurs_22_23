<p>Actually I encourage you to go on leftist sites and argue with them if you feel that they are destroying the human race. Afterall, I always encourage free speech.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not aware if you realize this but....I am very opposed to capitalism. So it would be massively incorrect to label me as liberal. It is a vague word anyway with no real meaning. But if you bash liberalism, shouldn't you bash conservatism too? As I recall, fascists are far from conservative....</p>
<p>And I know many ears it falls on will be deaf. But in doing my study on you people, I'm not going to come in claiming to be just this neutral identity without spouting out my input. Besides, I've already been restricted to the opposition and concentration camp areas of the site, so I will not be bothering people unless they search for my posts.</p>
