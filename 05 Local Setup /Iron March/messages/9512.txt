<p>Hey Venator,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As usual I am excited to hear from you my friend. I always look forward to our discussions. Now to jump right in, unfortunately the whole write down your political ideology on a card at the beginning of the semester was an anonymous thing, though you were required to write your name on the card, the only person who got to see everyone's answers was the professor and only the professor. This really sucked in my opinion. As to the black M65 field jacket I think it shows off my Fascism because militarism is a part of our philosophy. I also ware a black cap as well. As for neofolk music I suggest that you listen to some songs by the group Von Thronstahl, especially their songs <em>Dressed in Black Uniforms</em> (I'll also confess that this is another reason I ware a black M65 field jacket) and their song <em>Age of Decay and Democracy</em>, which I think pretty much sums up how the world is today. Also I would suggest <em>We Walked in Line</em> (the cover version by the band Blood Axis, also a neofolk band).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now to begin the philosophical discussion. I think "might makes right" is morally justified because what right do the "weak" have on something claimed by the strong. I will admit that currently I am in the "weak" category, however I am slowly but surly getting into the stronger category, mentally I am strong and now I am working to make sure my body catches up. And now back to my point, my point is how is it ok that the weak come along and look at all the things the strong have accomplished through their (the strong) hard work and sacrifice, something the weak did not do. As stated before I do believe that the weak can become stronger through hard work and sacrifice, but if they simply skip this step and go to the strong and demand such things as equality, liberty,etc. then they have admitted their own weakness and are now trying to take from the strong. Now were is such theft morally justified? Now Venator, I must admit that I am currently unfamiliar with Nietzsche's "transvaluation of values concept" as I am still reading <em>The Will to Power</em>, which is the first book by him that I have read. Also, remember that my school does <strong>not have</strong> continental philosophy but analytical instead. To wrap this up Venator, my questions for you are where can I find an explanation of Nietzsche's "transvaluatin of values concept" or could you provide a brief explanation? Also, now that I have given you my thoughts on "might makes right" what are yours? Can you suggest a good first book to begin reading Julius Evola? These are my three questions to you. I am sorry for the incredible length of this message, but don't hesitate to write a long once back to me as well, as philosophical discussions should be longer in order to flush everything out. I look forward to hearing from you again my friend.</p>
