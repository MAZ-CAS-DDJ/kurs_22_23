<p>I owe you a thanks. My article was basically collecting what everyone had been saying on the issue but you made the best points. I have known that you always have a really good head on you, loved your posts since like 2012 or whenever 4chon was. Mark James, the former YBNP guy is head of the london branch and screens your posts, I remember someone writing you are in the area. I know you don't want to get involved yet, but if you ever feel like getting in touch with people you would be welcome. </p>
