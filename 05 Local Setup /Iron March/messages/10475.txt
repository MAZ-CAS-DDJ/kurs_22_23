<p>I'm going to be completely honest, aside from the Antimony, Fascist Alma Mater, all the material, etc.</p>
<p>The fact is that I've been working really hard going around my city and town and I've actually seen some progress. It's exhausting having to work with people who think 'resistance' is voting republican and telling their sisters they shouldn't marry niggers, and now they think they're some kind of heroes.</p>
<p>I don't know what it's like in Russia, but over here decadence is a fucking religion. Every day people find new ways to enter new depths of pacifism, faggotry, and general degeneracy.</p>
<p>You know what its like, how exhausting and tiring it is. That's probably the second biggest reason for wanting to be here, because the world doesn't make any sense especially the USA, and I can't find people like the ones here, especially the perspectives and the point of views on topics and world news, etc.</p>
<p>I don't care if it sounds or seems soft, but having a place like this to go to after a fucking month of working endlessly and tirelessly to get things going and being exposed to Modern bullshit is nice. I don't care if you or some others think I'm pathetic, I know who I am and I know what kind of life I've lived, I don't need anyone's confirmation or approval. </p>
<p>Whatever, if you're going to gas me go ahead and do it, it was just nice to be in a community of Fascists, especially having to live in a place like the USA, even the South where one would think traditional values would be held are being torn apart and more people adopting modernist liberal views. Not only that but the material here is great. So whatever, gas me or don't, either way I'm still going to be working towards Fascism even if it's just a small group here in a small town in the US. </p>
