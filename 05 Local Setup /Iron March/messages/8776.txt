<p>Edit: Oh yeah, and I'm fine I guess, normal, nothing interesting here. My ex is now a fairly popular videogame-live streamer... thing. So I can't stop seeing pictures of her or hearing her voice. There are pictures of her on my computer, every time i open my browser, FB, youtube, etc. So I'm just sitting around feeling regret and melancholy.</p>

<p>(I can share this stuff with you and it's not gay because you're a girl right?)</p>

<p>And another edit, happy Hitler's birthday.</p>
