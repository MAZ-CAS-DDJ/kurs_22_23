	By mobilizing the people. We are revolutionaries, yes? A revolution without the support of a significant amount of people is just a coup. I don't see how, in a country founded on democracy and in a country that has never been ruled by anything other than that, you expect a fascist government to suddenly rise while the "racial hierarchy forms from natural law." What does that even mean? You're talking theoretical bullshit, I'm talking real world application. Sorry I'm not devoting all of my energy into an unsolicited political debate.
