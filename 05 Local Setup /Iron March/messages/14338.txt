	Kinda forgot when exactly you left so will start with early may: Atomwaffen guys did another stickering which got the forum shoah'd after our host received complaints, but we re-established in just 3 days on a new host and had some dumb shits try to blackmail users whom they thought were AW members, but that didn't go anywhere, obviously. There was a momentary crisis with the Atomwaffen itself that is best not to go into, it's all fixed now however. One of the AW guys recently protested at a vigil for the fags that were shot up in Orlando, the police gave away his real name so its been all over the news.

	That's the most crucial parts I suppose.
