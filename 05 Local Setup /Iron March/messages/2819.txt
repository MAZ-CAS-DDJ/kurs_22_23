<p>You do realize that debating NSP is the same exact thing as debating FasCap, right? They are mirror images of each other. I admit, I've debated the two of them before but now I regret spending so much time on two arrogant assholes that already think that they have the whole world figured out. NSP is arguably better than FasCap, but still, he's little more than a racist communist (just as FasCap is nothing more than a monopoly man with a swastika).</p>
