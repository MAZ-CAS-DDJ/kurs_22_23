<p>You seem to understand this better than I do.</p>
<p>You are right, that avoiding religion would be no good path.</p>
<p>But then, I am of such a mind that going along with Christianity just for the sake of galvanizing people would feel like selbst-verrat. I suppose, that I would sooner see us fail than "prosper" under such a banner, maybe. Again, it is complex.</p>
<p>The only easy way for me to picture this is to imagine what would happen if they should succeed.</p>
<p>If a new fascist state were to be created.</p>
<p>Would it simply be a powerful state by itself?</p>
<p>Or would they end up turning it into some sort of bible-belt-turned-militaristic?</p>
<p>Sometimes, the cure is worse than the disease.</p>
