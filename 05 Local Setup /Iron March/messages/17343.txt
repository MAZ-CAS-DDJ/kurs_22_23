	The banner consists of the same colours. Red white and blue. on a horizontal placement  the stripes will face horizontally. Vertically on a vertical display of the banner. The middle of the banner will bear a blue circle, of which shall adore a white swastika. Now let me explain the deeper meaning the flag. The blue represents the unity of the people within the nation and their dignity within their nation. The red represents militarism and the will to fight for what is right and true, including the nation. The white represents the spiritual nature of the people, with a clean display of cultural religion and spirituality, as well as the identity of the European makeup of the new nation.
