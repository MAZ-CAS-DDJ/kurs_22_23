<p>We were founded in 1973 by Ben klassen a Florida state legislature who loved in 4 countries and inventor. We believe religion is the foundation of values in society and that we are in need of a revolution of values. To do this we offer the white race a new religion specifically structured to secure expand and advance the white race. Under matt hale who was our leader from 96 to 2003 we grew to 30,000 members. After his arrest things took a rocky decline but we are growing again over the past 2 years.</p>
