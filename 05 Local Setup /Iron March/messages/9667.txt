<p>Dear Mr. Jamison,</p>
<div> </div>
<div>Earlier in the year a member of our research group contacted you regarding the digitization of this collection. He was told that copies of the documents would not be permitted, and that digitization of these documents was not a priority for your institution.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Nevertheless, we are still interested in making a visit. We were also wondering if a form of copying that would not have the potential of harming the documents (i.e. photographs) would be permitted. Even if this is not possible, we would like to visit to determine if the documents are of significance to our research. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We thank you in advance for your reply.</div>
<div>
<br />Best regards, </div>
