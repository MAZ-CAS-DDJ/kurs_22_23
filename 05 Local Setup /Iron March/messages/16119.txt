	Well James Mason himself is a master of Fascistic Reckoning as the video attests, it's hard to really give directions on this as everything is just pure gold. I'd go thematic about it, like one clip dedicated to Charley Manson talk for example. Also in the first hour or less of the video Manson does the best facial expressions in the world that I used for those james mason memes - doing something at those moments to accentuate them or whatever would be great. Some fade-ins to footage of war or Timothy McVeigh or Charles Manson or Hitler or whatever is relevant, with epic music, and the effects, maybe make it feel like time slows down in those segments with some added minor echo on the original voice audio? Make it feel like a psychedelic trip with, seeing vishnu hitler or something like your black sun leopard.

	I'll post you Zeiger's input once he gets back, he might have better suggestions.
