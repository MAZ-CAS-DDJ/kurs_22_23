	I'm sure it does, but the individuals who have done the stickering have only begun. We have a surprise for Boston. It wont just be posters this time, that is petty and it doesn't accomplish much. We shall pull off the biggest midnight performance that this site has ever seen. The city is our puppet, we pull the strings and they dance. The symphony of the plot shall make them moveÂ for us.
