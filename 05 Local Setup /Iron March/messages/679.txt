<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>For me, nothing really new; i still do odd jobs, taking care of my little family, organize ceremonies, and the activist work.</p>

<p>He is only a minor official.</p>
<p>In time, he was in the ARB (Breton Revolutionary Army) and was responsible for relations with the IRA and ETA, and welsh autonomist.</p>

<p>Studying a language without alphabet but with sinograms teach us a lot of things, a different kind of mentality and communication.</p>

<p>large enough</p>
<p>There is no intercomprehension possible. Perhaps as far as germanic and slavic languages.</p>

Otherwise, I have no problem with the nuclear family.  It should remain a sub-unit of the larger family or clan, but otherwise I don't have a problem with the nuclear family.  Could you explain your thoughts on this matter?</div></blockquote>
<p>In time, as the era of my father, the family lived together under one roof: uncles and nephews, aunts and nieces, cousins​​, grandparents and grand son.</p>
<p>They lived for eight pieces. It was an organic community, and everybody knew themselves in the city because of the relationships of kinship.</p>
<p>Now, an isolated family is no longer anything at all, sociologically it does not mean anything,  and divorce does not astonish me.</p>
<p>How can we live in being alone, without any external help?</p>
<p>It may be difficult to design for an Anglo-Saxon, but in the Latin countries, solidarity between people does not exist.</p>
<p>I think we should go back to concepts more organic, more rooted, like the man always lived.</p>
<p>And not favor the concept of modern, atomized nuclear family which is the basis for commercial and consumerist system.</p>
<p>For housing or work, for example, each generation must start over at 0 now.</p>

<p>revolutionary ideologies are unavoidable.</p>
<p>We all must study marxist-leninist-maoists theories for the practice and the analysis.</p>
<p>I do not like their ideology, but their practice is the most successful.</p>

<p>tests only selected those who have the ability to answer tests, that's all, nothing more.</p>
<p>in history there are leaders who were enormously way to school.</p>
<p>What should be the criteria for these tests? knowledge =  belonging to a social class, or intelligence = criterion which measures nothing?</p>

I have no love for pride parades, but otherwise I see nothing worng with it.</div></blockquote>
<p>I don't speak about the homosexual sexuality, but about the culture and the network, homosexuality is a lobby, perhaps the most powerfull after the jewish lobby.</p>
<p>Almost half people in media, politic and especially culture are homosexuals. Homosexuality promotes an ultra bourgeois society.</p>
<p>Himmler or marxist-leninists  correctly identified the problem.</p>
<p>- At work or in politics, gay help each other to the detriment of heteros.</p>
<p>- Economically, two salaries per couple and no family, they are big consumerist, and thus influence the economy.</p>
<p> - They are cowards and perverts.</p>

<p>A return to roots is inconceivable outside a socialist system.</p>
<p>- Because of the material concerns predominant among individuals, and also wealth or security.</p>
<p>- Because of  lobbyies, homosexuals, Jews, anti-racist, feminist, pacifist, drugged, Freemasons and all these things.</p>
<p>- Because of the open borders and immigration, inevitable consequence of a free market.</p>

<p>An alternative to acculturation, multiculturalism or chauvinism (only the national culture).</p>
<p>This means that we consider that cultures are equal, as we study them, but that 1 ° we do not mix them 2 ° we focus first in our culture and knowledge dissemination 3° there is no subculture like mcdo, iphone and hip-hop.</p>
<p>Ethnic homogeneity is suitable so it does not drift into multiculturalism.</p>

The true tragedy of modern paganism is that it is separated from the family due to the fact that it is no longer the dominant societal belief system.<p>It would be great to see society return to the old religion.  I am not a particularly spiritual person, but I would gladly join a community that advocates the veneration of ancestors.  We owe them everything in the literal sense of the word</p>
<p></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Except in the USSR period, paganism has continued in the Baltic countries, there is still almost a third of pagans.</p>
<p>After it's like Christians, it is not because they say they are more pagans that they do pagan rituals and know all the mythology, but it is interesting to know this fact. And I do not even speak to you of Lapland, there is always shamanism.</p>
