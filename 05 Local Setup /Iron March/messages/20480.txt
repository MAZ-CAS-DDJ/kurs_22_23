	It's not drying from the rain. Every now and then it rains and it get wet again, and it's too long to keep anywhere else. So we got a tarp to cover it but water is still seeping in, and it's taking longer to dry besides due to not getting sunlight. Ah well, we'll figure it out. Might just splurge out for a bought banner, but we're planning on doing banner drops and might have to leave it behind if something goes wrong, which would be a few hundred AUD wasted.

	Wew, a hundred nationalists is jail for a few years? Here our police are too incompetent for that, they spent about 6 months to a year after one violent rally rounding up wrongdoers. But then that was just an 'anti racist' march opposed by 'patriots'. I know no idea how they'd deal with us, there hasn't been a real nationalist presence in Australia for decades. The Swastika isn't technically illegal in Australia, though many people think it is and you can potentially get dragged through the courts for 'offending' someone, but that'll happen no matter what symbols we use or words we say, as long as we're not cucks. Even moderate right wingers get done under 'hate speech' here, just like in blighty.
