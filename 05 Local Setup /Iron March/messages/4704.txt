<p>Yeah. Mostly been getting high. Can't complain, it's fun. Not too much to do here unless you want to assburger all summer on the computer, though.</p>
<p>Funny you know, years go by, and every time we exchange the news it's the same "Bored, nothing to do".</p>
<p>What else? Ironmarch gathered a several hundred euros donation to build a website, the designers hired tried to run away with the cash and Alex hired a private investigator.</p>
<p>Torren got arrested a billion times, almost died in a firefight with the cops, anarchists tried to get him by telling their agent inside of the military base Torren lives in to arrest him, but Torren backtraced them and the anarchist leader will get tried to espionage and will be buttraped because this all happened in North American Aerospace Defense Command.</p>
<p>I also stopped seeing that one girl after one very adventurous night during which my friend got arrested and charged, we blacked out and I woke up in a room with furniture throw all around, and the bed I was lying on was covered in blood and in addition to that all my pockets were covered in tobacco.</p>
<p>I also nuked my computer when I thought cops were on my ass.</p>
<p>Those are from the top of my head. Yeah. And it can still get boring. Heheheheh. Well, I'm gonna go out now, but I'll be back.</p>
