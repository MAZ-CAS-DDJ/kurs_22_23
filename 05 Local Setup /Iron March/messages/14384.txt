	Hey! Thought like sending a message so we don't clutter up the intro thread. Sorry if I seem so eager to talk, it's just very cool and rare to meet another musician who's into Fascism, as most people in the art world seem to be full-blown liberals/SJWs, as I'm sure you know. I'm actually in the process of writing an article for IronMarch's webzine, NOOSE, about classical music and my own theories on why modern artists seem to be so left-leaning.

	By the way, if you don't have a skype account already, you should get one, as a lot of us here on IronMarch have our own little skype community as well.
