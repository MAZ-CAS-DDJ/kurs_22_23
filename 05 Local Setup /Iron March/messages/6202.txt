<p>Absolutely, only unity can save us. Most of the bad blood from our region had at least one Great Power involved</p>
<p> </p>
<div>A few examples:</div>
<div>- Austro-Hungary fooled Bulgaria into starting the last Balkan War</div>
<div>- Fascist Italy &amp; the Third Reich destroyed Yugoslavia and made their personal pawns out of the Serbs and Croats</div>
<div>- Fascist Italy forged the Principality of Pindus(which was, to a certain extent, an Aromanian State) in order to weaken Greece and spread even more hate between Romania, Greece and Bulgaria.</div>
<div>And the list can go on and on and on...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I find it stupid for the most part, as we are all to a certain extent related and these wars could be considered fratricides.</div>
