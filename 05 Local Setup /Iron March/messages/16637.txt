	Recent arrival by the name of Aussie Dude is definitely not suited for this forum.  I encountered him on facebook 6 months ago and know beyond a doubt that he is severely autistic (as in the medical sense of the term).  The link below should provide necessary evidence when compared to his bio.  His full name is Keelan Law.   The member Unity and i can both vouch for his unsuitability.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/tasweeked-a-different-way-of-being/news-story/7efef38e24caf7fcc799fe0265ba9a86" rel="external nofollow">http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/tasweeked-a-different-way-of-being/news-story/7efef38e24caf7fcc799fe0265ba9a86</a><br /><br />
