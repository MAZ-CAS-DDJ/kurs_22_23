<p>Hi NorthumbiranWisa,</p>
<p>Many of my ancestors came from near to you. A wonderful region of the UK and England. Now...</p>
<p>How long have you been here, on Iron March Forums? Why are they so aggressive to nationalists who should be their friend?</p>
<p>Is there any wonder, that nationalism is in trouble?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
