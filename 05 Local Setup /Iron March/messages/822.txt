<p>The share teh main ones (christmas, easter, etc) and I think they share fasts. They may differ on the celebration of Saints and the Orthodox Church goes by a different calender so their Christmas is in January as they use the Gregorian calender.  Other differences between teh two churches are the Orthodox church does not have a "Pope" although the Archbishop of Constantinople has some special reverance as he is the Archbishop of the Capital of Christian Rome. The churches do not answer to a single person they merely recognize eachother as Orthodox that being said they are more open to nationalism and do believe in preserving cultures as being unique and created for a purpose. Obviousely you will find that because of this liturgies in America will have parts spoken in the tounge of it's origin, i.e. Romanian church will have part of the litrugy in Romanian (only about 5%) same goes for Russian, Coptic, etc unless the Parish in question is strictly OCA or the entire parish no longer speaks the native tounge (like if all the immigrants have left or something.)</p>
