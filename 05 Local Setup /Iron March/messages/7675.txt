<p>Yeah, I've seen a bit of that before- it's on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/GeorgeLincolnRockwellNationalSocialistPioneer" rel="external nofollow">Internet Archive</a> which means it's probably public domain by now.</p>

<p>Yeah, you've got a point. There's so much untapped potential in this country. I think Jack van Tongeren (an Aussie NS revolutionary) said in his book that 'national socialism' has always existed in Australia- the country was basically founded on a mixture of racialism and community-spirit style socialism. The biggest pushers of the White Australia policy were the unions and Labor Party. It's persisted to the extent that even in my office people openly make disparaging comments about abos or Gypsies, or talk about "the Iberian termperament", and nobody bats an eye. They use much rougher language in private. It's just that younger people's views are changing, and nationalists here are as disorganised and squabbling as they are in the UK. Cronulla's kind of an example- it happened, caused a fuss in the media, but noone could really capitalise on it (they tried). It's a pity.</p>

<p>Here's a <a href="http://home.alphalink.com.au/~radnat/otherradicalism/05.html" rel="external nofollow">couple</a> of <a href="http://home.alphalink.com.au/~radnat/conspiracy.html" rel="external nofollow">articles</a> on Aussie NA. These were written by Jim Saleam, who started and ran it, so they have a bias to them &amp; are a bit self-serving/justifying. He's an interesting guy. Very polarising figure for nationalists here- he's totally committed, been an activist for over 40 years, probably the 'authority' on the history of Australian nationalism. But he disavows himself of NS (now, anyway, though he's still anti-Zionist) is kind of a shitty organiser and has attracted a lot of hate for various reasons. Also got another article on NA but it's a pdf from an academic journal, not public domain so I'd need to email it or something. It's briefer and a bit of an easier read from my pov, Saleam might be hard to follow if you're not overly familiar with him or Aussie history in general. Cheers.</p>
