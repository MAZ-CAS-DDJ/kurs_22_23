He went AWOL, but he wasn't a deserter. Many ecumenicalists also have an unhealthy interest in the occult, but you may be right in that being a case of one person engaging in two evils.</div></blockquote>
<p>"The Lord became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. <sup>10 </sup>Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the Lord’s command. <sup>11 </sup>So the Lord said to Solomon, “Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates."</p>
<p>Solomon was a disgusting pagan - I am sure he will recieve only Gehenna upon the time of resurrection.</p>

Lots of others want to see all the churches unified under one central organization. There ain't that much difference now that we're all about equally depraved, and it might help prevent extremism.</div></blockquote>
<p>Extremism? Extremism is exactly what we need - the christianity we have right now is simply nothing like what is described in the scriptures. There is no reason to simply roll over and settle for less than total purity of faith.</p>

They were correct in saying that the men in Rome were not the personal messengers of Heaven, but they fail in saying that men in London or Geneva (or, heck, Loma Linda) were.</div></blockquote>
<p>A few did - Michael Servetus, for example. He was burnt at the stake by protestants for rejecting the trinity.</p>
<p>The reformation was more or less a failure - yes we lost the total domination of the pope - but the popery remained. Many who did see the truth suffered the same fate as Servetus</p>
<p>“In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.” 2 Timothy 3:12</p>

When it came to other denominations, I would often point out to my Baptist pastors that different does not necessarily mean wrong, and wrong does not necessarily mean Damned Wrong (Baptist pastors don't seem to like me much).</div></blockquote>
<p>Of course - there will be some differences, but many of today's differences are simply an offence to the religion. Many 'traditions' pracitced by 'christians' today are simply devil worship.</p>
<p>We will have to accept the fact that minor differences will arise, but we do not have to accept the awful displays put on by christendom today.</p>
