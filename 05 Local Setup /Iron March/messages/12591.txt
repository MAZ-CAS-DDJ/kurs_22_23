<p>Sounds good; don't really know of a place like that though. The one I'm thinking of is quite good for clandestine meetings, but there's no avenue of escape if you're thinking along those lines.</p>
<p>If it were just us I wouldn't worry about antifa or anything, plus the vast majority of Melbourne antifa is very all bark little bite. I suppose I could be antifa since I don't have a posting history here, I do on another website though which goes back a year and a half. I'm fairly confident you're not either.</p>
<p>Was there anyone else up for a meetup or just us so far? How busy are you?</p>
