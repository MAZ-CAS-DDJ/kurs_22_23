<p>Whilst it's absolutely vital to establish a network of full-time and dedicated activists, it seems to me that those at 'National Action' have little interest in anything that isn't a primitive Neo-Nazism. It would be tragic for genuine, and intelligent, nationalists to throw away their names and characters by ranting and raving about an international Jewish conspiracy. The half-baked ramblings concerning usury also simply appear to be a product of misinterpreting the likes of Ezra Pound. Talk of 'Social Nationalism' makes me cringe as well, if one isn't bothered about being labelled as a racist, why not simply be frank and employ the label 'National Socialist' . . . The chauvinistic and petty desire to prove one's 'credentials' in the nationalist scene is derived through ego, and not a considered approach as to what would best serve the cause. Besides, race is a materialism upon which culture is built; it isn't the end of the question by any means.</p>

<p>I appreciate your desire to shape up anyone or anything you can, but I've little faith in these schemes; they reek of youthful naivety. Constant references to the 'Reds' also suggests to me that those at 'National Action' are simply trying to relive a spent and long since buried narrative. We're not dealing with 'Reds' who, in many respects, deserve an infinite amount of respect in comparison to the confused progressives who now espouse their own rehashed and ill-conceived dogmas, Frankenstein by nature. Either we surrender irrelevant narratives, impossible attempts at situationalism and false dichotomies, or we perish.</p>

<p>There lies an ideological framework beyond the likes of the swastika and the hammer and sickle. This is a new age, and those who wish to relive the lives of Hitler, Mussolini, Mosley or any other 20th century personality demonstrate self-interest and not national interest.</p>
<p>But alas, all the little Hitlers will have their way for the time being, imagining themselves to be great and mighty radicals ready to overthrow Parliament. England has been a factory for them, they're everywhere!  </p>
