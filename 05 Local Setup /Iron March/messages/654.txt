<p>Well, when I look at his username I see "<span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Владимир_Борисов</span></span>". Being of an English persuasion I can't read or write that, I'm not going to copy and paste it every time I mention his name either. So I look at his first name and I see 'B' an 'a' and a few 'n's so my mind immediately fills in 'banana'. Nothing more than that.</p>
<p>The surname is an almost direct "bop 'n' cob" for me.</p>
