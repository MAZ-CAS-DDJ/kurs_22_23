	The feud between us and Hungarians is old. It goes back and forth, both sides being asses, but also both sides showing common sense and nobility at times.

	This is a very long lesson in history, the root of it all being the claim for Transylvania which had always had a majority romanian population. It also does't help that both populations have strong nationalistic tendencies.

	Basically is something similar to the feuds between french and germans, or danes and swedes, or portuguese and spaniards etc you get the point. It also depends on the person. I for example, don't have anything against hungarians, i wish them no malice or harm, but i do love to banter and argue with them in a friendly manner.

	At the end of the day, if history is any indicator, we will put aside the rivalry for a common cause. Eastern Europe has a long history where the nations fought each other but when against an outsiders(i.e Ottoman Empire) we always banded together.

	Hope it answers you question because i would need a lot of space to lay out the entire history of this part of Europe and why romanians are right :D
