	Hey, Florian. I'm having trouble understanding the fascist stance on the Jewish Question when it pertains to the apostles who never denounce their blood which belongs to the Hebrew people.

	It almost seems conflicting at times when a stance is taken like this and then we look to people like Paul and Peter who were clearly Jews biologically though they renounced the title of "God's chosen people" and found a brotherhood in Christ. Obviously we wouldn't want Hebrew people in our nation as it goes against our racial characteristics but how do we go about defending these people without cucking?

	Is there any resources that you would suggest or perhaps do you yourself have the ability to clarify all this? Thanks.
