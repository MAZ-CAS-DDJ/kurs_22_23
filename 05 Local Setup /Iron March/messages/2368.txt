<p>The Anglo variants of the New Right are different from their continental European counterparts. Unfortunately, the Anglo New Right is and always has been infested with numerous freaks and cranks and derelicts, including the Esoteric Hitlerist nuts you mention, so it'd be better to just begin anew rather than attempt to breath some life into it. People like Troy Southgate are seen as clowns even within far right circles.</p>
<p>CasaPound is pretty much the continental Nouvelle Droite program translated into more a practical "street" level, so the people who claim that their ideas are mere intellectual masturbation simply have no clue what they're talking about.</p>
<p>I haven't read that entire Michael O'Meara book, but from the parts I have read, he doesn't do justice to the Nouvelle Droite's thought and he inserts lots of his own theories on "da Jooz" and White Nationalism which have little to do with the Nouvelle Droite. Luckily, I can just read the original stuff in French and don't need to rely on the tendentious interpretations of others.</p>
<p>It really wouldn't be that hard to build an American movement based on the CasaPound model: find capable leadership, emphasize culture, blur the left/right distinction, marginalize or expel freaks and crackpots, appeal to students and the young, form social networks, cut a good public image, be idealistic, etc. In other words, learn how to sell your product to your audience. This isn't rocket science, but many people on the right are such rejects that even simple concepts need to be explained to them. </p>
<p>Anyway, you should post at Salo.</p>
