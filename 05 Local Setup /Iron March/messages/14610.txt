	Ive always been interested in radio operations too, though I don't know if I'd like it as much because what I had actually wanted to do was sit in a tank and dick with the radio all day. But nowadays they have no need for a radio op. So, emergency medicine it is. I just don't want to end up sitting in a desk and poking sick kids with popsicle sticks all day.
