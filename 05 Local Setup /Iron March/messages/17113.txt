			Romanians really killed a lot of our people in the wars of the past. They are trying to assimilate the Szeklers even today. Same with Slovaks, same with Serbs. That's however still not an argument for their extermination. Don't misunderstand me, I would be happy if the motherfuckers in our government would have had balls back in the '90s and would have gone to war for Transcarpathia, Bácska and the Slovakian territories of the Second Vienna Award, but what's the point if every government in the region is ruled by Jews including ours? As long as we don't change that every form Irredentism is just for show. The Hungarians living in Bácska would have the exact same shitty life within Hungary minus the assimilation, but who cares about that if we are unable to deal with the demographic crisis even within our own country? They are assimilating anyway into Globalism via Americanization.

	Eh, I oppose assimilation of such unique European identities into another. I really don't know how Hungarians are being assimilated here as they have every right they can possible have including dual citizenship with their mother country.  The only problem here that occurred was that some of their priests weren't Hungarians but Croats and they got mad about that, still that is internal problem, nothing we can do about it. <br />
	They might have shitty lives but they would feel secure because they are with their own kind in the same shit. Luckily no one is threating or harassing Hungarian community here. Heck, more people are sympathetic toward them because of our shared view on immigrants (opposed to our government).<br />

			I was always amused by this. How do you not see that the Church is infiltrated and the pope does the opposite of the Catholic teaching? The Orthodox Churches are still full of former Communist agents, does that mean that Orthodoxy is Communism? Of course not. Hungary was attacked by Orthodox states through history but even the most hardcore Chauvinists of ours wouldn't state that there is an Orthodox Crusade going on against us behind the curtains, for that's just laughable. Seeing today's West as Catholicism is like seeing the Soviet Union as Orthodoxy. The Catholic Church is of course infected with decadency, but as I mentioned that's the same with the Orthodox Church, and these facts has nothing to do with true Catholicism and Orthodoxy. That's simply their corruption, not their nature.

	We have been in opposition to the Catholic Church from the beginning. The moment they split and began reforming we have found ourselves in opposition to them. Luckily now, most of our brothers and sisters in Europe see the fallacy of Papacy and are going in the right direction. Vatican was doomed to fall because of not staying true to the faith. Also, what Orthodox country did attack Hungary?  Romanians invaded when that idiot tried to turn Hungary into a communist state, once crushing the revolution they pulled back. Other than that I really don't know of a Orthodox nation that invaded you, I know we didn't :D<br /><br />

			"Luckily" that means that they will weaken Christianity further. Not if that it wouldn't be in a shitty state already.

	Chirstianity for us is only with the Orthodoxy, others are heresies. Rejecting and weakening  the will of the Vatican can only straighten Christianity. Ofc, i'm speaking about us, in the East, West is dead and I don't see anything or anyone that can help them. I hardly believe faithful of V4 give a shit about Pope or Vatican today and are in dire need of national churches like we have them.

	They lost nothing in the war, we did. Revanchism is what we want.
