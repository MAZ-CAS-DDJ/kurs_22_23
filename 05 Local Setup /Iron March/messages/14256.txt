	Currently I just dabble, making things out of old files, lawnmower blades and the like. At the present moment all I really do is rough out blanks with a bench grinder and files and make bends with a torch and bench vise. I recently acquired a gas forge, and some basic tools, but I'm still on the hunt for an anvil. It's a really interesting topic, and it's much more rewarding to use you own ingenuity to make a tool than just go out and buy one. Taking something like an old, rusty piece of rebar and turning it into a valuable tool is something that I really enjoy.
