<p>I looked for local library David Irving books and found, in this Republican/Jewish ghetto area of southern NJ, but 1 covering Hitler's Germany from 1933-1939.  I will endeavor to get the other 2 from my main local library on Hitler and Churchill - they have a decent arrangement with Princeton Uni for borrowing. I even managed a few years ago to get an obscure book on Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe this way - forgive me, I know, but I find him an interesting nigger.  Back to Irving...although he is vilified in the mass trite called media, he was the one that exposed the "Hitler Diairies" as nothing but forgery and, what thanks does he get?  Zero;</p>

<p>What you found was a preface for Hitler's War that Irving made several years later. I definitely also reccomend that. Btw, that is what I mean by 'unabridged version' as in, including the pre-war years.</p>

<p>- in the turmoil of the day, I did happen to notice, but did not read it, that there is new assessment of Chamberlain that paints him, in the Brit perspective, in a more positive light.  I agree with you that he was a weak negotiator and, had he been stronger, then lives would have been very different for us all. Although I am a Brit. and a nationalist for that country, I wish that Chamberlain - or Mosley had the drunk enabled him to - negotiated peace with the Reich.  Failing that, had Hitler had the balls to invade the island and succeeded - as imo he would have through over-whelming might once across the Channel, I think that the nation would have accepted fascism and become decent adherents;</p>
<p>- The Goyles thread link - I assume that is Ben - regarding warmongering WSC from Nov 2011 was great and I doubt I would have found it without your help: thank you. I find it re-assuring that another Brit in Goyles has a loathing for that national kike loving drunken slob. In fact I attempted to send Goyles a PM just to thank him but, it appears, one cannot PM Admin - shit, but understand;</p>

<p>The prolonged war was total and utter extortion. <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/340-regulation-18b-and-the-second-world-war/?p=4196" rel="">This post</a> elaborates further.</p>
<p>and yes Goyles is Benjamin Noyles of the <a href="http://integralistparty.zzl.org/" rel="external nofollow">Integralist Party</a> and <a href="http://national-action.info/" rel="external nofollow">National Action</a></p>

<p>- on the kike matter, I heartily agree with your summary although, I think, that the Semitics brought about a world government earlier than the 1990's....more like by a decade earlier with then rapid erosion of global capital movement.  As for the 1920's, Germany got properly FUCKED in the 1919 Versailles Treaty....with Wilson, Lloyd-George (with WSC in tow) and Clemenceau all having Jewish advisers at their sides, as well as serving their own national interests. I feel that the kikes advising prevented the already growing idea of shunting their kith into a homeland in Palestine: now, had that happened in the 1920's, well, we can but speculate;</p>

<p>Well there were several clear attempts at it that have been thoroughly documented, and they all had degrees of success that seem to be proportional to their proximity to our times. Doesn't really matter their scope of control in the world though, it is a fact that industrialists naturally conspire to set prices whenever they meet then it is also a fact that in whatever nation the Jews congregate they seek to create a central bank under their own control. They've had a great amount of influence in say your country for the greater part of its imperial history. That influence has hardly ever suffered any losses since Cromwell's time.</p>

<p>I still, however, feel that, while not recognized at the time, the concentration camps were and continue to be the millstone around the neck of National Socialism;</p>
