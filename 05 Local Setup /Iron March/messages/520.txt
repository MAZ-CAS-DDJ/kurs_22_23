<p>I don't consider NCO's officers. Likewise, the trial<em> should </em>be hard, bearing in mind how much of an influential and critical position the officer class holds. They should never forget the sort of price they paid for the position, since the goal isn't to pursuade everyone to try and apply, rather, it's the opposite.</p>

For example, soldiers get a plurality in the citizenship and then vote for lowering the military requirements.</div></blockquote>
<p>Why would they do that when they already have the vote? I have considered this as a possibility though, which is why the administration for military affairs (this is the civilian government, not the head generals and officer class) is made up of appointees from the various industries, and make decisions on military affairs in the name of the state, not the officer class. Only their executive is directly elected by the voters: they are first selected as representatives of their industries in parliament and then selected by parliament to run the military administration jointly with the officer class. Therefore it could be one of the representatives from fishing, another from tractor manufacturing, another from fertilizer production etc.</p>

I would say the biggest problem in America isn't that bankers are senators and his son is a colonel (although that happens and it is fucking enraging), but that Rockefeller, Kennedy, and Powell are in the same country club or all own an island in the same archipelago. Your system seriously cuts back on this by making citizenship a non-inheritable trait, but how is Kennedy going to evaluate Rockefeller's son when he knows Rockefeller from the Syndicate Council meetings and Executive elections.</div></blockquote>
<p>Every system gives leeway to corruption, its just one of those things thats impossible to control. Bear in mind however that all of these people will now have a much harder time because of the purely meritocratic structure and all the checks and balances now in place. So in this case, the banker knows a senator or whatever, but they now both have responsibilities to 1 Voters 2 Superiors 3 Each other, that if aren't met, will end in their replacement. Its much harder to sign some sort of deal that way. Plus I never mentioned the secret police... probably because I'm not sure who to give that responsibility. Obviously, the system has flaws, probably because it isn't fully developed yet, and while I've put a lot of thought into it, what it'll never be is complete. Problems and flaws are inevitable, and obviously, based on this as well as how history simply flows, there will be natural kinks in it that will need repair, once (if ever) implemented. This is natural, and the inevitability of every political system. Just as an example, the US has had one fixed government for its whole history- how much has that government changed over the years, to adapt to social change?</p>

<p>It's fine, and good, since I'm a great lover of debate and argumentation. One thing I hate is when people, especially from the west, even more especially from the Anglic countries start <em>apologizing </em>for their beliefs. Not that I'm saying this for you, you haven't done it, but it normally comes in the form of "I don't mean to be offensive" "okay, I'm sorry if this offends you but" "I know how this is gonna sound" and worst of all "I'm not trying to be <em>ignorant"</em></p>
