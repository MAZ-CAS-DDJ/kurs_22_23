<p>How long ago was yours? The feels, me too. </p>
<p>East Europe is the dream, you're no retard for thinking so. Zagreb would be awesome, maybe out on a farm in Zagorje/Podravina, I still have family there.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure, that's the worst part. I don't know. He started getting angry all the time, stopped going out of his house, got drunk every night. Every day when I went to take care of him he would be either enraged or very sad. He has some problems with depression, you might see. So that went on for about three months. Everybody was telling me to leave him. Even he told me to leave, he said I had to be careful around him to stay safe. I didn't, so he packed his shit and went back to his family's home in Texas. That was about a month ago.</p>
<p>Why yours?</p>
