<p>Yes, sadly I don't feel that the AFP has any real future both in and outside of the democratic system. It has allowed its reputation to be slandered beyond the point of repair and the way in which it is run strikes me as disorganised and amateurish. I was involved with the Australian Protectionist Party for a while, but later learned just how pro-Zion the higher-ups were. I met some good people through the connections I made in the APP, but I no longer publicly support the party. They would, of course, be better than nothing, but are far, <em>far</em> from perfect. As far as I am concerned, Australia does not yet have a third-position political party in the political loop, which is a grave disappointment.</p>
