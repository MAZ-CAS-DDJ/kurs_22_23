<p>Along with Benjamin Noyles, Mierce and vlad, you are one of the more intelligent posters here. The rest I've seen so far are intellectualists or childish keyboard commandos.</p>
<p>Even though I take some issues with capitalism here and there and prefer the true traditional Sumerian form of distributism, I can't stand to see the marxist critiques and these victim culture arguments that prevail whenever there is an argument about 'exploitation' and unions. Capitalists are right when they refute the exploitation theory and refute the bullshit of the class conflict stirring unions.</p>
<p>It's great seeing you rip that guy NSP (?) apart. Typical intellectualist retard.</p>
<p>Keep it up.</p>
