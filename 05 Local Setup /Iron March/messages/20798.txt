	Hello!
</p>

<p>
	If you have any questions about English language, just send me a message. I have lots of time and I like talking to people. If you're writing something and you're too lazy to "proof-read" it yourself, I will look. I can explain things by showing examples. I'm mainly interested in Russia, Bulgaria, Georgia and Ukraine, but Poland is cool too, I guess <img alt=":rockwell:" data-emoticon="" src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/default_rockwell.png" title=":rockwell:" /></p>

	I'm studying programming this year and I like Linux.
