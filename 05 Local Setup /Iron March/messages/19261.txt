	Heeey!
</p>

<p>
	Today I was talking with <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/9622-misanthrope/&amp;do=hovercard" data-mentionid="9622" href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/profile/9622-misanthrope/" rel="">@Misanthrope</a> about the future, like what kind of jobs would suit us Fascists, how should we organize, how to find compatible girls (I have almost managed to do that last time!) etc. They are starting a <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/7664-white-front-%D0%B1%D1%8F%D0%BB-%D1%84%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%82/" rel="">new organization</a> with another Bulgarian guy but since I was never a member of any organizations I couldn't really help them. Some of us are daydreaming about moving to uninhabited places to quit modern decadency and serve the cause from there, I remember that we were talking about this too.

	Yesterday Slavros went full Berzerk on discord because I was arguing for the idea of one Fascist world government while he said that's Globalist bullshit and the ideal situation would consist more Imperiums according to each civilization. It's kinda like the old Catholic-Orthodox duality, one suppors a worldly representation of the Divine Authority while the other states that no worldly authority can represent the Divine thus the power should be divided between the leaders of different people. He told me to read up this <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/4685-emperor-of-the-world/" rel="">thread</a> so that's what I will do, but I still have to find my book by Evola to continue with that.

			So, I'm about 95% done with the message. Will send it soon in a few days. I wanted to give you a heads-up though: it has accumulated to the point of reaching almost 9000 words, so I'm thinking of cutting some chunks out to make it easier on you. Would you prefer that, or the full version?

	Yes, that's me, I am 26.

	I was referring to you with that line about the mountains.
