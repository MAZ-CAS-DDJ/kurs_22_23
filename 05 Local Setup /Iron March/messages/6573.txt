<p>I'm familiar with gornahoor but not the others. They put out some quality pieces. Will look into the other two, thanks.<br /><br />I'm familiar with perennial tradition as well, I was just curious when you said "only religion that has ties to the European identity" etc etc. when you could say that Indo-European religions (Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Paganism, etc.) are more explicitly European, whereas Christianity seemed to take on many European aspects.</p>

<p>I don't see how I'm that "kind of dude" (I'm not at all against esotericism, not sure why you would assume this) but I guess it's fair to assume that most people won't care as much. I am actually interested in such things, I've just always had an ongoing mental conflict in regards to Christianity ever since I got into the fascist narrative. </p>

<p>Thanks for responding.</p>
