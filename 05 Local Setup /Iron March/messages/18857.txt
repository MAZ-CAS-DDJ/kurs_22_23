	Most Polish people, that is Sunday Christians, don't really care about Pope's liberal views. In fact, they are happy about it, because they think they can now divorce and fornicate all they want, because "God is merciful". However, a lot of people, even these Sunday Christians don't agree with Francis's stance on rapefugees. Me, and other Catholic Traditionalists are also struggling, but we try to differntiate between what Pope says ex cathedra and what are his personal opinions. The best solution is to find a local Traditionalist parish and work within the community. I found one in my town with a prelate who performs Tridentine mass and is also a staunch nationalist. You can watch one of his homilies here (with English subtitles), it's about islamic invasion in Europe
