<p>Well my father was always pretty libertarian/anti-government, and i had an interest in the punk rock scene from a young age, so anarchism seemed the way to go for me since i was as young as 10, all the way up until about 13 or 14. I never thought of it as being the liberal cess-pool of filth that i see it as now back then, in fact i was always pretty conservative (except for a small period of time right before i became a fascist, where i was almost headed down the path of being a liberal). </p>

<p>I'm over all of that crap now, have been for about 2 years. </p>
