<p>Well I didn't look at the website itself I just found a digital copy of the book via google search so you could look at the text I needed to have translated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you mean stuff on esotericism or more of what the book is like then just read Evola's spiritual writtings: The Hermetic Tradition, Doctrine of Awakening, Yoga of Power. Would suggest reading Mysteries of the Grail beforehand.</p>

<p>I wouldn't trust these websites themselves, I've come to learn exactly where all the misconceptions and illusions on Evola's writtings come from so evolafags or people who just reference him for their narrative typically got it all wrong. Unless that website is just archiving materials on the subject matter that's similar to the contents of the book I linked you to, those are worth reading if you already are in the known on their symbolic language, if not then I suggest reading the Hermetic Tradition first.</p>
