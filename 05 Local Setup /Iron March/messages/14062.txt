	I think someone shared a video of them in an antifa bashing thread on /pol/ that and I was looking into British Fascist movements, wondering if there were any modern groups, seeing the quote about "lots of foreign money behind their operation" and some "scary" stuff from the cucks made me pretty interested. /pol/ on 4chan and 8chan has gotten pretty stale, I browse 8chan brit/pol/ I wont lie, mainly just to shit post but sometimes the discourse is alright.
