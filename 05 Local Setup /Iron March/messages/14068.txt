	Great. I think the guys on /pol/ just need some energy, when they look at British politics, they see the 70's when the National Front had regular marches in every city, and skinheads both left and right duked it out in alleys, we don't have that anymore, but it's pointless dressing up in docs and shaving our heads now, they need something fresh, something brand new. Though I do think some of the stuff like "fuck V-E day" were a bit too edgy for them, as not everyone loves Hitler.
