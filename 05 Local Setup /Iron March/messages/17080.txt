	Hello, I am a new member here as well. I made a similar albeit more extensive case for the restoring of dignity and usefulness to homosexuals in society etc., and got about the same response: "You are wrong", with no argument attached. I thought perhaps it was just something I said but that now seems to be more of a trend here. Good luck to you if you stick around, I've noticed accounts with hundreds of posts that wind up in the gas chamber, so I'll be keeping my head down ...Â
