<p>Oh, and I have met some nationalists who feel it is important to <em>separate themselves</em> from Westerners. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They resent the power of influence that the West has but do not blame the West. Rather, they view it as just what naturally happens -- as a people they have had massive influence from the Japanese or Chinese at different times and they understand that whoever has the predominant power tends to influence their nation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rather, they focus on maintaining Korean cultural practices as much as they can. Some of them celebrate ther birthdays on the lunar calendar, many of them minimize the amount of Western food or film they watch and they consciously do things like avoid using Western loan words (or even Chinese based phraseology). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They tend to also make a very big deal out of spending their money on expensive Korean food and drinking only the more traditional and expensive liquor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And, for instance, the Nationalist bands over here almost always name themselves in their own tongue and sing exclusively in their own language (e.g. Samchung, Hyeolmaeng).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rahter than a full on resentment there is a conscious reassertion of their own identity.</p>
