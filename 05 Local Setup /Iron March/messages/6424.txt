<p>I haven't got a blog up at the moment, no. I'm currently attending a few meetings here and there whilst digesting as much literature as I possibly can. Before I commit to a serious project I wish to make sure that I understand the current 'Rightist' sub-culture and that my ideas are properly formed. I've had a few articles go viral, the Identitarian movement seemed to appreciate one of them in particular and I had a few requests to have it translated. A rough copy of it can be found here, you may find it interesting although I churned it out in about twenty minutes after attending a conference - <a href="http://thebeerbarrel.net/threads/essential-features-of-a-revolutionary-nationalism.24799/" rel="external nofollow">http://thebeerbarrel.net/threads/essential-features-of-a-revolutionary-nationalism.24799/</a></p>

<p>The Traditional Britain Group, despite having a High Tory core, seems to be developing a reputation for getting all non-egalitarian and traditional factions under one roof. I've been impressed with what they've been up to, you may want to have a look.</p>

<p>As for de Benoist and Faye, I agree that their worldviews are, ultimately, opposed. But each comes, broadly speaking, from the same philosophical tendency. Said tendency has made much progress on the Continent, and in the States. England, unfortunately, has only really had Michael Walker's 'Scorpion Magazine' which seems to have gone quiet. I'll admit, Faye's 'Why We Fight' touched upon many of my sensibilities, and his call for an all-European Identitarian movement/party appeals to me. We must begin, as Englishmen, to foster close relations with the inegalitarian tendencies in Europe but also, in my opinion, begin to sow the seeds for a professional vanguard and tightlyknit cells of operations.</p>

<p>If we can get away from the knuckle-dragging tendencies, if we can surpass the little-Hitlers with their psuedo-projects, this country could give rise to a movement that makes a mockery of the claim that England is "The rock upon which all revolutions are broken."</p>
