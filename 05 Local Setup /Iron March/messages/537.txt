<p>Ah, well thank you. A lot of members use this as some kind of Dungeos and Dragons replacement where they can live out this fantastical world of glorious revolution where they are marching around in 1930sthe uniforms. It is ridiculous. Then, the minute you get into the nuts and bolts in an attempt to discuss real, workable ideas you get labelled as some kind of G.O.P. psuedo-fascist wannabe. They have zero understanding of how politics, real politics work.</p>
<p>Look at the USSR, when the Bolsheviks came to power, they understood communism to be this long term, attainable economic and spitirual goal. But they also knew that you cannot just jump in and set up shop and radically alter people's lives. They started slowly and despite the radically different ideas of men like Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Bukharin, etc. they managed to run a functional, working government. How did they do this? By viewing themselves as a transitional vanguard party. I have been toying around with this concept and adapting it towards a fasicst framework. </p>
<p>We live in a time where anti-modernist ideas have zero support and the majority of the world's governments are openly hostile to fascist and other "far-right" groups. You have to practice realpolitik and crypto-fascism. This is how you use the system to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>For me, fascism is the expression of the collective will of individuals. It is what happens when citizens quit working as individual cells and begin functioning like one organism. Fascism is more than Mussolini or Franco or what have you, it is, above all else, this kind of internal drive man has towards social order and group cohesion. The real fascist is selfless and does his duty with zeal simply for the glory and continual propagation of the State. There is no higher goal or aim.</p>
