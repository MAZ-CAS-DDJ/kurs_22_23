	Personally I wouldn't use the word "modern" as something negative. Yeah, the <strong><em>current</em></strong> modern world is by all means degenerate, but that doesn't mean that i'll treat the words "modern" and "degenerate" as synonyms.

	After all, the Third Reich was a modern society too (I mainly like watching documentaries about Wunderwaffen, for example the Horten Ho 229 bomber was decades ahead of its time). I strongly believe that the society needs to progress and move forward instead of backwards, just in a different direction than it's moving now. But when it comes to science and technology, as long as they serve the right cause, we can develop Wolfenstein-like cyborg super soldiers for all I care...
