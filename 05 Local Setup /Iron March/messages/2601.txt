As far as I'm concerned - most Slavs are basically brothers to Germanics. We are the two strongest peoples in Europa..although I can't say I'm too fond of the Polish, regardless of everything.

<p>"Kaliningrad" should definitely be either German or Lithuanian, moskals have no business there. About the Poles I can't say anything bad. We had our differences and sorted them out like men, nowadays our relations are pretty good (except maybe for some stupid ass keyboard-warriors who in reality have no say neither in Ukainian nor Polish nationalism). I don't take sides regarding German-Polish disputes since I respect both.</p>
