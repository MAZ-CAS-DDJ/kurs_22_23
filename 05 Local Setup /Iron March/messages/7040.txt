<div>Ach, you sound like you really were not well! I think it was the beers that cured you. Yes, that seems correct, doesn't it? ;] And Greece, eh! Do you travel much? And what are all the languages you speak? When I answer your message, I think, 'Ugh, his English is perfect!' Always jealous of all you Europeans speaking half a dozen languages... I only speak fluent English, decent Spanish, and babby's first Swedish.<br /><br />Our accent, now that you ask.. See this is the strange thing... we are known for having the most neutral accent in America. We almost have no accent. They send news reporters here to study and imitate our accent-less voices. Of course, it probably will sound like an accent to you! I'll search up a recording when I get a chance.<br /><br />Almost like a real Croat?! Be still, my beating heart! xD Now, you must tell me what Croatian food is! All I know is what my father has told me: sausage and beer, and brains and eggs. Also salty onions. Or maybe that is Austria...</div>
