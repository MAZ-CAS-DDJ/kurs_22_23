<p>First round of questions:</p>
<p>Obviously I have to ask this: What attracted you to National Socialism? To Golden Dawn?</p>
<p>You've said you have a negative impression of white nationalism. What are your main areas of contention with them? Is it more their tactics or is there something else about their philosophy that bothers you?</p>
<p>Do you subscribe to pan-europeanist type ideas? </p>
<p>Do you agree with the idea of "organic democracy"? From what I understand that's part of the program offered by your party.</p>
<p>What do you think should be (or are) the limits of state power? That is, do you believe there are areas the state should just not bother with or stay out of? </p>
<p>What do you think are the most self-destructive tendencies within your movement/party? Conversely, what do you think are the strengths of Golden Dawn and Greek National Socialism?</p>
