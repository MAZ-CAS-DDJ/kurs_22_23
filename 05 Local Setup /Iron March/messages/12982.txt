	True, but always remember that National Action started with three people and a banner back in 2013. I would strongly suggest reading 'ATTACK' which is basically a how-to guide to things ranging from propaganda to organisation structure, it's really good, and was written by Benjamin Raymond, the leader of <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> and an admin on Iron March.

	In terms of numbers and growth, there's a few active Aussies on Iron March that are very disenfranchised because of a lack of a solid NS movement, if you came to them and showed that you had a vision and are ready to take proper action for National Socialism, I'm sure many of them would get on board.

	You don't need that many people to cause a shit storm, all you need is good propaganda and a good location. The propaganda could be printed from any printer, and make sure to use sticker paper, and place it at unis or busstops. This will get it all over the news, bringing traffic to your site,Iron March and group.  What this means is, that even though you Aussies are far away from eachother you can still participate in activism for the group as single cells, until the chapter grows.
