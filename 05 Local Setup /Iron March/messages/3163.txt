<p>So fascism's definition (just like socialism) has been corrupted over time, to the point that it seems like no one knows what fascism actually is.  </p>
<p>I know that it is an totalitarian, military, nationalistic state, but what other characteristics apply to it?  Old empires of the world have those characteristics, so the some Islamic countries, but I don't think they qualify as fascists.  Is Pinochet fascist?  Are extreme neocons fascist?  Thanks in advance!</p>
