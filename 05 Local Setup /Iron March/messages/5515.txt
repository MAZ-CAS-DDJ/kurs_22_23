<p><span style="font-size:12px;">"I'm half autistic and only like food in a pre-wrapped, yellow package." </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:12px;">hahahh oh fuck</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:12px;">While MP has made 'alliances' with a lot of groups that deserve the rope, i suppose the</span><em> best </em><span style="font-size:12px;">case scenario is that by next year he has drawn some of the brighter members from them and they've shaped up into a decent group.  At this point what he desperately needs is just warm bodies to fill out his protest lines, to</span><em> </em><span style="font-size:12px;">animate his social media pages, they all don't have to necessarily agree, just useful idiots for building the early momentum.  I'd suppose this is the best case for the 'hug box' strategy although I really don't see him being able to draw any quality people from the groups he has associated with so far.  The fact that he is stepping into a such a vacuum of power/sanity certainly has been to his benefit at first,  but is ultimately the challenge.  The american wn scene is very stale and can not be rehabilitated  in my opinion.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:12px;">As you said, I agree that orthodoxy and white nationalism arent going to catch on in the US, much less combined.  I think it would have to be a very localized effort of building social capital, not sign waving"activism." But that is just me. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:12px;">"</span><span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;">needs to start learning from the far-left" <br /><br />Do you mean the 'march through the institutions' of cultural marxism?  Or do you the types of activism and symbolism that the left always claims as being plagiarized from them (squatting, sabotage, animal rights,black bloc etc off the top of my head)<br /><br />Lastly, what are your thoughts on TradYouth's use of the Eurasian Movement's symbol?  Maybe It has other meanings but I'm essentially sure that's what the allusion is to.  Duginism in itself is a massive farce so it will be interesting to see it fall apart under the far right ideologues who have been taking it seriously lately, including MP.  So is it something they're planning to really name drop to wow the WN's or is it less significant?</span></p>
