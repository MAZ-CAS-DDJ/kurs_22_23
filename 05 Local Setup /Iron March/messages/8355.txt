I still have 2 invites left if you would like one (<a href="http://keybase.io" rel="external nofollow">http://keybase.io</a> it's basically GnuPG encryption where your public key is a username that you can attach to your social media accounts, github, websites, whatever to validate it being you).</p></div></div></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Sure, I wouldn't mind having an invite, do you need an email address to send it to?</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Yep, make sure it's the email you want your public profile attached to since this profile should follow you through the Internet for years to come.</p>

<p>Even any public profiles I use were made using disposable email addresses or email addresses I specifically made for the purpose. Thanks for the consideration though.</p>
