	Well shit you did your homework.<br />
	I'm more of a Ricarte guy though.<br />
	Spaniards were based, America brought only cancer.<br />
	Philippines never had fascist movements. The KKK were literally just the American founders blended with Masonic autism.<br />
	Independence was a mistake. <br />
	We're not even a nation, we're just random groups of people mashed together by Spaniards.<br />
	I don't think fascism can apply to a country like mine, we're basically still a colony. <br />
	Only thing I can think of for us is a Malay supernation which wouldn't work all that well since we're majority Christian.
