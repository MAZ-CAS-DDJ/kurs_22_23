<p>You really do have a point, but i'd honestly rather stay and fight, even if i fail. My ancestors came here hundreds of years ago from England. It's been so long now, that i can't go back and call myself an Englishmen. I'm an American, and this is really the only nation i can be in and say "Yes, i am in fact a real American". </p>

<p>You're a lucky one, really, because you actually have the option to return to Russia and say "Yes, i am a genuine Russian". </p>

<p>The only way America will ever have a chance, is if we get our very own Austrian painter (maybe not actually from Austria, but you get what i'm saying) who is somehow able to make a movement that gets big, get's the people's attention, and is able to speak to people and really connect with them and give them inspiration in a way that only a true leader is able to do. </p>
