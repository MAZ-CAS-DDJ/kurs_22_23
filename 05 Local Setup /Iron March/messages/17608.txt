	Can my introduction thread be deleted? My field is too narrow and specific, especially being in Western Canada. I realize I need to do more to conceal myself until I'm prepared. If it means that my account needs to be deleted I can accept that. It would afford me more time to read your resources and familiarize myself with what I need to know.
