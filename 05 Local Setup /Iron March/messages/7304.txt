<p>I just recently heard of Griffin stepping down, now a good a time as any now he's already wrecked the BNP he's done a favour giving chairmanship to someone so incompetent, it'll put it in a grave pretty swiftly - most people have already moved from BNP to UKIP. NA is great as a youth movement - I think it was you or vlad who said a while ago that old people should step aside from nationalism since they're out of touch, they can live the cushy life and keep things like HDI, GDP and local purchasing power ticking over - basically the boring stuff while we actually change peoples minds.</p>
<p>I think hospitals would be a good thing to hit up a little later down the line, as risky as it may be. I worked in the NHS and worked regularly with the incidents, complaints and compliments. You see it now and then on the news and it's well known amongst us but the figures speak for themselves that non-white consultants and doctors fuck up and have the most formal complaints against them (particularly Indians, not so much Singaporeans, chinks and Africans). If not hospitals then just GP surgeries. Put in some leaflets with figures in them or staple them to any audit sheets you can see. Datix is typically the reporting systems hospitals use so try to get some NA members into hospital admin roles where they'll be using Datix. That will get exposure and it's not too much of a vocal method of getting info out and it can be done for a long period of time without being caught out. It will spook them.</p>
<p>That's the other reason I love Venezuela so much <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> Not even mentioning the very reasonable drug laws. It was a choice between here and Malaysia but I just went with what I'm familiar with; I didn't feel like taking a gamble with Malaysian Airlines poor track record either. Getting on your feet isn't hard, especially with a good sum already in a bank account but some of the price differences for general living costs can be a pain in the ass. Luckily petrol isn't much, neither stuff like booze or cigs. As far as cash alone is concerned Malaysia probably would have been the better choice.</p>
<p>As for NA living quarters, get a place in Bradford - property is dirt cheap and right in the faces of the worst kind of shit skins - chavvy, dumb muslim scum.</p>
