	Thanks, man.   I'm lurking for now.  Getting a lay of the land.   I knew you, Zeiger, Hyperborian and Doctor Mayhem posted here and that was the main reason I wanted to check it out. I talk to Hyperborian a bit and skype and he's a great guy. The layout and usability on Ironmarch is better.  Ironmarch is a much smoother site. There are a lot of great resources on here as well.  Just finished reading Siege.  Not joking.  It was pretty good.

	I guess you're persona non grata over at TRS.  Fag stuff still comes up every now and then.    I don't understand what kind of interest fags have in preserving the white race when they no biological stake in it.   People underestimate how destructive entryism is and keeping a check on homos is important.  Someone said that Mike Enoch wanted to allow you back on the forum but it was SventhSon that nixed that idea.
