<p>Well, I am not for sure which of the artists are redpilled or if any of them are. They definitely use the aesthetic but I think in a more respectful and true way as compared to Laibach (which they use too much communist symbolism imo). Obviously, these artists have not come out as saying they are Fascist, however they do not deny it either. I'll give you the link to an article that popped up when I googled "Von Thronstahl interview". I will admit that I have not read it completely but have skimmed through it. If you read it let me know what you think. I'll post the link towards the end of my message. Some of Von Thronstahl's songs have obvious Fascist themes, like Age of Decay and Democracy, Hail Thy Captain and Thy Guard (about the Iron Guard), Dressed in Black Uniforms (which I actually use as my ringtone), and even a song called Respect the Hierarchy (which I have not heard but it is one a CD that I just ordered Wednesday, supposedly it is about Evola. As for the other groups I just don't know, but like I said they haven't denied it either. Anyways here is the article link for you and I hope it helps. Remember I myself just skimmed it, so let me know what you think. <a href="http://4ibrecords.com/2013/08/15/von-thronstahl-interview-the-search-for-truth-heathen-harvest/" rel="external nofollow">http://4ibrecords.com/2013/08/15/von-thronstahl-interview-the-search-for-truth-heathen-harvest/</a>     </p>
