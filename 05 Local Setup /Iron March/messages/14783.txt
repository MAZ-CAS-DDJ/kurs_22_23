	Him and Slavros had an argument and Ben gassed him I wasn't there for that. I found Ironmarch a long time ago when I was 17 my first three accounts were gassed until IÂ learned to chill the fuck out and read some materials, but in my defense they really hadn't figured out a good initiation process yet, it wasn't uniformed and they hadn't really figured out the goal of the site yet back then. I've been on and off since like 2011 , this account is the first time I've really been accepted into the website.
