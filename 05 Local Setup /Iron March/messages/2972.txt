<p>Of course I've read <em>Der</em><em> Judenstaat</em>, and I'm glad you are too. Herzl's original vision should be read by all Zionists, Jew and non-Jew alike. It provides a clear set of guidelines for the creation of an ethnically homogenous Jewish state.</p>
<p>As to Revisionist Maximalist writings, there's not much out there. Very few people look on it as anythin but a curiosity today. However, I can reccommend [sic] Abba Ahimeir's excellent article <em>The Great Shofar Blast</em>, which you can find on the Save Israel website. <em>The Jewish Radical Right</em>, by Eran Kaplan, is little left-slanted, but provides a great overview of the goals and ideology of the Revisionist Maximalist movement.</p>
<p>As to modern Jewish nationalism, anything by Meir Kahane is a must. He is absolutely the best when it comes to Jewish nationalism, and I highly reccommend anything h has written. Samsonblinded.org has a great archive of his writings and videos.</p>
