	You seem to be speaking pretty well already.<br />
	I probably can't help much when it comes to studying grammar (except for providing examples of how it's used and correcting it if you'd like) men vad gäller att utöka ditt ordförråd så bör jag kunna stå till tjänst.

	What resources do you currently use for studying the language?<br />
	I usually use Memrise when trying to study vocabulary, it's a bit like Duolingo except users can make their own courses.
