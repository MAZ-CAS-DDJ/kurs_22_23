<p>Speaking of ancestry, I was looking at my family history a few days ago (we have an actual physical family tree on paper) and the first Australian in my family was a Welsh convict named William Poulter who arrived here in the 18th century. You shouldn't even be talking to me, I'm clearly a base-bred rogue.</p>

<p>Devi... Lol, no... Just no. That wouldn't work. That'd be too esoteric, it would hurt her head. She's not the spiritual type of hippie, entirely materialistic. Literally can't understand the reasoning of anything beyond total individualism. Hence libertarian.</p>

<p>Never listened to black metal? Wow, I don't normally meet people like you anymore. How odd. That's what you would call a "raw" kind of black metal, as opposed to something more symphonic like mainstream stuff. One of the guys from Forest went on to form Temnozor. (which is more folk)</p>

<p>I can sing Moscow nights in Russian, by the way. Nobody will ever hear it outside the shower though. I sang one time infront of people in a bar in the Philippines. Never again.</p>
