	I read both the thread and the texts by Evola Slavros was referring to, but there wasn't much about the worldly application of those ideals we were talking about, although it's funny that Evola mentioned how the Aryans have to establish an <strong>ecumenical</strong> hierarchy of races. Also, Slavros writes:

			To rally those loyal to the King beneath his banner and take the Kingdom back in his name must come a Lord Regent (<em>a Man Against Time kind of leader, think to any fascist leader like Hitler, Mussolini, Mosley, Codreanu and etc and you see in them that Regent regardless if they lead a state or a movement</em>) because for a King to come back he needs a Kingdom to come back to (<em>our struggle to usher in a temporal manifest of our worldview</em>).

	I don't know if he is implying that those leaders are quasi-equal or not, but even if I believe that Hitler was superior to all of them, I still don't know one thing, namely that if Fascism would have won the war, would Hitler himself accept the role of leading all of the nations uniting them in one Empire or would he rather stick with Europe or maybe only Germany?
