<p>Could you explain something abou that video? I mean like, why is Alexandre Gabriac behind all of those police and Antifascist are there too.</p>
</div></div></blockquote>
<p>Well this video is essentially some anti-fascists alert that Gabriac is supposedly well treated by the media because he gets exposure. I imagine that the pics of him with police are at some manifestation he was at and the police had to protect him from antifa.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>In all honesty though I don't know that much about Gabriac. I think I read something about him some time ago but I don't think he's particularly influential, so he doesn't come up much in my sources.</p>
