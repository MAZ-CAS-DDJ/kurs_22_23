<p>When I was a child I lived at a farm and there where no niggers (except for two), jews or whatsoever. Everything was how it should be, at least I thought. When I was thirteen we moved to a little city, with a lot of foreigners. I read Vargsmal and that was the moment when I began to think NS. The first years I knew nobody who thought the same way and had no desire to go in the 'gabber'-scene (dutch scene with a lot of people who say they are against foreigners but don't know shit). Till I was on a concert in flanders (when I was 17  or 18), where I met the leader of 28 of flanders and the leader of 28 worldwide. In a short period of time I was introduced to almost everyone of the scene in flanders and holland, not only 28. How about you?</p>

<p>The far right movement in Holland knew better times, but I tell you more about that when we'll meet.   </p>

<p>Haha...  with 'not the most intellectual week' I mean a group of people who act like a bunch of skinheads, but most of them are really smart. For some reason they think that the week in Hungary, is a week when they have to drink as much as is possible.. haha. They'll do some sightseeing and meet a lot of people of the far right movement, but the underline is comeradeship (with the excuus of a memorial).</p>
