	Yeah, though I still have a bad feeling that I am going to have to do the online dating thing once I graduate. Pretty much plan a at this point tbh. Still think my chances of finding someone more ideologically aligned with me would be improved online. May have to do that and continue to look in real life. Pretty much decided to do online dating at this point.
