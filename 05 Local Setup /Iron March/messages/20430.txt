	Hello!
</p>

<p>
	After seeing a few videos about the polish independence day riots, we think about coming over from germany this year.
</p>

<p>
	Could you tell me if it is safe as german? In the movement we hear a lot about anti-germanism in poland.
</p>

<p>
	And will it be like the last years? I mean, you now got a "right wing" goverment.
</p>

<p>
	Heil from Thuringia
