	Sorry if I don't understand fully but I am trying. I understand the abstract portion, I just struggle to see how it's applied.  I thought socialism was partial government control for the means of production, so equality is not apart of the equation in itself? In one of the books I read today it said that Fascism can be both totalitarian and anarchic, as a tool. So basically Fascism is just whatever the people want? If the people are struggling with an outside force and the people demand a controlled economy then it just happens?, and when there is no struggle and people want a free'er economy its just what happens naturally? Isn't that just state democracy/populism or demo-cracy (people rule)?
