<p>Dear Sir Parrott of the Knights of Avalon</p>
<p>I am but a humble Shintoist/Buddhist East Aryan hailing from the land of the rising sun. I can trace my lineage to the famous Samurai Sanada Yukimura and I hope to be a warrior just like him, adept at the art of war as well as that of peace. I am currently studying for a college degree in the United States and my curiosity was piqued by your organization. I would like to settle your kingdom in martial spirit in order to help develop it. Would it be possible for me to become an Avalonian Knight so I can assist in your most noble cause?</p>
<p>I am however, concerned about the theological aspects of such an arrangement. Is it possible for me to keep my traditional Shinotist gods and buddhist practices while at the same time practicing Orthodoxy? Would your Orthodox god allow it to be worshipped alongside my ancestors? Does he recognize the late divinity of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor?</p>
<p>Thank you very much, hope to see you in knighthood</p>

<p>Dear 昭五式,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your faith would necessarily be in communion with global Orthodoxy to be eligible for initiation. It's not my call, but I doubt a church which so thoroughly integrated Japanese folk religion into its theology would be accepted as Orthodox. One of the beautiful things about Orthodox Nationalism is that it does strive to integrate its liturgy and practice with the folk and the land. I envision Orthodoxy in Japan being the ideal way to integrate your unparalleled history and heritage into Christ's one true Church...but worshiping God as merely one among many is certainly heretical.</p>
<p>Ideally, His Imperial Majesty the Emperor would accept Christ into his heart and personally braid the two traditions together into an invincible fasces. I'll pray for that this evening, for the Emperor to become a Constantine of the Far East. If your research draws you closer to Orthodoxy, and draws you to reconcile Orthodox Christianity with your Shinto and Buddhist traditions, we'll be eager to not only welcome you as a fellow knight, but help you establish a platform for that message and vision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It wouldn't be Knights of Avalon, <em>per se</em>, as the Avalonian nation and kingdom is particular to the Anglo-American people. But we in the Knights of Avalon absolutely <em>promise</em> a tremendous amount of support for parallel legions 'round the world.</p>

<p>Here's some interesting reading on Orthodoxy's limited involvement in Japan:</p>
