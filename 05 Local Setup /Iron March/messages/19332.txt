			<span style="font-size:11px;">"The brainchild of Craig and Lucy Fraser and Paul Waggener, The Centurion Method is a comprehensive fitness programme and a self-esteem boosting series of essays designed to cultivate an esoteric, warrior-like mindset in the reader. When crowdfunded, this book achieved over twice the money requested; and has thus shown decisively that there is a market for our ideals. It formed the cornerstone of the two camps run by <a href="https://www.radixjournal.com/blog/2014/9/7/sigurds-culture-camp" rel="external nofollow">Sigurd</a> - an organization whose website has unfortunately gone offline. I regret missing both of those camps quite bitterly, but console myself with the fact that the creators of the programme made this excellent book free to download. Well worth a look.</span>

			<span style="font-size:11px;">Since I downloaded this book, Sigurd's website has disappeared and all of the copies of the physical edition have long since sold out. This thread is quite possibly one of the only active download links for this particular document. I encourage all of you to save a copy and disseminate it."</span>
