<p>I don't mind compromising my own happiness or wellbeing if it means a large section of the world is much better off.</p>

<p>Besides, I'm pretty convinced that nothing as extreme as what's being promoted on this site will happen. The powers that be are doing a pretty good job of normalising the idea that wanting anything other than the status quo is treason, and you can and will be prosecuted for having a dissenting opinion.</p>

<p>Things could go pretty badly, in a place like France say, it's not unlikely that the whites will lose and by the time they feel like doing anything they'll be outnumbered. I imagine more than one European country will go down this route. Honestly I don't want to see that happen. I enjoy not living in a third world country, white people have built and maintained the society I live in and I'm grateful for that. If England became majority, or 40% non-white I would probably leave. The numbers are inarguable, non-whites are in general not good for society. Now, you can debate the cause all you want but the fact is that if the cause is genetic or social nothing will be done about it. The current system advocates non-interference (taking it up the butt) and this opposing system advocates genocide.</p>

<p>The future is bleak whatever way you look at it, I'd just rather that civilisation was left intact at my personal expense than the destruction of everything that has ever been worked for so I can continue to live exactly where I want to.</p>
