<p>Assuming you're not a troll, what do you attempt to prove? Your assault on iron march has been one of ethos-through-pathos, certainly not one an intelligent Marxist would take. While I can't take as faith you're serious, I can assume it for this conversation. Why should I take your emotionalism seriously; more specifically, why should a liberal assume you're serious and not just extremist infighting?</p>
