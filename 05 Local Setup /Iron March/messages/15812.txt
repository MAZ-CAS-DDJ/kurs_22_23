	Dear friend,
</p>

<p>
	I am vary thankful that you will help guide me in the right direction, I cant thank you enough.
</p>

<p>
	Just for the record, the women who' funeral I was at when I got that feeling, was the only true christian I know. And that makes me even more convinced that god is real.
</p>

<p>
	I am ready for a hard life, because if god exists, then it's the only right thing to is to become a dedicated Christian.
</p>

<p>
	I know that god created everything, light and darkness, everything. I'm not sure why he came to earth. And I think he care about us because, as you say, he loves us like just as much as our parents loves us.
</p>

<p>
	And feel free to ask what ever you would like to know about me.
</p>
