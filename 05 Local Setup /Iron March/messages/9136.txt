<p>Aha I'm no expert but I am visually minded. Some of the guys on here are great and I've tried getting them on board but they're all faggot americans trying to suck Alex's cock and are thus too busy to actually do anything.</p>

<p>But yes I'd love to help. One thing I'd love to see is Sigurd focussing on their surroundings: they train in the wild, so why not learn how to live in the wild? That would be a great asset to any NS group, especially when shit hits the fan and we have to cause revolt old school guerilla style. If you're interested, Morana (my gf) and I would gladly lend our knowledge. I have high hopes for Sigurd, and given some of the circles I move in I could get a handful of decent guys to help you out, old friends of Craig's if I remember correctly. They've wanted to resurrect it for a while. Most of the Sigurd bunch were O9A btw, we just kept it quiet. There's so much potential in it, shame so many have a limited view on what it actually is.</p>

<p>The rites you speak of bring an amazing level of self-insight and really push you. Just having to research everything I'll need for the 3 months (The rite of Internal Adept) has seen me have to learn loads about foraging and bushcraft and thus I've ended up smarter, with a better appreciation of Nature around me. Essentially it's about coming to really know yourself, and thus others and then the universe itself. If you ever want, I can email you some of the O9A guides and texts. Just let me know <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>As for human sacrifice, we call it culling and believe it's necessary to remove the degenerate elements from a society. Not so different to Fascism <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>As for graphics, I'll see what I can do. Got any ideas?</p>
