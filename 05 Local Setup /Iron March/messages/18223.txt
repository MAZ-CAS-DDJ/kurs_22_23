	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	I noticed some of your posts and also your banner and I have some questions if you don't mind. I noticed that you are from France and I was just wondering how people in France especially Nationalists view the OAS? Also do you know where I can find some good information in English on the OAS? There isn't much information available in English were I am from. Also, I know you already answered a similar question but what do you think of Baise ma Hache?
