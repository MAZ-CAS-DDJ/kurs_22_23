<p>Sorry for the late reply mate, well Kalash is taking a break so I had to haphazardly manufacture a couple designs using my iPhone, the plan was for me and my mate to head out early and put them up along the parade route, he bailed on me so I decided to head out myself and put three up outside the bank on the main street, with masking tape, as everything was damp/moist from the rains and dew, well there lies a big problem as nothing bloody sticks to the moist surface....after seeing those three flop I decided to spare the rest untill I had an easy and sturdy adhesive. There're were cops and pedestrians everywhere, even at 330 am... Made for some interesting onlookers, mostly old boomers trying to adjust their eyes so they could give them a read haha! I'll see if they are sill up when I head down there later, Anyway hope you enjoy the long weekend mate! Haha shit that's right you guys don't get one </p>
