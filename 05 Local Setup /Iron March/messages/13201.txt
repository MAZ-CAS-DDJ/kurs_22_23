<p>Nice! What kind of jobs are you applying for?<br /><br />
Oh definitely. The indigenous peoples of the Americas are fascinating... if somewhat brutal. It does comfort me to know that their descendants often speak the same languages and practice the same farming lifestyle as many within the old empires. I always found Ancient Egypt most interesting as a kid, but at the moment I'm really into Rome. On a (slight) tangent, while I was in Spain I saw that the civil guard has the logo of a crossed fasces and sword under a crown.<br /><br />
Oh. Oh my. That sounds like the story a slightly mean granddad would tell to his grandchildren just before going to bed. Have you ever been out looking for the treasure?</p>
