<p>Amazing post; I'd appreciate it if as and when it's applicable and relates you could post more Central European history on the forums; a better understanding of history is necessary for true nationalism to thrive and for nations to actually work with each other. I openly acknowledge that one of the biggest fuck ups of the British Empire was the Boer war, mainly for how fucking expensive it was and the fact that in the end it was for nothing and we look like dickheads for what we did now because we just let the empire stagnate anyway, we were also on the wrong side of the war; I value people like Mosley and William Joyce as true Brits over Churchill any day.</p>
<p>I agree with you 100% on Russia too, many of them have a Turkish look to them and I know I pissed on a Russian girls parade when I purposefully called her a Turkish whore; especially the further north and east you go; the same sentiments are echoed on many "Mediterraneans" too. Personally I don't like southern Italians that much, despite it not being the reality - every single "Italian" I've met has looked like a fuckin' paki and the "sun tan" excuse wears thin after a while. Mediterranean centrists have an inferiority complex where they explain themselves to nordicists all the time and Nordicists have a superiority complex. I think Madison Grant had a point when he said Med/Nord mixes produced good outcomes and high beauty and he pretty much said the same for Alpine mixes too. Much of the aristocracy in Greece was mixed to varying degrees of Alpine, Med and Nordic, it's hardly a case of outbreeding depression because they're still closely related enough but not too close.</p>
<p>I agree on Poland and anti-NSDAP poles too as they are still genuinely anti-semitic (probably to a greater degree than most nations), loathe communism and love their nation, although of course my bias makes me appreciate NS-Poles a lot more. The problem is we've let a bunch of faggots and people who've nothing to do with our nations writing our history for us instead of making it and writing it ourselves.</p>
<p>In a backhanded way I made my points against Russia in the "Truth about the war" thread from slavic union which I posted, as well as flat out provoking a reaction by romanticising chechens. Russia, like the US and the UK need to be critical about their own history as well. I felt embarrassed when I first came here and every Russian poster was sucking Stalin's dick.</p>
