	Yeah, I'm pretty lucky. 5 months roughly, and I go 1-3 times a week to do training. Heading off to Quebec city really soon for additional training. It's good money - the only reason I'm doing it, not because I give a shit about Canadian values or wtv I hear the other guys saying. In the end I'm just fighting for the Jews but if they're going to pay me to teach me to use all sorts of weapons and get me in shape then I'm in.
