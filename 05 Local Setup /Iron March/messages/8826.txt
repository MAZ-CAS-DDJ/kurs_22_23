<p>OH SHIT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS HERE. I don't actually, fish and cauliflower are the two things I can't stand to eat. I don't mind squid if that counts? There is a greek cultural festival thing here every year and they make something that is really tasty that is either squid or octopus, i can't remember.</p>

<p>Family "vacation", for my mother to see her boyfriend who lives there. (No, he's american, not a native, thankfully I don't have to put up with that shame) He's a fucking moron who I can't stand, so while they were out doing things I tried to entertain myself in this place I didn't really want to be. There was this big outdoors mall complex-thing, that was actually fancier than anything in my city. Just for the tourists, of course. It's surrounded by miles of slum, the poor people aren't allowed inside. Unless you visit there, you won't believe 1. how many whores there are, 2. how many fat old white guys are there for the whores.</p>
<p>Anyway they had this place that served these really cool juices (since I don't drink) with all these different flavours and they cost almost nothing, so i sat there alot trying all of them and talking to all these women who kept sitting with me about their lives. It was a strange experience. It was also like a free boxing match, the floor below where I sat there was a brawl between a couple of drunk guys fighting over whores every few days. Fun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I went and explored the slum too. There is some... weird shit there. One street there was this guy sitting on what looked like a seriously jury-rigged computer, surrounded by about 20 other guys, playing call of duty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh, one of the cops let me play with his M4, police there just carry rifles around with them on their shoulders everywhere they go</p>

<p>(oh, not really, at least and hour's drive from the sea, but there are either jellyfish or sharks in it depending on the year and it's rarely open for swimming)</p>
