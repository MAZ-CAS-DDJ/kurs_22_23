	Hail, friend!
</p>

<p>
	Ive been meaning to give you a call, it was great meeting you and I'll be in the Burg quite often in the coming weeks so we should meet up again if you have the time. I'll be there this Saturday for example;Â APB members and prospects are required to attend the SusPrep expo this Sunday in Grants Pass, so we'll be down the night before. Here's the link in case you were interested: <a href="https://susprepexpo.com/grants-pass/" rel="external nofollow">https://susprepexpo.com/grants-pass/</a>
