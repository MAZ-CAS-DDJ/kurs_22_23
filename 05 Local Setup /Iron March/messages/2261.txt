<p>Hello. </p>
<p>-Well I don't believe in enforcing social liberalism as far as making people do things they would not want to. Basically I am more into ending criticism and debate about what is "moral". I prefer that whatever people do in their private lives stay relatively private, but also for anything that is meant to be done in private be free from opposition. </p>
<p>-I favor totalitarianism. </p>
<p>-I am not sure if anyone in paticular influences me. But I do admire Adolf Hitler for being able to start such a strong movement out of nothing. </p>
<p>-I think the relationship between religion and state should be that religious establishments be subordinate to the state. For example, in my ideal version of America, I would gladly allow christianity, but it would have to follow the same laws as any individual. Anything condemning non harmful acts would have to be removed from religious doctrine. If not for petty things like this I would still be proud to be Catholic. </p>
<p>-This next one is really hard to answer. I would have to do a lot of reading to figure this out. I can't think of one monarch or dictator that shared anything I believe in. At least I have not come across any yet in books and such.</p>
<p>-For me, being conservative is actually a good thing, when done for the right reasons. </p>
<p>I find regimes like that too intrusive on certain matters though. </p>
<p>-I can't stand them. Communism was and still is a failed system. The idea of trying to create an equal society in that way just keeps the country stagnant. </p>
<p>Thanks. I'm glad you took the time to ask these questions. If there is anything else you would like to know feel free to ask and I will get back to you in my spare time. </p>
<p>By the way, cool country. Really interesting history around it. I'd like to visit Pretoria some day. Have you ever been to the United States?</p>
