	First I'd like to apologise for my imbecile behaviour on my introduction, it was never meant to go that way and it was not my intention to break a rule known as ''Fascist Fetish''

	Second of all, all signs point towards you being a known member, how did youÂ integrate into this community when you were new since I noticed that someone said something regarding faggots and you being tolerant of them before which is why you lost your avatar.

	Sorry if this offends you, I mean no harm.
