	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	I've been thinking about joining National Action (you're one of the leaders, correct?) and I want to ask a few questions.
</p>

<p>
	Does Midlands contain Lincolnshire/Peterborough area?
</p>

<p>
	If yes, how big is the membership around here ( a ball park figure if enough)
</p>

<p>
	Are there any requirements?
</p>

<p>
	Just making sure, is this a group for skins to smoke weed and be anti-social? I've heard otherwise but I don't want to hang around degenerates.
</p>

<p>
	Is it fine that I'm German? Or is it a Top hatter and tea only club?
</p>

<p>
	Any dress codes? I would like to see if I can spot any allies in my area.
</p>

<p>
	Do you have some sort of instant messager  so I can shitpost and harass you? (jk, I just like to talk with people who have some sense.
</p>

<p>
	I am new to the fash community and still developing. But I am a nationalist for sure.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for spending your time to at least read this,
</p>

<p>
	Marty
