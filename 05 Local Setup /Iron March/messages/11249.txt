<p>Nice I had a pretty shit night at the end because one girl got super emotional and stuff and eventually bailed out of a moving car on the highway (we were only going like 20 though so she was fine but still the principle of the thing wtf) so we had to deal with that.</p>

<p>10/10 would go to Paramore themed baptist church. I also recalled recently that when I went to bible summer camp one year one of the counsellors played Underoath all the time (Christian emo band). It was better than the gay generic Jesus songs we had to sing at chapel and campfire.</p>
