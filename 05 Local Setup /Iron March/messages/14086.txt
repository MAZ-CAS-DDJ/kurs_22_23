	Yea mate it is the EYL. We've rebooted it with new leaders and with a more centralised leadership style so we don't end up with Big Egos splitting up the group. And Hobart shit I don't know if we have any boys down there, But I can ask around for you and see if there are any lads you can meet up withÂ
