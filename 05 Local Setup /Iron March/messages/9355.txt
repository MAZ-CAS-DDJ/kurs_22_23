<p>Dear Mengligiraykhan,</p>
<p>This is Blackshirt 13, and I was wondering if I could ask you a question. A while back I posted on the Fascist views on Freemasons thread. In my post I stated that I was a former freemason, however I also said that I left after 1 year and I admitted that joining in the first place was a mistake. I promptly left once I came to the realization that I am a Fascist. I am now totally dedicated to Fascism. My question to you as a member of the Black Corps is, will I be condemned now or in the future over a mistake in my past? I assure you I am a dedicated and true Fascist and I have also completely cut all ties with the freemasons. So how do you as a member of the Black Corps feel about my past? How will other Black Corps members and even the Adimship feel about my past? Anyways I am sorry to bother you and I would really appreciate it if you would write me back.</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>
