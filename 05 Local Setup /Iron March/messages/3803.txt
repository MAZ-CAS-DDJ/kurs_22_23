<p>In a certain form, yes - I am for the involvement of the Church in the national community, hence, in the government, but not as a leading party. I'm for re-working a modern version of the Concordat of 1801 and a state religion. I am not for either entity controlling or domineering the other, and I am for an acknowledgement of separate roles - Church and State are to the nation as Mother and Father are to the family, they have different roles and keep them largely separate, but cooperate.</p>
<p>Less officially, I wouldn't be against the state encouraging the health of Catholic religion.</p>
