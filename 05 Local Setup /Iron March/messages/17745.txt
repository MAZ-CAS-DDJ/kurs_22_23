			There wouldn't be any fascist federal govt. it would be achieving a organic state through right-wing anarchism, as such the US would be fractured into several states w/o the federal that keeps the status quo going. Lies can't survive especially not egalitarianism w/o money constantly feeding the intellectuals at the center of it (ie massive amount of white sellouts working for jews, usually w/o knowing it). Be it funds flowing to academia, media, entertainment, banking, politics, welfare etc or the regulations &amp; agencies forcing it to remain this way. The Midwest wouldn't survive in its current form. It would mainly be New England. What happens is when people can no longer get favourable treatment by using words like racism/sexism/xenophobia and they can't parasite off anyone else? They go to work &amp; live a more modest life. As if by magic the spell wears off. All parasitical classes and many non-whites groups would revolt and be displaced.

			The fascism you speak of is using democracy in order to install totalitarianism (the old way) which means exactly what you say it does ie keeping various govt agencies, industrial, commercial, public and central govt infrastructure in tact. Fascism is counter-revolutionary so it doesn't have to be done the "official" way. This way (that you want) is almost impossible for exactly the reason you say you don't want the anarchist method, because most people don't want "tyranny" &amp; believe democracy can bring them a good life, eventhough democracy blocks the realization of truth by preventing the real right-wing from ever taking power (ethnic nationalism, monarchy, aristocracy and fascism). You replied to the thread on the topic of a "politician" cucking but perhaps you didn't see this reply:

			When in reality the only good life comes either from a benevolent ruler chosen by the people and kept in power by the will of the party (which most people are part of) that can remove falsehoods &amp; represent the highest morals and steer us towards it through existing infrastructure &amp; official channels. The best possible scenario is a block of fascist states of either Dixie or Pacific Northwest race-culture based.

			The second way is to make it so that we have to steer our own lives from the bottom up, by ourselves COMPLETELY LOCALLY with no federal govt.

			Yes I've used that word as well<strong> but being pragmatic</strong> means stoking the fire of white nationalism which is mainly done in a cultural sense. Only then would it have any chance of succeeding in a political sense which would normally mean compromising the message and going by art of what is possible in the political sphere, whether the overton window is there yet and if enough people are aware which is <strong>hardly even registered as a blip </strong>going by the frequency of online searches of new right and alt-right. Hence why the article is used to show that two decades with nothing to show for it isn't exactly the best motivator is it? Cultural libertarian or Trumpism certainly isn't much of a consolation prize. The old way is even more hopeless because of the ingrained belief of egalitarianism which America is founded on. Leaving a few hundred good men &amp; almost zero funds.

			The point of SIEGE is to show that anarchism can do it &amp; it is pragmatic. No need to wait for a reincarnation of the Fuhrer (which arguably already occurred but very few recognize him). It can be done by several groups with genuine leaders who do not have the political mind of the Fuhrer. You haven't shown how the old way (that has repeatedly failed because the system is heavily rigged by various groups top down and bottom up) is pragmatic. People have too much to lose by going against the system even when they are getting backed into a corner.

	I'm curious as to how exactly you'd see a fascist USA come to fruition if it didn't happen through democratic means. Would it be through states seceding?
