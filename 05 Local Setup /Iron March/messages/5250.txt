<p>i read your "likes" page on your profile, and i agree with most of it: national socialism is socialist, and it is a pan-germanic movement, not a "white nationalist" movement. i just wanted to ask a few questions: 1. you call skinheads "homophobic" multiple times. what are your views on homosexuality? 2. you mentioned the video "what is nazism", are you a member of the "apostles of adolf hitler"? 3. how do you feel about marxists socialism? thank you for your time, and i hope to hear your response soon.</p>
