			Nah. I am sure that there were thousands of pro-Yugoslavian Croats, and that there are still thousands who are against the whole Croatian-Serbian opposition.

	Thats sounds very much like "Not all muslims are terrorists". There was very little Croats among loyalists, I think there were far more muslims loyal to the country than Croats actually.

			Yes, and it won't unite until the people who live there won't bury their dead and solve this problem without outer powers, but together with each other. Of course NATO attacked you since Serbia was the unifying force in that region. Croats believed the same lie almost every post-Socialist nation believed at that time, namely that the West only wants to help us. About the Muslims... after the Yugoslav wars the NATO have destroyed Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, at the moment they are spreading chaos in Syria, Ukraine and Turkey. They don't give a shit about religion for they don't have ideals, only interests. Ffs, the average Serbs sees them as pro-Muslim while the average Muslim sees them as Crusaders.

	Well, Serbs didn't believe that west is trying to help us, nor do we think that today. Croats have lost, once the globalist axis of Brussels-Washington breaks, they are alone and at the mercy of regional powers such as Serbia, Italy or Hungary who are legit enough to be backed by new players in Europe. If it wasn't from the NATO we would solve 50% of Balkan problems. We lost and when time comes again we will correct that. I don't see NATO bombing Saudis or Emirates, or Turkey for that matter. They are all sponsors of European muslims, not Syria or Libya.
