	Uh, instead of spamming embed links, here goes a list:<br />
	Sigur Rós, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Isis (a bit on the metal side), Lebensessenz(actually piano only, but he is one of the greatest black metal artists and National Socialists in Brazil, has played live in a post-rock/darkgaze with his piano and a band), Alcest, Agalloch, Amesoeurs, Wolves In The Throne Room, Sólstafir, Burzum (heh), Deafhaven, Russian Circles, Cult of Luna, Pelican, Arctic Plateau, Thränenkind, Year of no Light, Ulver (Shadows of the Sun album), Les Discrets, Lantlôs, Fen, The Echelon Effect, Vision Éternel.<br /><br />
	Some of them are more heavy, black-metal oriented, some have vocals as another instrument, mostly screamed or guttural.

	My absolute favorite is probably this song, which came from a split with Valfunde, another project of Famine from Peste Noire (one of my favorite bands)

	I am also into doom, as it also has a great deal of emotion.
</p>

<p>
	Bands like 40 Watt Sun, Warning, Woods of Ypres...
</p>

<p>
	Feel free to share some too. I have some more to list, but then it would get pedantic, heh...
