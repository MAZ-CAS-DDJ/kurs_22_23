<span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;"> </span></span><p>That would certainly make them relatable, but I'd say lower the time they spend in the ranks.  6+ years is a long-ass time to earn your commission.  I think an enlisted soldier could enter Officer Candidate School in America and have their commission in two years.  </p>
<p>My fear on the corruption of this system isn't that people will come to hold multiple positions, but that some group will be over-represented.  For example, soldiers get a plurality in the citizenship and then vote for lowering the military requirements.  The system is then corrupted into a classist state.  I would say the biggest problem in America isn't that bankers are senators and his son is a colonel (although that happens and it is fucking enraging), but that Rockefeller, Kennedy, and Powell are in the same country club or all own an island in the same archipelago.  Your system seriously cuts back on this by making citizenship a non-inheritable trait, but how is Kennedy going to evaluate Rockefeller's son when he knows Rockefeller from the Syndicate Council meetings and Executive elections.</p>
<p>I'd also like to apologize for giving your system the fifth degree.  I really think this is an awesome system, so I want to know its every nook and cranny.  So please don't get the wrong idea about my incessant questioning of your ideas.  Also, thanks for clearing up  the freedom of expression jazz.</p>
