<p>yeah, true. tacitus at least seemed pretty unbiased so i trust his writings on the germans. are you being sarcastic? kek. and yeah thats true, although he did say "we dont even know who our allies in the middle east are" but thats pretty vague.</p>

<p>Ive danced at parties and school dances but i mean, I wouldnt say Im a dancer haha. I would probably step all over you. Being a few inches taller wouldnt help either. lol maybe, I definitely feel sorta drawn to that kinda thing...im obsessed with studying mythology, history, philsophy, occultism and herbs. not really a botanist yet but i know herbs for a few things and I know the herb chant from england almost by heart now. only one, I had a dream where I got arrested. about a month later I was in jail lol. most my dreams and visions are just sorta weird or dont have prophetic meaning. I see flying snakes made of blue fire very often in my dreams and ive noticed that the earliest forms of the seraphim in the bible are snakes made of fire. not entirely sure what it means, but they always seem friendly to me and usually just hover above me and look at me, sometimes flying in circles around me. TMI WARNING I have sleep paralysis also, basically demons scream at me when I wake up at night, theres your first red flag haha </p>

<p>yeah it would be. i need to move somewhere where theres forests again, deserts are okay by themselves but the people are rotten. not to mention the bugs. all of my textbooks are brainwashing, they cram it in wherever they can now. monarchy is certainly better than democracy but in a way I feel fascism is the evolution of monarchy. its an okay system for sure but always varies on the monarch himself. politics is almost like poker, sometimes a trump card and sometimes a jeb</p>
