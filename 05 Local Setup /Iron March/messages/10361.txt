<p>Is it true that Azov is currently not looking for volunteers? If you are interested then who would I contact in order to join?</p>
<p>I would be interested in volunteering specifically near May of 2016 (as I am a student at university and that is when the courses I'm registered in now end) though I could come earlier or later if that is necessary. I am not wealthy but I can afford my own way there and back and now have a passport.</p>
<p>I am a healthy white Canadian male, 21 years of age (turning 22 in October), with no medical issues that I'm aware of.</p>
