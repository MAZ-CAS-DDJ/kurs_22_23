<p>   Well I think they view NS Germany as the epitome of Fascism because it was successful in many ways, as well as being the focal point of conflict during WWII. The 3rd Reich being so significant in that short period of time has less to do with National Socialism then it has to do with Germany naturally being a dominant central European power.</p>
<p>  The jew-obsession and the pagan fetish seems to stem from this love of Hitler, so they in turn reject Christianity completely, even though Christendom and European identity are one in the same. That is the thing that really irks me about some of these guys, they either choose to forget, or are completely ignorant of, the absolute necessity of some level of religious unity, while the only other religious alternative to Christianity is Islam. Some neopagans are silly enough to think that their racial religion can take hold on a mass scale, which just shows that they don't actually understand religion, seeing as the modern world has been too rationalized to allow for any new religions to be inspired.</p>
<p> You've made a very good point in that thread about the bad blood born out of European wars and nationalism set against each other. A lot of NS people have a pretty simplistic view of it.</p>
