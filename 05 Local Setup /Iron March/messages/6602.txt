<p>So I started reading 'Wolf Totem', an autobiographical novel by Jiang Rong (Lü Jiamin). Curiously, this book was very popular in China and the whole world (it's Turkish translation is known as 'Kurt Totemi'), and it is about the time the author spent living amongst the Mongols and his experiences with wolves.<br /><br />The book talks a lot about and idealizes the culture of the Mongolian steppe nomads while criticizing Han Chinese and for becoming weak, sheep-like, and sedentary. More controversially, the author concludes that the ancestors of the agrarian Han people were originally nomads and followers of the wolf, and that Han people should replace the peasant mentality with the nomadic spirit (akin to that of the Mongols).<br /><br />Although the author describes himself as left-wing and pro-democracy, some critics denounced the book as 'fascist' or 'crypto-fascist' (some academics even compared the book to the works of Nihal Atsız), and some of the most nationalistic parts of the book were omitted from the English translation.<br /><br />I thought that this book might interest you, as you are of Turanist persuasion. The author's worldview is similar to yours ("I am still as barbarous and simple in my outlook on the world. Survive, take what you can, give nothing back. The law of the steppe is a harsh one. If two tribes are in an argument about a pasture, they fight. The loser leaves the pasture in shame. The winner stays in the pasture until a stronger tribe can drive them out of it"), although he chooses to internalize it through observing the way wolves behave.</p>
