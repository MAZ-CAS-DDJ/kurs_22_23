	No. I don't really use social media. However I do have a Fascist Liaison on facebook messenger exclusively for the purpose of planning meetings. No real political activity is disclosed due to the fact that Kikebook loves logging chats. We all just use our regular profiles since nobody posts anything.Â You seem to share a lot in common with me and my compatriots. I like the hard headed attitude. A lot of people on Iron March don't even share the same vision as people like us. We're militants, not Intellectuals. Let me know if you would be interested in joining the Liaison. From then on you can be briefed.
