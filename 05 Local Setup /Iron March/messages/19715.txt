	Welcome to the forums! They're not usually the most welcoming place, especially to women :( (the sad face means this state of affairs upsets meÂ because I greatly respect women). If you can ignore the initial hazing all new members go through however you'll find there are plenty of great people making a positive difference in the world. Good luck and feel free to PM me with any questions, comments, or concerns so I can directly bring them up to the administrators on your behalf. Don't worry - I'm not your typical guy. If anything I'd be the one in the kitchen ;).
