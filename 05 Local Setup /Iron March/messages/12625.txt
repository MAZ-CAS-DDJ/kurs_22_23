<p>TOR is my best friend right now. If I can't go the Rockwell Route and an attorney refuses to hear the case then I will be bringing it to every damned pundit, news outlet, and blog I can find. And then I run. Mike wants to put me in direct contact with Gary Lauck, who is afraid of speaking to me but has built a lot of trust with Mike. </p>
