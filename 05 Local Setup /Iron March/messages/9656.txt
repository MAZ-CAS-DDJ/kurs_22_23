<p>What English are you taking? I accidentally took a feminist English class once... Eeeuck.</p>
<p>I always liked the idea of living on a farm with a big bunch of kids. Take lots of pictures!</p>
<p>I haven't got much plans yet, I want to talk through some things with my dad. He hurt my mom, he did a lot of things that weren't right and I have to at least try to talk to him about it.</p>
<p>That song, how have I never heard it before? It's everything. </p>
