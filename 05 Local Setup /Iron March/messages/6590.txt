<p>Holy Rus is certainly something to aspire to for Russians and Ukrainians alike, however you should let go of the idea of a 'Third Rome' and the israelism you advocate in your General Statement of Belief. Messianism is alien to the Slavic racial soul and because of that, the different Slavic messianisms that unfortunately evolved in the last centuries have done nothing but damage to the nations that espoused them. IMHO, they are corruptions that can be attributed to the influence of an already degenerate West. Also, instead of referring to Moscow's political tradition, you should instead cherish the legacy of the magnificient medieval Russian states like Novgorod, Tver or Pskov. These states were much more Aryan in their nature and much more in line with the love for freedom that is inherent to all the Slav peoples. Regarding religion, I view any kind of dogmatism as harmful to faith and spirituality. The teachings are helpful to get a grasp of what is beyond the physical cosmos, but once you are conscious of the existence of God, your soul will find the right way automatically. First and foremost, the way to God is empathy, which is also the core of Aryanism. This explains why I reject WN/WS. These ideological abominations tell you to live only for the good of those most similar to you while turning a blind eye to the suffering of everyone else. By this logic, the nation is not a sacred, spiritual unity, but becomes an extension of the ego (and the ego is in fact Satan). Of course, this is incompatible with Aryan thought and incompatible with the Slavic racial soul. Universal compassion and a strong sense of justice is what made the Slav peoples great back in the days. To let Bright Rus shine again, we need to brush off all the garbage that has been burdening our souls for centuries now.</p>

<p>Thank you Svitanok for your reply; it really does make me think, as the Old Ways of Holy Rus and Pravoslaviye were maintained quite well before Moscow's rise to total power as the city of the Czars, and yes the freedom loving traditions of Novogorod, Tver, and Pskov as your examples are what I had forgotten in my enthusiasm, looking for resistance to the Reign of Antichrist when it began in Czarist Russia, the reign of Antichrist that is. And I now recall the early Cossacks and the Old Believers too, the resisters to the spirit of Nikonianism that resulted in Sergianism, the prostitution of the Moscow Patriarchate to serve the Devil's interests, much like the Patriarchate of Old Rome. 'Third Rome'.... It is an illusion, causing the murder of the very Saints I am united to, the many millions of Old Believer martyrs since the 1600's and many millions of others besides from all over. Czar Peter and Ivan Grozny's  heirs are still with us, Lenin, Stalin, and now Putin, well past 1917. Oprichnina, Okhrana, Cheka, NKVD, KGB, FSB, still the same 'Gosudarst' mentality. I had hoped that the worse aspects would change because I wished it to be so, as I said, so I could think of an Earthly center of resistance to the power of world zionism/communism.</p>

<p>As to WS/WN and my previous spirituality, I was raised a Racist and a Roman Catholic. I'm 45 years old and the habits and thought patterns of a lifetime are hard to break. That Western degeneration you speak of I lay at with the Vatican, Rome is a bottomless well of poison, I spent decades fighting for her interests and I lost Christ in the meantime. The drive to conquer others and compel good behavior from them, a satanic 'prelest'. But Codreanu and Orthodoxy have started to change all that within me, and more importantly as you say the conciousness of the existence of God. Empathy, Compassion, the strong sense of Justice, Aryanism, real Aryanism. My 'Israelism' as you put it, is a remnant of my 'Christian Identity' period, a personal belief in the identity of the early Israelites and descendants of Shem with the original Aryans, the 10 lost tribes of Israel becoming the Slavic nations by admixture with related Scythian peoples. It has little effect on my worldview, except that I view the Jews of today as a corruption of Aryan mankind, something that happened gradually until the modern people called the Jews arose after roughly 70 AD. I disagree slightly with the folks of 'aryanism.net' concerning a few things regarding Jews, YVWH, the Old Testement, Gnosticism and Christianity, etc...But not so much really. I find their position philosophically overall the best and most compelling information i've read in a while.</p>

<p>I don't know what my future is here on this forum, but Svitanok I thank you, and spiritually I am with you and with Ukraine, God bless you and Ukraine.</p>
