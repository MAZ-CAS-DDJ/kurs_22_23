<p>Yes, I am in America currently. In North Carolina, to be exact.</p>
<p>Most people will think of the racialist ethnically confused Americans likely because many on the Internet are American. And Americans, no matter whether they are far left or far right, are essentially brainwashed by the same institutions of thinking.</p>
<p>I do see it being a problem sometimes. It is so alien to some people (interestingly, all of these people have been Americans), that they think I must be joking or disingenuous.</p>
<p>I am not sure what I would call myself though. But I was inspired by the early works of Strasser, in some ways.</p>
<p>It is good you asked though, as I was considering posting in the thread about National Socialism, but I would probably be criticized by the Americans, who think National Socialism is entirely about "gassing kikes." As if anti semitism was apart of National Socialism when it first rose in popularity (though it was not)-- before betrayed by GÃ¶bbels.</p>
<p>What does a Prussia Socialist or Meritocrat mean to you?</p>
