<p>Bremerton is in Washington. Ah, I'm on a carrier, but I'm on a team right now. Our ship is in drydock and I'm sandblasting/powdercoating stuff, I get to work with a lot of sub guys, most seem to be SECF. My 2 chiefs in boot camp were actually sub ET's. These PM's seem to pile up quick and skype's chat function is pretty alright. Feel free to ask me anything though (even if I'm not on a sub).</p>
