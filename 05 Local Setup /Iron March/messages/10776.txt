<p>Thank you! We will get married, in a year or two. Once I get out of the legal trouble I'm in right now (charged with a hate crime, robbery, 2nd degree assault and battery, some other stuff) and save some money we will live together full time. Under house arrest right now so there's not much I can do. </p>

<p>We're super excited about kids, we have names picked out already. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> You're a dad right? Any advice you can give?</p>
