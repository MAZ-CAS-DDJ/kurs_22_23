<p>It's a very long story, but mostly it just made me realize how utterly disconnected the American bourgeoisie is from any of our ongoing wars, when in decades past, you were either for or against it (<em>usually for it, as you go further back into American history</em>). I just became completely burnt out with the things most Americans value, both on the Left and Right. Materialism, petty political issues, etc. when there were far more pressing, existential threats to everything that's good in life.</p>
<p>There were a lot of other factors as well, such as personal upheaval for me in 2011, which is where I had a very cruel wakeup to the fact that not only are we not all equal, but the fact that we can't merely vote away degeneracy... We have to cultivate an ethos of violence to form a perimeter against it.</p>
<p>That, and reading the book <em>"The Way of Men"</em> by Jack Donovan was what finally put into words what I had been feeling during that time, yet had no idea how to describe or articulate it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Way-of-Men-ebook/dp/B007O0Y1ZE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368382807&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+way+of+men" rel="external nofollow">I highly, HIGHLY recommend you read it if you haven't already. </a></p>
