	Sorry for the slow replies, I've been away (so no PC access) for work. I'd argue that Lenin's socialism wasn't true socialism as the USSR was inherently materialist, but Germany and Italy worked fairly well.

	Also, with TRS, even the supposedly "based" Aussies are completely full of shit, and their "principles" are nothing more than vehicle to countersignal the left. I'd avoid the platform all together. And considering the right these days is essentially about personal liberty and freedom to sell dildos, I'd ditch the label if I were you.
