<p>Ok, I'll write the introduction to the series, with it, the last sentence in the text can be erased then.</p>
<p>For this first part, since it's person-centric, the poster you plan to make could contain image of Dimitrije LjotiÄ‡ (which there aren't many), the alrgest one you can find is this one:<br /><a href="http://www.pogledi.rs/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ljotic.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://www.pogledi.rs/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ljotic.jpg</a><br /><br />There are other images who are in smaller format, but people often zoom them and put on some effects and filters and they look ok. I remember seeing somewhere his photo from first world war, will try to find it.<br /><br />You can also use image of othrodox cross since he was known as "Politician with a cross". If you're going to implement colors of the flag you can use the flag of Serbian Volunteer Corps, basically Serbian flag with SDK emblem (<a href="http://www.srb-akcija.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dobrovoljacki-krst.png" rel="external nofollow">http://www.srb-akcija.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dobrovoljacki-krst.png</a>) or colors of Yugoslav flag, but I think that would be appropriate in later chapters dealing with Yugoslav period specifically. Or simply colors without any fency embelms since that is more simple. <br /><br />If you're satisfied with the text and it's a NOOSE material, I'm interested in becoming part of the staff, mainly as correspondent from Serbia and writing articles featuring some elements of Serbian nationalists and fascist events, figures, works etc.</p>
