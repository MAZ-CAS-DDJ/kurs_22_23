<br><br>Latvia:<p>I feel sick hearing about what the evil kikes have done to these people. Riga ia a beautiful city though some parts are still riddles with bullet holes - swastikas are everywhere and sold in all the shops, bought myself a nice silver swastika ring and pendant. Tomorrow I will attend legionaires march and piss off the kikes. Going to be a complete shoah because the governement will be there for the first time in years.</p>
