			Just get good leaders and let dynasties form. If infighting happens it is the business of the warrior elite caste, so long as they remember their position and duty as that caste.

	A dynasty is a rather Asian system and is a bit foreign for a western country. Dynasty is more of like a divine empire of which the gods support the existence of until it seems that the gods don't care for it anymore. It's called the dynasty cycle. In that case the leader would be more like an emperor or monarch like autocratic leader. Monarchy was obviously based more on the notion that great leaders are born, and that it is in genetic code to have good leadership skills. Also corruption was not watched in monarchies like let's say a more authentic scenario of a Hitler/Mussolini like dictatorship (autocracy) where corruption is often more subverted. Monarchy does better than democracy, but still doesn't have much regard on the matter. I think leadership should be more formal than inherently spiritually based like let's say Hirohito was in Japan.
