<p>Esotric Hitlerist?</p>

<p>I just believe Adolf Hitler was right, and has been proven right by history. I think Mosley was more of a philosopher than an actual Leader, which is why I respect a lot of his views but think he didn't give the racial or Jewish Question the severity that it required.</p>
