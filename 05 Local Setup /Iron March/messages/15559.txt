	Other Poles also have this sentiment. When Pope Francis came to Poland for World Youth Day, many Poles were confused by his Pro-Immigration speech. A lot of them just flat out rejected what he said. Poland is the most Catholic country in Europe, and day by day, more Poles are becoming suspicious of the new Church.

	And that Jobbik rally looks sweet! (Nice ONR armband too haha). I usually never go to political marches or rallies, I would never want to be photographed or anything at something like that. I am too paranoid that I could be identified.

	Also, Islam will never be a useful ally. It is useless to support any type of Islamic movement, doesn't matter how Right-Wing it is. These people will always have a violent mentality. Just look at neighboring Christian countries like Armenia or Georgia. Russia has problems with Chechnya and Dagestan, China with Tibet, Serbia with Kosovo, and the list continues. We were not meant to live together. I will always hate both Islam and Judaism - I don't support Israel or Palestine. Both can get fucked.
