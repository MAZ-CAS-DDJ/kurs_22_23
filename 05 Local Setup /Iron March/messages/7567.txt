<p>Couldn't have said it better myself, people had it too easy here and you can live comfortably without ever lifting a finger for yourself or your nation. The only allegiance we have now are to our brothers and our principles, having allegiance even to our nations in their current state is a huge fallacy. The Order's fraternity style of brotherhood is exactly what's needed, more close knit active groups who take oaths, not large membership groups. This is pretty similar to what myself and my mates back home have going on.</p>
