<p>I'm going to the beach in Delaware! I love it up there, they have these old towers to climb that were used for Uboat spotting during the war, and all the old coastal guns. I have always liked climbing around old military stuff, sometimes I hang out around Ft McHenry in Baltimore that was used to repel the Brits in 1814.</p>

<p>It must be nice to agree so much with your father. I suppose I have a similar view, since I don't care much about America except wanting it to balkanize. Idk if that will happen in our lifetimes, but its inevitable anyway.</p>

<p>My favorite girls' names are Sofia, Maria, Eloise, and Anastasia. My boys will either be named after Roman emperors (Augustus, Julius, Tiberius, Romulus etc) or fascist leaders (Benito, Leon, Cornelius, etc) or a mix.</p>
