			Yeah but if you look up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Bratislava" rel="external nofollow">demographic changes of Bratislava</a> f.ex. you can see how Czechoslovakia turned a mostly German and Hungarian city into a Slovakian one in just a few years, even if before it was one of our most important cities in which a lot of our kings were crowned in the past. Nitra would have been a more Slovakian capital imho, even a more historical one because of its name. Also the ethnic maps of Czechoslovakia clearly shows that they didn't really give a shit about Germans and Hungarians when they created it.

	About Bratislava: It was ethnical cleansing of already cleaned area. Before Bratislava it was Prešporok/Poszony(sorry if it is written baddly)/Pressburg and before P./P./P. it was Preslava-Slavic land. When will Serbians get Kosovo back, even after 1000 years, i'm sure they will try to clean it like šiptars did before them.
</p>

<p>
	About Nitra: You are right, it is better positioned and have to do more with Slovak history
</p>

<p>
	Well, they didn't gave shit about anyone, just made the borders look good for them.

			Make a topic on the life in the Slovakian state for a start in which you can write about all these things you mentioned here and also the cult of Hlinka and post it in ex-Chechoslovakia, then you can make another topic which focuses on the person of Hlinka, his views on politics, religion with some quotes from him and post it in the Famous persons category.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you want I can check your writing before you post it (don't worry I won't do Hungarian pranks :D).

	That would be cool, what do you mean by Hungarian pranks? Putting paprika in every sentence? :D

	Clerical fascism:
</p>

<p>
	I don't know official definition of CF, but i can tell you how i see it. I see CF as type of fascism where God is above all. Most aurotity have priests and only highly religious person can get important job. People like that always think about what would God say about their actions, so they are like guided by God in some way. Society is build on rules and morals borrowed from some religion (ussualy christianity). Like ten Gods laws. Priests would be respected and trusted like it was in history(they were also very studious). Atheists wouldn't get a wife or job(ar least non dirty one[i mean jobs like canalisation digger]). Including death cult it would be just great. Worshiping dead saints and national heroes together with God himself, just imangine it. I think that i red somewhere on IM that only real clerical fascists were Tiso, Pinochet and Franco. I do not know about Pinochet and his religion view, but Franco gave some power to Vatican and priests as far as i know. Hope i described it well, if not ask for that i forgot
