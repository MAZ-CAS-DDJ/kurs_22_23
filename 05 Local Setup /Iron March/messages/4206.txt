<p>We get to know each other mainly through skype, which is immensely fun. Our prank calls are legendary, though unfortunately we've had to remove them from our official archive; <a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/IronSkype/" rel="external nofollow">http://www.mixcloud.com/IronSkype/</a> a lot of the recordings are still excellent. if you were to add me on skype I would put you in the group convos</p>
<p>As for questions about Spengler, you will have to be more specific, I can't remember what I wrote.</p>
