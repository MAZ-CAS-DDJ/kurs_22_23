	Very good! I wouldn't thought that this is so serious, but you will need trained men for the time we take back our territories from the artificial state of "Ukraine" (RUSSIA). :D

			But there is also a mix of garbage on this forum. Self-proclaimed "National Socialists" who are degenerates baring a false label. There are a lot of drug addicts, non-whites, apostates, and faggots on this forum, so its good to find true friends in the midst of all the bullshit.

	Have no fear, Slavros will purge them in time. There is always a Great Purge, I think maybe in every year or so, when the unused and degenerate profiles will be deleted.

<p>
	Good question... First I have to finish some projects and work to get money, than I have to start the research on my family to know where to go when I will be in Poland.

	I have tons of good ideas, I will share most of them on IronMarch, but first I have to nicely word them and so on, since my "everyday English" is a bit remiss, as you may noticed. :D
