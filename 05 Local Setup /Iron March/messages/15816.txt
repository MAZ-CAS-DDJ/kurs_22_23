			God is by nature good. He is perfectly good. He created man in His own image. So in the beginning, man was originally perfectly good. But in the garden of Eden, man exercised his free will and disobeyed God which made his nature to become imperfect and evil.<br /><br />
			Now we have a Good God and a bad men. God is the ruler of the entire world, he demands perfection because he himself is perfection. He cannot accept us, since we are imperfect. No matter how many good things a man does, he is still evil in the sight of the all perfect God. God has to bring perfect justice against evil.<br /><br />
			But God is also merciful and full of Love.<br /><br />
			So to fix that, God came into the Earth as a perfect man (<strong>Jesus Christ</strong>) and instead of punishing mankind, he punished himself, because <em><strong>He loved us that much and more</strong></em>.  So now God you see: God can Love us by giving himself as the way to perfect goodness and bring justice against evil by punishing himself for man's evil.

	That makes perfect sense, thanks for explaining. I will order a bible as soon as I get my next pay check. Can you send me a link to what bible I should get? I don't want to buy one from someone who just wants to make money, I want to buy one from a true Christian. I will begin praying from today and forward. How often should I go to church? There is one right down the road from where I live.

	We had a class back when I was still in school called "Christianity", the name is misleading, because they also taught us about other religions. But one thing I remember from that class was that there are more then one type of Christianity, or am I wrong is saying that? Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox right? Which one is the true one? Or should I say, which one should I follow?

	I also have another question. I am a vary dedicated National Socialist. What do you think gods opinion is about NS?
