As many of the ideals that make military service attractive are shared with nationalism. Though of course this has to be covert. More suggestion of ideals without any labels, then naming it later.</p>

<p>Whats do you think of the American Futurist workshop thread?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I think it makes some pretty excellent points and case, though i'm not a fan of  Blood and Irons secessionism.</p>
<p>The Abolishment of the (current)state and destruction of artificial placeholders of culture (entertainment industry) to make way for organic culture that must first manifest itself in tribalism an localism (clean slate clean start).</p>

<p>Seem sensible to the cause of real Nationalism, it essentially dispenses with idea of working within the system to change it, which to be honest may not even be possible at this point</p>
