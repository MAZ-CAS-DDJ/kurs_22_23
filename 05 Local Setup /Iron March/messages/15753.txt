	I saw you mention Ryan Fleming in a post, I quoted it. My name Is Kent McLellan, former leader of MD USA current Divison leader of Florida United, just resigned my postion as MD USA..Saw you say Fleming was unaffiliated with you all over a incident so it concerned me when just yesterday I get this list of names and addresses as "Intel" and the guy who apparently created the said list was named Ryan Fleming, and the list came off a bit fed like with the content it contained.

	So upon seeing that post, it sparked more concerns about this "Ryan Fleming" character. If he's just a psych case, that's fine I can deal with that. But if he's currently incarcerated or other suspicious circumstances too him, I would like to know to at least tell my guys to cut contact with him.

	I'm sorry for the shock of the message I really should've introduced myself or something along those lines.
