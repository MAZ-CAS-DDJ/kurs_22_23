<p>Good talk yesterday mate. One issue however, is that me and a couple of other NA guys <em>were </em>using CryptoCat not long back, and found it unreliable - specifically, sometimes messages we'd send would simply not be received by the person at the other end. With that in mind we started using SubRosa instead, which so far seems to be a step up in the reliability department. So basically, I'd like your opinion on our activists using SubRosa as an alternative to CryptoCat. Thanks.</p>
