<p>Hi Mierce,</p>
<p>I am curious. Why do you associate yourself with a mode of thinking that is ultimately dead set against what you represent, which is racial diversity and harmony?</p>
<p>You are smart enough to understand that 99% of the people on Iron March, as well as their real life comrades, will never accept your ideas. They don't care about historical facts, evidence, or any sort of contemplation of alternative ideas. They just chant "niggers niggers niggers suck" and work up a frenzy that way.</p>
<p>Why bother? Your political interests do not lay in the Fascist movement. There will be nothing waiting for people of color besides bloodshed and oppression. </p>
<p>I'm just curious about your opinion. Take care.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
