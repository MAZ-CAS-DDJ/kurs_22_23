<p>sorry for my belated response on this. really, thanks for these sources.</p>

<p>1.The geoolitical strategy of dividing Sunni and Shia makes sense - you have this Moscow-Tehran-Damascus holdout, that not only</p>
<p>The position fo Syria right now is that if any nationalist group shows they are worth their salt by supporting syria in the institutions or staging protests, then they are invited. In fact, as you may well know Nick returned from Syria for the second time today. He claims to have written at least in part the appeal to the MP's from the Syrian government. nationalists could well do with the resources. Nick doesn't appear that often on RT though, maybe the time is not right yet?</p>

<p>The Shia states seem to be 100% zogged and anti russian - there are always diplomatic problems (Moscow cut ties with Quatar or Aden if I remember over one such incident. )</p>
<p> </p>
<p>against it - I am pretty sure the bolshevisation doesn't stop on the religious divide and lots of sunni have it as well. The Arab spring being launced originally in Iran in the failed rose revolution - i think it was supposed to play like this thing</p>

<p>I have noticed Galloway who was singing the rebal praises only two years ago is now solidly behind syria. Weird.</p>
