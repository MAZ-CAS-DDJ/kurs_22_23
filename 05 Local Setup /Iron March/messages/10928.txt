<p>I'm just wondering if they would fire us for writing papers in <strong>support</strong> of Fascism. That is something I am going to have to ask my academic adviser/professor about. Or more likely, what would happen is that they(the current academic establishment) would make up some bullshit reason to fire you. Also, in my opinion I don't think that in a Fascist society you would be allowed to voice descent. For example, I wouldn't want there to be a Marxist professor because he may end up leading some students away from Fascism and to Marxism. Thus, creating the same problems we have today. Of course, that is just my opinion.  </p>
