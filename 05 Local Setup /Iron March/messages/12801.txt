	Glad to see there's other Fascists in Florida, I'm the current leader of the Atomwaffen Division. We are a National Socialist organisation with dozens of guys in the U.S, and many chapters around the states. Our biggest chapter is in Florida, we meet up frequently and we do a lot of activism. We don't have anyone in Miami, but if you're interested in joining, we can have a screening whenever its the most available to you. Welcome to Iron March by the way!Â <img alt=":handy:" data-emoticon="" src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/handy.png" title=":handy:" /></p>
