	I'm not a pagan in a religious sense, that means I don't believe in existence of pagan gods and the rest of the mythology.

	However, I respect paganism as our original European culture and I admire the fact that most pagan societies glorified everything active, strong and daring, instead of everything passive, weak and humble like Christianity does.

	If you look at the list of Christian saints, you'll realise that most of them were mentally sick people who enjoyed pain and self deprivation and eventually died in some horrible way - hardly an example worth following.

	To me, Christianity is in its essence a predecessor of socialism/communism, an ideology for incompetent people who need some higher authority to tell them what to think and what to do because they don't want to have any personal responsibility for their life.

	When it comes to Atheism, I strongly recommend YouTube channel of Aronra, he mainly talks about creationism but has some great videos about Jesus (who, according to him, maybe never existed as a single person who could be reliably identified in time and space). I once spoke to him when he was in Czech Republic.
