			I've been intensely researching <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> since my previous reply. Immediately, I was particularly fascinated with, and inspired by, the write ups and videos of the Liverpool confrontation, and the recent demo at Berwick (before seeing your reply on here). I also found the doctrinal and ideological work on <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>'s website, and a <em>Studio 204 </em>interview with Ben Raymond on YouTube, extremely informative and helpful in gaining a more representative understanding of <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>'s ideology and activities.

	I always find Ben very interesting to listen to, and I know several people in the group who joined primarily on the basis of interviews with him, or documents/propaganda authored by him. You might've seen it already, but I'd recommend the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjVE4J4mBRA" rel="external nofollow">short interview</a> he did with the BBC as part of their 'Radicals' series. Obviously it doesn't offer much in the way of an ideological exploration, but it's interesting to see how he dealt with the different line of questioning from a mainstream journalist who has nothing in common with <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> ideologically.

			This is exactly the kind of deeper ideological direction and communal engagement that I have been seeking. The Leftist monopoly regarding support of poor communities is broad, but extremely shallow - they will gladly sacrifice the safety and wellbeing of the white working class (and those of the middle class who don't conform with their oh-so-enlightened principles), in order to further the narrow and nationally fracturing interests of their favourite pet minority group of the moment.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once the virtue signalling and, more crucially, damage to the cohesion and identity of the nation has been done, Leftists are all too willing to discard these very same minorities and brand them as part of the "oppressors". This enables them to move on to another even more niche group, and cause further damage to our society (take the recent treatment of white, gay males by significant sections of the left, and the increasing focus on "transgenderism" or a whatever the newest term is - hilarious and incredibly ironic in equal measure). (Also, I'm using Left here in the broad sense to denote cultural Marxism, faux-liberals, etc, for ease and simplicity).

<p>
	Indeed, identity politics looms large on the Left these days. In my view this continual splintering is the natural destination of the civil rights/'equality' struggle, and decades of Liberal and Left-leaning whites allying with and fighting the corner of more and more obscure minority groups against an increasingly abstract sense of oppression, in order to assuage their own bottomless sense of guilt. And as you say, for those left behind by this race to the bottom it's not simply a matter of no longer being flavour of the month, as the oppressed of yesterday quickly become the oppressors of today. As French journalist Jacques Mallet du Pan once remarked, "the Revolution devours its children".
</p>

<p>
	To continue with the French flavour, Voltaire once said that "if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him", and so it has proven for the modern Left in terms of the many spectres with which they now do battle on other people's behalf. In order to justify their continued existence (and in UAF's case, government funding) in the absence of a large-scale Fascist street movement movement to oppose, Anti-Fascist groups write off ever broader sections of mainstream public opinion as being racist or xenophobic, and add yet more terms to the list of things they can posture online about 'smashing' (homophobia, Islamophobia, transphobia etc). Likewise, 'oppression' now takes so many forms that as a straight white man, chances are you're inadvertently guilty of some form of it at any given moment of your existence (I'm manspreading as I write this, and were you a woman I'd definitely be mansplaining here too).
</p>

<p>
	In a sort of "grass is always greener" sense, there seems to be an assumption among some on our side that the Left is somehow a united monolith, but having once walked in those apparently lush green pastures myself I know it to not be the case. In my view the fault-lines in the Left are deeper and more numerous than they've ever been, and their famous 'solidarity' frequently dissolves into petty, identity-based squabbling and 'my oppression is bigger than yours'. One of the key realisations that drove me away from the particular corner of the Left that I'd spent years prior to that cultivating my interest in was that having met and associated with people in the scene over a period of time, it became apparent that I simply felt no kinship of any form with them. It wasn't the case that I didn't get on with them personally, it was simply that seeing who they were, what they did, and what they hoped to be left me with no desire to be any part of it.

			<font face="gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px;">Thank you, and I 100% agree. I stand up and argue the case for my views, both in person and online, at all opportunities (hence my frequent conflict with Leftist organisations and individuals). But I'm not a larper, and know this alone is not enough to affect significant change. I've not been engaged in Leftist activism for roughly 7 months, due to conflicts, exclusions, and general personal ambivalence (also finishing off my Masters degree, moving location, getting a job etc). Although I've a long way to go before being accepted a member of <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr>, my ideological fervour, personal determination, and several years of practical experience will be greatly useful.</span></font>

			<font face="gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px;">I definitely have concerns about privacy, but this is something I must take responsibility for myself. My current living space is highly compromised, but it will not affect my activity. I'm just north of London, so think that the London branch would be most suitable for me. Ben Raymond, in the interview noted above, stated that the average age of members is "well under 20" - I'm assuming that being 22 doesn't rule me out or anything?</span></font>
		</p>

		<p>
			<font face="gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px;">Should I contact <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> through the email on their website to inquire about involvement? I understand there will be several tests to prove both my practical worth and commitment to the cause. I'm happy to answer questions about my previous activism, political engagement, or current personal arrangements on here otherwise.</span></font>

	On the contrary, privacy concerns are considered a matter for all of us and we do our best to safeguard the privacy of all those involved with the group, both in terms of how internal communications are structured and the education of those members that are perhaps less aware of security concerns, but nonetheless open to fallout in their personal lives as a result of a security breach.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not sure 'well under 20' is accurate as an average age, and it's certainly higher than that among the leadership, but the general range the group is looking for is 18-30, so you're absolutely fine on that front.
</p>

<p>
	If you're only just outside London and think London would be best for you in terms of travel then you can email the London group directly, or if you're unsure you can send your application through the main e-mail and it will be forwarded to a regional group accordingly, but obviously if you've decided the London group would be best then this will just add another stage to the process of the email getting passed to the right people. Both emails are on the <a href="https://nationalactionlondon.wordpress.com/about/" rel="external nofollow">London contact page</a><span> </span>, so you can take your pick. It isn't mentioned on the London page, but it's worth sticking to the application structure from the <a href="http://national-action.info/join/" rel="external nofollow">Join page on the main site</a> when applying, and of course you can mention you've spoken to me on here.
</p>

<p>
	In terms of tests, the way it usually works isn't exactly the Odyssey or anything. As far as practical worth and commitment go, who possesses it and who doesn't tends to become apparent over time, so it's better to think of the initial real-world meeting as a case of breaking the ice and getting to know each other. Depending on the group's social calendar your initial meet-up could be either a one-to-one meeting with an organiser, or meeting more of the group as part of a London-based activity.
</p>

<p>
	As far as offering further details about yourself, save that for if and when it becomes necessary during the application process. If you've got anything else you want to ask then of course I'll be here, but otherwise hope to see you on the other side.
</p>
