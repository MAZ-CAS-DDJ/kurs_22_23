<p>My take on Jewishness is closer to H.K.Guenther's defination in that Jews are not a race as such but an amalgam defined under religion and culture, in which case I myself have Jewish ancestry. I am aware of Revisionist Maximalism, was it Abimeir? I am also firmly of the opinion that Himmler and co were Zionists. Are you familiar with National-Futurism?</p>
