<p>Another thing. I'm thinking about getting a tattoo on my left arm: "memento audere semper" with this roman-style font: <a href="http://www.asromaultras.org/memento01_jpg.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://www.asromaultras.org/memento01_jpg.jpg</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It would be on the inner side, so I could see it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The slogan means "remember to dare always"</span> in Latin, <span>"remember to be always daring"</span>. It was coined by Gabriele D'Annunzio and was used by Fascists en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decima_Flottiglia_MAS</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To me it personifies my fascist life and my lifestyle in general. I like to remember it whenever I face difficult situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What do you think about it? Be honest.</p>
