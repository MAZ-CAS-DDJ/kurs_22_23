	Thanks for the quick response! I see your point now.
</p>

<p>
	So the problem with a group like ISIS is that they themselves don't understand Islam's inner essence, but only the outer substance that has been added to it over 1400 years. And furthermore, they also want to destroy much of that outer substance, which would ultimately just create a black hole because there'd be almost nothing left of Islam. Thus, the end result (the inevitable conclusion) of a group acting like ISIS won't be the final unification of Islam, but rather it will be the Protestantization of the religion into tens of thousands of different denominations. In other words: ISIS won't end up unifying Islam or returning the Muslim world to its roots (even though that's what they want), because they themselves don't have the spiritual strength to do so. But instead, they are just breaking Islam up and will eventually cause its demise just like what the Protestants did with Christianity. That's what you mean, right?
</p>

<p>
	And this line really stood out to me:

<p>
	Again, this just keeps reminding me of the Protestants. How did you end up with 40000 different Protestant denominations? I suppose that is what happened: in their efforts for reformation, the Protestants just saw the dividing substance, but not the uniting essence. Even though they wanted purity and reformation, and they said they were returning Christianity to its true roots, in reality they themselves simply didn't have the spiritual strength to carry out such a monumental task, and so Protestantism just ended up serving whatever local and personal interests the people within the various groups had.
</p>

<p>
	This also reminds me of a saying from the Buddha:
</p>

<p>
	"In a world become blind,<br />
	I beat the drum of the Deathless."
</p>

<p>
	Isn't he basically talking about Involution here? He's essentially saying he's returning to the Truth, which is also what the Protestants claimed, but the difference here is that the Buddha actually did have the spiritual strength to carry out such a task, and that's why he was successful. Would you say that's a fair example? It's also interesting that the Buddha did both of the two things that you mentioned: he did it all by bettering himself, and he also didn't care if others followed him or not.

	But then, this raises another question in my mind: what about someone like Hitler, who eventually did force people to follow him? I mean, Hitler certainly qualified for your 1st requirement (bettering himself); however, he certainly didn't qualify for your 2nd one (at least when it came to the masses). And I know the whole thing about having a temporary period of forcing others to listen to you until the Organic State is created, but this is now more from a political perspective than a religious one. I mean, remember Ustryalov's "violence can't save a dying idea blah blah". Is that what you mean here? Or is that a whole different issue?
</p>

<p>
	Also, obviously in a fascist state there are always going to be lots of things you would force people to do or not do, and that means you <em>would</em> have to force others to follow you. I guess this is my problem with what you're saying here: what you're saying is a bit too close to the whole egalitarian conception of tolerance and humanism and equality and so on. It's not the same, but I could see it as a line of reasoning that could easily go down a really dangerous path. "God has no religion" sounds just a bit too much like a theological version of "we all bleed red." Now, I remember we talked about something similar to this in my introduction thread, where you said that a Sufi mystic and a Christian ascetic can know and respect each other, but still they'd be against equality and humanism. But I never understood your actual reasoning behind that. How do you separate this from typical humanistic egalitarianism?

	Ultimately, I agree with you that God is above all else, and that this overriding Truth is above all else (including the various shapes that the Truth takes throughout the world). Still, my attitude is one of "we have to do what must be done." Do you see what I mean? "We have to do what must be done" is how I interpret all of this, which basically means that I am still happy about the downfall of Islam. I can't not be.
</p>

<p>
	I haven't read that Evola book yet, but I'll try to find it because it looks very good from the information I've just gathered about it, and also I'll listen to that Sufi audio later too. Mysticism is always nice. :)

<p>
	Yazdanism
</p>

<p>
	Huh, sorry about that. I kinda… neglected it. The thing is, I realized that if I do a write-up on Yazdanism, I can't half-ass it. I can't just throw some random garbage in there and leave it at that, because that would be too disrespectful to my own faith, and it would also look stupid to the forum. But the problem is, if I do post a huge write-up (like one of Slavros' big threads), then that would almost make me sound like I'm some sort of a "regular contributor" to Iron March. Does discussion of Yazdanism belong on Iron March, a European forum? I say, not really. Mind you, I don't belong here either, and I only created this account to see if I could find other Kurdish fascists. So that's why I was conflicted, and I ended up just neglecting it.
</p>

<p>
	But of course, I can prepare a write-up for you if you care about it. I can send it to you in a PM, and I'd be fine with that. :D
