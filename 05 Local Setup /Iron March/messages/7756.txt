<p>Title: We are that team</p>
<p>Whole life I'm in training</p>
<p>to beat an obstacle</p>
<p>to forget about trouble in my soul</p>
<p>So I struggled</p>
<p>in the worst weather</p>
<p>walking on thorns</p>
<p>not on red carpet</p>
<p>And even when life wasn't sparkling</p>
<p>it made sense</p>
<p>I never fealt guilty</p>
<p>becuase of hundreds of sacrifices</p>
<p>Biting like a pitbull</p>
<p>when facing a crisis</p>
<p>I could lift 10 times</p>
<p>but I did it 150 times</p>
<p>I never experienced defeat</p>
<p>some say that it's bitter</p>
<p>some say that struggle is only foreplay for downfall</p>
<p>When it's hard they say enough</p>
<p>in fact that's a trap</p>
<p>but I have serum against it</p>
<p>it's named will</p>
<p>Sun which shines</p>
<p>as if saying "hold on"</p>
<p>wind music for my ears</p>
<p>rain rhytm which pours</p>
<p>On Belgrade asphalt</p>
<p>these legends are made</p>
<p>blossoming until they're forged in the best</p>
<p>through cracks in the concrete</p>
<p>In every neighbourhood of the city</p>
<p>they rose like stars</p>
<p>but they all remember where they come from</p>
<p>Chorus (2x):</p>
<p>Sun is shinning like gold</p>
<p>everyone attack with courage</p>
<p>remember that in Belgrade</p>
<p>today is the day for victory</p>
<p>We are that team</p>
<p>which understands each other in motion</p>
<p>following the codex</p>
<p>winning in one move</p>
<p>We are that team</p>
<p>with complete determination</p>
<p>agreement with one look</p>
<p>enough for decision</p>
<p>When emotions carry us</p>
<p>and when worries crush us</p>
<p>that's the character of this team</p>
<p>everyone knows us for it</p>
<p>Everyone remembers the champions</p>
<p>champions of million</p>
<p>who leave their heart</p>
<p>until they burn out in victory</p>
<p>Because that is how we grew up</p>
<p>Spartan education</p>
<p>we didn't have a childhood</p>
<p>to become the best</p>
<p>To become immortal</p>
<p>we became a team</p>
<p>we sacrificed ourselves</p>
<p>that is how we prepared</p>
<p>Let's raise our hands</p>
<p>because our nation is made for this</p>
<p>to support those</p>
<p>who shine for our colors</p>
<p>Because we came here</p>
<p>to fullfil the dreams</p>
<p>to light up the sea</p>
<p>and raise everyone on their feet</p>
<p>Our thought, our idea</p>
<p>let it shine like a flare</p>
<p>everyone together with us</p>
<p>because there's no going back from here</p>
