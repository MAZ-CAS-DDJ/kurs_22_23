	This is the providence of God. I am going to Mount Athos with my Father in the Spring. Glory be to God's providence, indeed, we shall go. We were planning on going for 4 days, probably to Simonopetras. We were going to reserve for April 21st, right after Bright Week. My Father is also essentially NS and has recently converted to Orthodoxy, Glory to Christ the High Priest.<br /><br />
	God defend you from your enemies invisible and invisible.
