	Hey man, I noticed on the forum your a Christian and ive been brought up in a Christian family and have been going to church regularly all my life. But I have a lot of questions whether Christianity is compatible with national socialism. Basically everyone in my life will tell me its not and hitler is burning in hell right now, so i dont think they are the right people to ask.

	Anyway, ill get to it. I get confused when Jesus says in the book of Matthew, when someone slaps you, you turn the other cheek for them to slap as well, all that love your enemies shit. So how did you find that its perfectly natural to be a Christian and a Nazi? What readings can you recommend?

	Cheers.
