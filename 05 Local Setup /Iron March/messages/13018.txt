	Thats exciting, I met my husband online and all went exactly how I thought it would go. I did not have any doubts either.

	I do grow my own food and own chickens but many of plants died in the drought and heat this year. In the previous years my plants did well. So thats removed some of my confidence.

	I buy my meat directly from farmers and am a big pork eater. Its a lot of work running a farm. My farmer gets people to work for her for free in exchange for food and accommodation.

	They are all white, often on tourist type visas or other visas so thats good. I like knowing my money is going towards my own kind.

	Yep having a big family toughened me up and helped me not become a raging liberal. I learned how to fight/stand up for myself by fighting my siblings! Hahaha  its good because you see the nature nurture in action when you have nine siblings, you get the smart/funny/sarcastic/dumb/athletic ones and so on, all to the same parents so you eventually realise everyones born with their own unique traits. Parents arent as uptight either and dont take them selves so seriously and generally enjoy life more with more children.

	My two children are great fun to parent. They fight with each other but also I see them even at age two, give up their only chocolate to their sibling out of love. My children age five and two always look out for each other. Very sweet.
