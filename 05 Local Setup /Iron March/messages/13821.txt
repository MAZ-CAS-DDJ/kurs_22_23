	I am also from Boston, and I know the individuals who have done the stickering, but I was not involved when they did it.  However, the admin noticed a discrepancy between your IP and where you say you are from. I'm sure it was just bad timing, as you said you were on a trip of some sort I believe. However, we need to know if you are trustworthy, seeing as the police and outsiders in general have become unnerved because of our presence and are actively trying to search for us, on top of the initial bad impression you made with your IP. Whatever means they go about doing that is irrelevant. Recently, someone who used to be a 'dedicated' member on this site turned against the site and attempted to doxx those who did the stickering. It turned out to be a false flag, but we cant have incidences like this again, I hope you understand. As for joining, you will need to be evaluated. its not like interrogation or intimidation, just want to see if you stand by your words.
