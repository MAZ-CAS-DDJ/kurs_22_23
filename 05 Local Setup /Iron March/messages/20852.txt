	Hello. I don't believe we've talked much, if at all. I've been a member since 2012 but haven't been as active in the movement as I'd like to be. Link me the Paypal. I just started a new job and may be able to help a little bit with funds. It won't be much because I just found a new place to live and a new job but it'll be something. I should be getting paid pretty soon.

	I'm interested in your situation in Venezuela. More info and pictures would be nice. Also wondering what the USD buying power is down there in Venezuela.
