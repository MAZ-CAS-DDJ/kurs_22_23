	I'm doing alright. I got a benign growth on my spine. It needs to be removed because it's causing some health issues. It's not genetic or anything. It's just one of those luck of the draw kind of shit. It's fucking huge though as far as growths go. It's considered giant sized(over 6 cm). So I need to get surgery to remove it. <br /><br />
	As for my family they're doing great. My son is big and strong. He's taking pain like a champ too. We were at an Easter celebration and some other kid stabbed him in the face with a pen and he didn't even cry. He still thinks violence is funny. He likes to hit people(luckily he hasn't hit other people's kids..yet lol). Baby #2 is doing awesome too. We find out the gender next month so I'm stoked about that. <br /><br />
	Overall things could be better, but they could also be a lot worse. How's Jew York these days? You still dating the Italian chick? <br />
