	Alright, will put a link up on the IM Twitter.
</p>

<p>
	BTW your guys on the SKYDAS twitter have been showing a lot of support for the American Vanguard group. Just a FIY, but they've been on IM and left (they even edited all their posts in their dedicated thread to be empty) because they want to pursue a "respectable" path (and thus can't be associated with IM) and professed such nonsense as "we'll do more service to National-Socialism by not calling it National-Socialism" and at the same time saying negative things about Hitler on pol, stealing and cucking propaganda from Atomwaffen division and actually actively trying to undermine them all the while being low energy "make america modest again" faggots.

<p>
	Their dedicated thread still has some stuff left in it in the form of quotes of their posts

	Do what you will, just figured you should be aware of this regardless of how you'll choose to deal with it.
