<p>Well that does sound like real autism as I know it, and yes I heard about the neanderthal DNA. Negroids and Australoids lack Neanderthal DNA - that is what makes them inferior. Ashkenazi Jews have more, which is why they have higher chances of autism. Also describes their neurotic behavior and why they're generally good with math. I theorize them being forced to be bankers in the middle ages bred in autistic traits.</p>
<p>Me? I have Borderline Personality Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD. (Yes, I am very fucked up) Basically my amygdala is hypersensitive - it is funny I have a lot of aspergers traits but in a sense I have the opposite of autism, the social part of my brain is just oversensitive so I have anxiety as a result. I also tend to "get" things better than other people, too, just got good instinct.</p>
<p>OCPD is what causes most of my aspergers-like traits, but it's all due to anxiety. I'd over-explain myself out of fear of people not getting me, it's all subconscious. I'm too neat and orderly, and a huge perfectionist in everything I do. I think the stereotypical "spergy" traits are just OCPD, and it's not real autism.</p>
<p>Also as a result of my strong id, I have emotional dysregulation. I can trigger manic episodes by thinking too much about something that pisses me off...in fact due to the OCPD, it's nearly impossible to stop thinking about something willingly. I was misdiagnosed Bipolar for a long time, probably because they don't suspect Borderline in men, as it is more common, as well as stereotyped, as a woman's disorder.</p>
