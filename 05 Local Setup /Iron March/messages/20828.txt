	The link you sent me literally also agrees with what I'm saying. Trans people do not "become" trans, because you are born trans. If someone is number 2 then they are not a real trans person. Trans was sacred and respected in ancient times and in highly advanced civilizations, such as ancient Egypt. It's the cosmology of the divine. Trans is a metaphysics of its own, we have and always will exist.

On its own, being transgender is not considered a medical condition. Many transgender people do not experience serious anxiety or stress associated with the difference between their gender identity and their gender of birth, and so may not have gender dysphoria." - </span><a href="http://www.transequality.org/issues/resources/frequently-asked-questions-about-transgender-people" rel="external nofollow">http://www.transequality.org/issues/resources/frequently-asked-questions-about-transgender-people</a>

	I don't care if you think the Third Sex is bad, degenerate or some illness. That's not why I msged you anyways, and I'm not going to tell you who it is.
