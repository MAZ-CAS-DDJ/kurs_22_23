<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I am a member of Nordisk Ungdom (NU). I still have contact with them, but i have not been all too active for a while. Nordisk Ungdom, if you don't know, is a non-parliamentary nationalist youth organisation. I am currently thinking of joining SvP. As for SMR and FNU i am skeptical towards both, but also sympathetic towards their intentions. Are you a member of any nationalist organisation or party? </p>
