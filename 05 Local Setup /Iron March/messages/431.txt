<p>Hey i've been kind of sitting on this for a while and wanted to apologize, been very busy. We're about to start another training rotation that will have me in the desert, and I haven't been able to come up with some answers that I am content with.  Is it possible just to do some editing on the parts in question?  If I don't do it tonight, it wont be done for three weeks, and I just don't think it'll be done tonight.</p>
