	Haha, we are the exact same in regards to that. I have a small library of just over 100 books now and I am constantly reading. I've got a lot to get through. Not sure about Barnes and Noble, since I'm not an Americlap. Varg's books are exclusive to Amazon probably, but the others shouldn't be so hard to find, as I've seen most of them around local bookstores.

	I haven't read the Necronomicon, I've just read a few of his short stories. That's one I need to get around to purchasing though.
