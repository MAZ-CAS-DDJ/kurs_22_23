<p>Well, it is good to see I haven't been forgotten. I have not had much time for internet forums, I have been pretty busy with work as well as finishing up school. Also admittedly, when I have been posting, I have been posting over at SP still. I find that the members there are more open to the revolutionary socialist doctrine that I espouse than members here are. I find myself ever more entrenched in fourth political theory, the best of the left and the new right. </p>
<p>I see you have had an ideology change? How would you describe Folkish nationalism? </p>
<p>I probably won't check this much, so if you are going to reply, I implore you to:</p>
