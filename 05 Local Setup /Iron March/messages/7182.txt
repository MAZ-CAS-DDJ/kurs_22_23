<p>"that's quite a shitty system you have there" Haha! This is my thoughts on quite a bit of America... It costs something like $10,000 USD each year of schooling, not including room and board. And that is the cheaper ones! I just got another job, this one working in a day care with little children.<br /><br />Oh man, you outdid me! I went to a bonfire down at the shore then went diving with some friends. It was nice. I have yet to really be drinking to the point of drunk... the locals are neglecting my education xD<br /><br />Hmm, mostly work I think. Maybe a driving trip with some firends. You? Ah, but I did travel a bit this spring, it was really good!</p>
