	Slovak state-&gt;Cult of Andrej Hlinka
</p>

<p>
	During existence of Slovak state Andrej Hlinka was called "Eternal leader" and he was something like dead celebrity. There were 50 000 people on his funereal and lot of them "didn't minded waiting 1-2 nights waiting till start and sleeping on benchces or grass". He would propably becomed first president of Slovak state if he didn't died some months before independed Slovakia apeared. There were still lot of articles about him in news and every year people were visiting his tomb and praying(that happens to this time, but there aren't as many people here and his tomb is without his body). In the ending days of war, Alexander Mach with help of some German soldiers relocated his body and then it just dissapeared(propably he did that because he didn't wanted it being mocked or destroyed by soviets). Rumors says that only three people(priests) know where it is and when one of them is going to die 2 remaining tells secret to another one. They always make oath where they promise that they will tell secret to public, only when Slovakia becomes Slovak and catholic again. Also he is called at least "Father of nation" in this decadent times.
