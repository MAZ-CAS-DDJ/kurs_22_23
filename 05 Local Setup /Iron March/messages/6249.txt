I've lived in a city all my life, and by being born right at the fall of the Soviet Union i was able to absorb and filter all the shit that this regime left for me my country.  Well I'll explain my going into the right-wing movement in more detail when we meet, and some of the things I got up to. I'm a bit untrustworthy of closed-circuit websites when it comes to personal information. </p>

<p>Vargsmal is a very interesting book, written by an even more interesting person. I have to admit i do like his musical work a lot as well.</p>

<p>And going to Hungary would be good, I'm all about networking with people, sounds like a great opportunity. I don't drink alcohol, but I suppose I'm not the only one in the movement. Do you think any people of "Jobbik" will take part in this?</p>

<p>And Monday sounds great for me. Where and when is good for you?</p>
