	Hey Hadit,
</p>

<p>
	This is Blackshirt 13 here. I was just wondering if you have ever read <em>Gabriele D'Annunzio Poet, Seducer, and Preacher of War </em>by Lucy Hughes-Hallet? Here is a link right here. <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/gabriele-dannunzio-lucy-hughes-hallett/1113855222?ean=9780307276551" rel="external nofollow">http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/gabriele-dannunzio-lucy-hughes-hallett/1113855222?ean=9780307276551</a> So, do you think it would be worth the read even though the author is obviously biased? She refers to Fascism as "thuggery". Let me know what you think and if this might be worth buying in the future. Please let me know if you get this.
