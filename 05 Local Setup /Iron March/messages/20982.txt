	I went to PI in August of 2005, just out of high school. I wanted to go infantry, but I scored well enough on the ASVAB to get into Intel, so my recruiter pushed me in that direction. He knew what I was looking for and told me to seek out Recon. He fed me this line saying "if you go intel/recon I'll probably never hear from you again." That was a load of bull and not as straight a path as he led me to believe, but after 2.5 years I found my way to MARSOC.

	You'll get some good training going infantry. Although it's more competitive among that group of Marines, if you can get into Recon (Basic Recon Course, Advanced Recon Course... which may have been replaced by the MARSOC pipeline) you'll be the elite among the elite.  Might be something to ask your recruiter about, if you're interested. In any case good luck at BC. As long as you do exactly what the DIs tell you and do it fast, you shouldn't have any trouble.

	What's your group and where are you at?
