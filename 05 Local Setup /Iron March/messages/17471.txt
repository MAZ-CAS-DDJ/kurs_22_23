	I've been watching this really autistic machinima series on youtube called Red vs Blue it uses Halo characters and they made a whole story I don't know how but they actually made me care about the characters . Also pretty good music made for the show in later seasons.

	I only have halo 1 for PC I don't even like video games mostly because when I try to play them I can never win and I hate wasting the time I could be listening to music or reading about ancient gods, but I like science fiction so I watch all the cutscenes from Halo on YouTube pretty good scifi story.
