<p>I didn't assume you guys were idiots but with how easy it is to start a forum now-a-days most people don't know the simple shit and you have to point it out and make sure they didn't skip the obvious. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyway, those ACP options can be added with php, which is what it seems like has to be done here. Control+F your php settings for ['allowavatar'] and look for the following line, and tell me what options and exceptions you have:</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
if($forum['allowavatars'] != 1)
	{
		$post['useravatar'] = "";
	}
</pre>
<div> </div>
<p> </p>
<div> </div>
<p> </p>
