			The Code of the Sith was created by David Gaider, who wrote the Korriban segment of the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Initially, Gaider had asked Lucasfilm whether the Sith had a written creed like the Jedi did. When he was told to write one specifically for the game, Gaider reversed the existing Jedi Code and complemented it with a Sith philosophy partly inspired by Mein Kampf, the infamous autobiographical manifesto written by the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.

			The Sith saw themselves as seekers, challengers of old and stagnant ways, in touch with the laws of nature and the universe. They saw the Jedi as denying their natures and afraid of the truth around them.

			he Sith did not believe that victory by any means was desirable, but believed that unless victory proved your superiority, it was an illusion and temporary. Though there might be different types of victories—peaceful victory, victory by sacrifice, even a truce—Sith dogma taught that unless the victory was achieved by demonstrating that one's power was superior, it was not true victory. The stronger a Sith became in the Force, the more power he could achieve, but he always had to fight for that power.
