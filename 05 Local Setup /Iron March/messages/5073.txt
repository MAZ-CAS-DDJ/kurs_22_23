<p>No need to apologize, that was very informative. Thoughi had known that the emperor was under a form a "Regency" i hadnt known that he had not held actual power.</p>

<p>But an arguement could be made that it was because of Japans rising imperialism and power that the west was held of from the east long enough for the rest of the asian countries to gain some sort of self preserverence. China may not be the best example but it is in part to japan that it exists as an independent power to this day.</p>

<p>I do agree, to some extent, that Japanese authoritarianism was a flawed system. I would like to point out, however, that they were taking steps to consolidate, State Religion for example, and, also a point you made, had they not engaged in a land war with china they might have pulled themselves up faster.</p>
