<p>Casa pound has religion and nationalism to drive people in the first place and further inspire new people.</p>

<p>Canadian nationalism, as it stands, isn't going to drive people to action. It doesn't have a whole lot of legitimacy in the first place because our country is so young and has essentially become a satellite state of the US. The differences between American and Canadian culture are very few. We have to face the fact that thanks to technology and a lack of civic virtue (how many people seriously know their neighbours) many Canadians today feel more emotional attachment to American sitcoms and celebrities than their own unique communities in Canada.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I think Canadian nationalism could be rescued and developed but I don't believe it would be the spark to ignite and inspire a revolutionary party.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The problem is without nationalism and/or religion I don't see what could be the inspiration for such a movement to materialize around.</p>
