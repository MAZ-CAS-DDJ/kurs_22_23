	Oh yeah that sounds nice, I've been meaning to meet up with some actual fashies for some time now! And no I'm a Protestant (not the gay pastor kind) but I really enjoy the Orthodox traditionalism and all that. And yes Mysterium Fasces are very good, Common Filth is my favorite though and you should definitely check him out if you hate fags haha
