	Good day sir. If I may, i would like to request info about your forum provider.
</p>

<p>
	I will be creating a page in the very near future for My Odalist family. We have lost forums before to to the terms of service agreements.
</p>

<p>
	This page is well made and I am sure it has had its share of zionist swine had an effort to remove it. Yet it still stands.
</p>

<p>
	Do you recommend the same forum provider, or is you changed would you choose another?
</p>

	Thanks for your time. Thulean.
