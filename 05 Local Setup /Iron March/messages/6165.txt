<p>Trying the best to keep my sanity. At the end of the day, the events are as significant as a bar brawl, nothing more. Pro-Western jew puppets are seemingly fighting pro-Russian jew puppets yet I'm sure that behind the curtains, both sides are in bed with each other. No matter who wins, Ukraine loses. The nationalist organizations have failed (actually, they didn't even try) to form a third force against the aforementioned crooks and most throw themselves behind the pro-EU camp. It's a comedy really, if it weren't so bitter I'd laugh my ass off.</p>
