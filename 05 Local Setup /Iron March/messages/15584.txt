	Hej! If you want to get stuff printed with your own designs I would recommend <a href="http://ultrasshop.com/" rel="external nofollow">http://ultrasshop.com/</a><br />
	You can get everything from stickers to flags and balaclavas with custom designs at decent prices, they offer stickers in all shapes and sizes.<br />
	Get stickers without the optional rain-resistance, I heard it's awful, the normal stickers stick well and are easy to place from my experience.<br />
	They're also very open-minded when it comes to NS imagery and even write on their Facebook page that "If you want a Che Guevara flag, go somewhere else".<br /><br />
	Hoppas detta kan vara av nytta.
