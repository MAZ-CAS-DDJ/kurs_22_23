	Hey Strumgeist,
</p>

<p>
	You seemed a little stressed out and on edge last time, so I thought I would wait a few days and then check back and see how you are doing. So, I hope you are doing better. But, you have got to make a choice man, either give up the drugs or give up fascism, you know you can't have both. I really do hope you are okay.
