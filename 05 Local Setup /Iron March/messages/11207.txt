<p>Not really sure what happened to Vladimir, I guess he betrayed Slavros in some manner. As for what I have been doing, I've been putting up stickers and posters in my area with other Atomwaffen folks, and have been working on a few projects. Really hoping League of the South, does another protest so Atomwaffen can be present. (Of course we won't be screaming 14/88, but we would wear good clothes bring our flags and a lot of Confederate flags)</p>
