<p>An good question. I will tell you what, I have always struggled with self cynicism; I never promote myself or my work because I feel that if it is good enough people will share it. retarded I know, but if you agree with me you know that my main thing is providing criticism of far right movements. mentioning my stuff on /new/ where relevant would be very helpful. I get alot of people who agree with me but never heard of my work before so I don't have a big enough reach.</p>
<p>Jacob always is looking for help with Attack's little brother Reaktion, especially as he is setting up a local group with Torren and /new/'s Half-white.</p>
