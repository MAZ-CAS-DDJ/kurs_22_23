Hooliganism is what will make fascism and nationalism an inherent universal concept and part of life, there's nothing better than being part of a brotherhood type of social circle. You see these guys on the weekend, have a right good laugh, see most of them at work all week, give each other a nod, a wink and have a bit of a laugh and then keep repeating the process. That's how it worked in England anyway, most of us end up getting a job working at the same place.</p>

Coming back to the women, most of them initiate violence, divorce and pretty much everything so they shouldn't be surprised when they get their teeth broken by a man who gets sick of their shit and hits back. I used to be into the manosphere a fair bit and I kept a lot of wisdom from it, but I broke my ties off with them over their excessive libertarianism (I can tolerate the moderate ones like Hans-Herman Hoppe and his supporters but have no time for people who kiss the ass of kikes and go on about liberal 'fascists' and America being corporatist). Fascism will give you natural game if you're raised up as one or at least get into the mindset from an early age, pretty much every fascist leader ever speaks for itself in this statement.</p>
