	I don't mind too much. National Socialists in Germany used it a few times themselves anyway. Doesn't have that sort of 'sting' to me because it is what I am unashamedly, it's just short for National Socialist. We've gone over in our reports on our site briefly that we prefer National Socialist but to me it's really no big deal. Same meaning, one is just faster to say.
