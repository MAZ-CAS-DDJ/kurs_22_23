<p>I'm not sure to what extent the Asian and Caucasian peoples in Russia have Indo-European roots. In any case, now I see your meaning. From an ethnonationalist perspective your opinions make sense; however, my concept of nation is not exclusively racial, so we'll have to agree to disagree regarding North American geopolitics. I retain, however, great interest in National Bolshevism, and will soon read Dugin's <em>Fascism-- Borderless and Red</em>. If you find any other great National Bolshevik/Eurasianist articles, please pass them on.</p>
