<p>Don't do it, you'll be tempted (I'd be too) but it'll only make matters worse. In fact, just keep your mouth shut as much as possible and tell him to just tell his story if he asks you something, get out of the 'treatment' after.</p>

<p>Besides, you won't have any ready sources or arguments at hand, he probably will. You're not an expert revisionist like Germar Rudolf and co. or the likes on CODOH forums, just some kid who read/watched a few redpills, now put under pressure. Don't bother, save your energy and anger for later in life.</p>
