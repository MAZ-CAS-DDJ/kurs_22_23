<p>As I mentioned in my reply to those who welcomed me, my switch came as a result of years of prayer, study, and historical reflection upon the gradual changes to the Papacy over time. I was already a ' Sedevacantist' and it was natural as time and honesty worked on me, to see that the intial Orthodoxy 'deposit of faith' which was entrusted to the Popes of Old Rome in the West began to dwindle, and novel and heretical doctrines over time began to creep in, a process of what some have called the 'dogmatization' of theological opinion. Scholasticism also had a bad influence. Chiefly though, the problem lied with the exaltation of Papal power always at the expense of what was taught and believed before. I'm more 'Roman', and i'm more 'Catholic' than I was before, but not 'roman catholic', holding instead to the One true right-believing Catholic and Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ. This is what i've come to believe. God Bless you and shine His Light upon you.</p>
