	My dad is a little and my Uncle , my parents won't let me near guns for obvious reasons , sort of afraid I might go full 1488 since they are aware of my beliefs and that I get angry at society sometimes. Also they're afraid I might kill myself or something since I have been depressed in the past.

	Plus I don't really want to deal with gun licenses and police checks and not having guns means less hassle to deal with cops like them falsifying your license so they can arrest you.
