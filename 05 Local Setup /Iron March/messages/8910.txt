<p>I don't give a fuck if I'm edgelord status! Crown me Queen of Edge! It's one of the simpler pleasures in life. Nothing compares to seeing someone fear you, it's amazing.</p>
<p>One reason I enjoy tumblr is watching people have an absolute meltdown over a fucking internet post. School was really fun for me. I went to highschool in a super liberal area, and I somehow got amazing teachers who let me deny the Holocaust/attack democracy/advocate violence etc.</p>
<p>Creep friendship is the best kind. But a fascist creep? I've hit the jackpot. I'm generally more folky, but corsets are pretty qt. Tell me about this fed visit!</p>
<p>And abbos are a special kind of pathetic. So many internet videos...</p>
