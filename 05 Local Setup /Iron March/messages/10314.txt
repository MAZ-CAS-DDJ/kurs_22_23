<p>ah okay I was wondering, yeah I've talked about religion with her a bit and she seems pretty knowledgeable on Catholicism and its history </p>
<p> </p>
<p>well arent you italian? Germanic paganism probably didnt fit you because of that reason. Youre lucky to have Roman Catholicism because its pretty much a successor to Roman Paganism, I even remember reading that most of the structure is based on the older institutions and some of the oldest catholic churches in Italy used to be roman temples, they just smashed the idols and replaced them with statues of jesus or mary. </p>

<p>the main problem of paganism is that most of the traditions and deeper teachings are lost. we know they existed, we know that paganism wasnt just the simple folk religion its been reduced to, but we can only gleam at some of the deeper parts of it. for every extremely deep and transcendent myth like the one of odin acquiring the runes, we have 10 myths of loki tricking Thor into crossdressing for comical effect. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>im of the opinion that to solve this we need to create new traditions based on the old ones but this leads to all sorts of larpy shit. The main reason is that most pagans will go "oh well we dont know anything about the old religion, might as well make shit up and pretend its the equal of the old religion"</p>
<p>this isnt true, we know of SOME of the traditions, and if we HEAVILY BASE the new ones on the old then it works, if we just make up fantasy crap then it doesnt. </p>
<p>For example, when I lived in Alaska I often went out into the swamps and bogs and offered knives to the gods by breaking them with my hands and burying them. I based this off the descriptions of ritual sacrifice among the Germans (after a battle they would take all of the enemies possessions, break them, and toss them into a bog)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My biggest hope for paganism right now is the book im working on. Basically im trying to compile every scrap of Germanic lore into one book, even the early Christian stories because the early Christian Germans were still heavily Pagan in thought process. And there are some myths and poems that other pagans and even people in general have never heard of, like the song of the sun or the chant of the valkyries, because theyre so obscure. To spread this knowledge would be my duty </p>
