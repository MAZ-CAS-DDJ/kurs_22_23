<p>I wouldn't consider NCOs officers either.  In the US Army an enlisted man can go to OCS and receive his commission as a 2nd Lieutenant.</p>
<p>I agree that you have to strenuously test the mettle and skill of prospective officers, but I think precautions also need to be taken that the process doesn't scare away too many people.  The last thing we want is an army with too few officers.</p>
<p>When you talking about parliament running the army jointly with the officer corps are you talking about a civilian head of the military or something more pervasive? </p>
<p>Ah, the secret police!  Now this sounds interesting.  I assume they would be in charge of making sure that citizens are not abusing their position for private gain and that unrest is not being fomented among the general population.  Is this correct? Would they have any special powers beyond your regular police or would they just be plain-clothed policemen with additional training?</p>
<p>Yeah, in formal writing that kind of apologizing makes me want to go Columbine on people. XD  Online I am more forgiving due to the informal nature of the communication that occurs in it and the fact that many people come here to test out their ideas.  There's also the fact that you are more likely to have a reasoned, open exchange of ideas with someone a little unsure of their ideas, as opposed to someone that is convinced they have just walked down from Mt. Sinai. </p>
<p>Good point about "trying to be ignorant."  Funny video, btw.</p>
