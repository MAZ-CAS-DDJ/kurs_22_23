<p>Thanks ferret.</p>
<p>I tell ya, sometimes I'm truly shocked by how Marxist some of the arguments some posters on here make. Never in my life did I think there would be people who call themselves Fascists suggesting the Marxists are right about Capitalism or that Fascism itself is Socialist! I don't know, I just hope people like you and me can make a difference on here and tackle the lies where ever they spring up.</p>
<p>God bless. Your bud, FascCap.</p>
