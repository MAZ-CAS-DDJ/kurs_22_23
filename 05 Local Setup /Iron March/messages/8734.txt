<p>The thing about Europe is that it's so small, too, it would be easy and cheaper to travel around. US and Australia are stupidly large.</p>

<p>Oh man, that's really bad. I think I know what you are saying(or not saying). Did she try to change your mind after? Did she go back to Buglaria? I know the feeling of finding something perfect. We had the same religion, worldview, wants in a family, everything. I don't want to think about how life would be if he never came back, but I don't think he's the kind of man I can move on from. it's scary to have found something perfect so early on, nothing else could compare to it. Deciding to leave, yeah... reminds me of how he felt, he always says he loves me and doesn't want anyone else, but he can't be with me. It's a sad situation.<br /><br />You liked helping her? Me too. Though it kindof backfired. When he was drunk, he said it made him feel like a bitch, that i would take care of him/my jobs/my family/my dad(terminally ill) and he couldn't get out of bed.</p>
