<p>So Saron is a Lutheran rite?  That's really all I'm seeing online, if so that'd be the reason we don't use that rite... we are an Orthodox church, so our rites are also.</p>
<p>EDIT:  nvm, I think you meant Sarum but that isn't Orthodox either, it's Catholic.</p>

<p>It's used in some Western RIte Parishes. Yea, I quit talking to Joe, I kind of regret it as he was a friend. But the "muh azn murrikans" things is autistic.</p>
<p><strong>	Modern Orthodox Usage</strong></p>
<p>The St Petroc Monastery <a href="http://orthodoxwiki.org/Western_Rite" rel="external nofollow">Western Rite</a> of the <a href="http://orthodoxwiki.org/Russian_Orthodox_Church_Outside_Russia" rel="external nofollow">Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia</a> has published the <em>Saint Colman Prayer Book</em> which includes <em>The Divine Liturgy (Sarum) Usus Cascadae</em>â€”the full Sarum Rite in English used in monasteries and missions in Australia, the Americas, and Europe. This Sarum use liturgy has also been translated into Spanish and French.</p>
<p>Among <a href="http://orthodoxwiki.org/Old_Calendarists" rel="external nofollow">Old Calendarists</a>, the Sarum rite has been used in approximately a dozen American parishes of the <a href="http://orthodoxwiki.org/Holy_Synod_of_Milan" rel="external nofollow">Holy Synod of Milan</a>, which has published Sarum translations in English and Serbian since 1993. Two versions of the complete Sarum text were published. The first, and still surviving, translation, is the Sarum series published by St Gregory's Press under the auspices of the <a href="http://orthodoxwiki.org/The_Abbey_of_the_Holy_Name_%28West_Milford,_New_Jersey%29" rel="external nofollow">The Abbey of the Holy Name (West Milford, New Jersey)</a>, comprising approximately 30 volumes, including the <em>Medieval Monastic Psalter</em>. The second is the <em>Orthodox Prayers of Old England</em> series, which comprises about eight volumes, including the <em>Old Sarum Rite Missal</em>, and was originally published by St Hilarion Press, now St John Cassian press. The usage was also the official use for the Western American diocese (the first series being the usage of the Eastern) for a number of years.</p>
<p>The Sarum was was also the basis of an "Old English Liturgy" prepared by Dom <a href="http://orthodoxwiki.org/index.php?title=Augustine_%28Whitfield%29&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" rel="external nofollow">Augustine (Whitfield)</a> of Mount Royal monastery.</p>
