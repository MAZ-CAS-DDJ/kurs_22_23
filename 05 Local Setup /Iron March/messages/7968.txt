<p>A year ago, I would have thought jack's actions, counter-productive, of no well-being in creating a Nationalist State, however, after grasping Fascism more and more, I've come to the conclusion that if you were to ally yourself with a movement as ballsy as jacks you would immediately separate the wheat from the chaff so to speak. The spirit of 'me ne frego' &amp; 'with bomb in hand, dagger in mouth', that mentality that gets shit done and which was the fascist rhetoric, from the start is admirable, how many of us can really say we show such traits. </p>
<p>Poor target I must say, perhaps a synagogue or green/lib/labour office would have been more apt, you don't need to bomb a gook restaurant to make the public realise there is an asian problem, nor will there community withdraw or cower as they have the protection of the state and  the support of their racially conscious community, perhaps poor timing to, like, yes, bob from The Order, but I need to read more to pass judgement. I think action needs to be backed up with a solid following....just like our fore runners (balls to putsch) &amp; people like Rockwell's man punching Martin Luther king.... </p>
<p>All Anglo nations seem to be fragmented like us, I think NA will set precedent In Britain and we need to follow sway, I think they do a good job separating that wheat from the chaff and for as long as they can keep there ranks pure, they will succeed, with the spirit of Horst Wessel on their side, how can they not! That youthful vigour, I don't give a damn attitude! And cool as fuck to boot....</p>
<p>I think there is relevance in Australia for an old labor/protectionism/henry lawsonism type party, but it needs to be backed with a cadre of ideologically pure and vigorous anti semite's who don't non chalantly attack the Jews, but focus on the seeable problems  and realise the masses will eventually attack the heart of the problem when all is revealed or dealt with, words are so easily spoken as you know mate, finding this cadre is what we should</p>
<p>Be doing...Iron march is a good start! </p>
<p>The mines are okay, stresses the fuck out of relationships...makes it real hard, building a relationship via  telecommunications...I've resorted to Savin apologies and commentary to copy paste to women nowadays, it's that fucked, but the comradery is good, almost all white men, workin together for a common goal...albeit a wholly capitalistic goal...gold as well so fuelin' international jewery one day at a time haha </p>
<p>I might take a look down the library this weekend, I'm enthused to read his book, I don't want to waste your time mate so don't fuss if it's to hard, it needs to be pdf'd though and put up here for longevity and inspiration to further our cause here. I already have a hard copy of track of the Jews and myth so unless it's another one of his books, thanks anyway mate! Typing of a phone at smoko is a bit of a cunt, I apologise for me rant aswell haha.</p>
