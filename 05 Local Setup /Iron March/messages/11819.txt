<p>Hey Hadit,</p>
<p>Blackshirt 13 here. Hope your Christmas went well. If you don't mind me asking you, are you currently in college? If so, what are you majoring in? I learned last semester that Nietzsche thought that the only difference between liberal democracy and socialism is a difference of degree/severity. Which is exactly how I feel. Guess I am influenced by Nietzsche more then I thought. Anyways hope your Christmas went well, and hope to here from you soon.</p>
<p>Hail,</p>
