<p>Ahh right, so she messed up as she was a woman who ignored the warnings. I understand. I'm going to put aside any sort of 'Christian' beliefs for a while and explore the various religions and things like Hermeticism.</p>

<p>I planned to read through Evola's works first, as you explained a good order to read them in but are there any other books you'd suggest reading in the middle? I plan to delve into some of Guenon's works once I'm done with Evola (which is probably a long time away) and maybe even Savitri Devi. Books on the personal level are helpful, too.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
