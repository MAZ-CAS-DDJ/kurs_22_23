<p>Yah, I dont like the idea of a wholey new man. People hate change as it is, best not to openly agitate that. But I would seek to make the Canadian Man more Canadian. With loyalty to the state. Because the state is your friend, the state has eaveryones best intrests in mind.</p>
<p>And yes we should avoid having a hoard of cultureless mongrels. If that was the case we may as well be americans and in my eyes Americans are like animals. They are light rats climbing over eachother in a mass of filth and they love it. It is most disgusting.</p>
<p>But we need to have a Canadian bridging culture. Hokey, beer tims and so on that all our people would have in common and can sit down and talk about in nearly any given social setting. Kinda like how one time when I was getting gas an East Indian Guy was the attendant. I was diring a shit car and had to pop the trunk to open the fule cap cover. I had a couple empty cases of Heinikan in the trunk. The guy saw them and said it was good beer and I couldent agree more with him.</p>
<p>That is the type of thing I want to foster. Diffrent background and culture, common society.</p>
<p>But that can only be tested in practace.</p>
<p>But at the core will be a new state that is free from forgien influinces and we can finaly build our own future and rely on ourselves.</p>
<p>While we watch america crumble and laugh.</p>
