		As long as I'm safe, healthy, and treated well, I have no issue living humbly. I don't need extravagance. I liked that about rural Russia, and the cities I saw even seemed much more conservative than American ones. Some areas of Moscow looked like they have crime problems though.<br /><br />
		Men have definitely been getting less masculine lately, most women here complain about that quietly a lot. Guys today are often wimpy, also they rarely take care of themselves so their bodies are often gross. No girl is attracted to that. We want confidence and strength.

		Here, if you're in history, English, or any of the social sciences, good luck finding a professor who's not a Marxist. I decided against psychology as a minor partly based on that, instead I'm a biology minor because the hard sciences are slightly less affected by all this stuff. And a music major, and even we're stuck playing modernist atonal stuff half the time.<br /><br />
		I was raised Russian Orthodox, for the record. I'm not especially religious, but it seems to help bind communities together and foster a healthy social environment.<br /><br />
		Also, I'm learning a lot already. :) I like the board a lot so far.
