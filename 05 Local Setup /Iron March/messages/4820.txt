<p>The form of Christian Identity I am working with is Dual Seedline and British Israelism along the Phinehas Priesthood method, it has a lot of similarities to the lone wolf strategy on one hand and on the other it appeals to those who are likely to do something, those who have a lust to kill somebody or have it in them to begin with at the drop of a hat; this type of ideology is popular with prisoners and survivalists in the united states. If you make it look like they've done it for a righteous cause and God approves of it then you are pretty much sorted; most of these people are looking for validation anyway, I see no problem in using these type of people for our ends whether they are sincere christians or insincere ones.</p>
<p>Many people here are secularists or are traditionally catholics, as you've said. The secularists are easy to work with because - I will give the benefit of the doubt to people - they know something is up and that things were atleast a lot better back in the days when religion thrived, they were certainly safer. Dealing with them is a matter of good arguments in opposition to the "naturalist atheists" who don't have a good grasp of nature or the design of it in any way; they automatically assume that because there are earthquakes it is all doom and gloom and there are no natural positive effects to an earthquake. At the most you will get crude darwinists who say it was beneficial at killing a bunch of Haitians, and while true to its own extent it's a simplistic look.</p>
<p>As for denominations and going to church, whether the elect meet in one church building or another with slightly different beliefs is of little importance since ultimate unity will be realized at the eschaton. God in his providence allows for competition among viewpoints so that the truth will be revealed and refined (1 Corinthians 11:19). In this case, disunity is a means unto an end<strong>. </strong>The appeal to John 10:16 and John 17:20-21 is eisegetical rather than an institutional unity (see John 11:51-52). This is what will appeal to secularists to convert, they don't have to deal with Catholic bullshit and going to church is of secondary importance rather than a primary one. All that matters are principles, not semantics.</p>
<p>It needs to work on a personal level and works best by recruiting within prisons and those looking for an answer. It's easier to use the religious people and radicalize them further by showing them the passages like the Deuteronomy passage in my profile and the passages which declare niggers to be beasts.</p>
<p>I know many of you have probably read Erectus walks amongst us and of course there's a lot of speculation and interpretation through an evolutionary scope, but that is not to say there is no truth to the book at all, especially with regards to genetic distance, primitive traits and genetic recombination; not to mention the last few chapters of the book dealing with social policies.</p>

<p>This chapter in particular is what I want to raise with you. It seems the bible YET AGAIN has beaten the "evolutionists" and scientists to the punch with regards to taxonomy and wisdom with regards to being able to mix with species; it certainly aligns with it anyway. The bible regards blacks as beasts, but it's only Christian Identity whom point this out; even kinists dance around this obvious issue, just choosing to ignore the points raised and which can be checked in the bible for themselves. Pastor Butler and Bertrand L. Comparet have dealt with this question in detail:</p>

<p>However, Pastor Allan Campbell does this research much more justice in the following sermon which I highly recommend you all to listen to, he touches on some small but very significant issues which both Butler and Comparet have missed, especially in regards to Exodus. He really puts it all into perspective, even teaching that these beasts do have souls and can be saved, but they have their different duties and positions and are not to be mixed with (as we all know if we've read the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, not to mention the command in Deuteronomy 23:2).</p>

<p>If you can give people answers they will come and they will do justice for it. When there are passages which give people excuses to kill and tug on their primal insticts people will jump onto it:</p>
<p><iframe src="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/2447-a-time-to-kill/&amp;do=embed" frameborder="0" data-embedcontent=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Exodus 22:2-3</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>In other words threat to our lives, family and property is to be met with lethal force.</strong></strong></p>
<p>The point that stuck out to me at the end of that excerpt from Hunter was this:</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="1780" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>They have this completely nutty version of history, which no one who’s paid attention in his high school history class can believe.”</div></blockquote>
<p>That's true enough. There are only a few Christian Identists I've met who haven't acted like your Bill o'reilly types, they don't do much reading or reasoning for themselves which is where proper doctrine and explanation would need to come in.</p>

<p>As far as I see it secularism does not have the strength to combat islam or talmudic judaism which is basically just ethnocentric pantheism. Christianity allows people to drink, smoke, kill when it's right, be 'tolerant' when it's right and have pre-marital sex and many wives (although these teachings aren't popular, people should jsut start doing them anyway) but it does tread a fine line, it holds a middle ground.</p>
<p>I'm currently reading a book called Vigilantes of Christendom. <a href="http://greatwhitedesert.org/documents/Hoskins_-_Vigilantes_of_Christendom.pdf" rel="external nofollow">http://greatwhitedesert.org/documents/Hoskins_-_Vigilantes_of_Christendom.pdf</a></p>
<p>The foreword gives a good and quick insight into the radicalism of the ideology. IIRC Breivik talked of a brotherhood and a conservative christian syndicate being formed inside the prisons and I think this is a good idea, these people have little to lose when they come out because nobody will offer them a job.</p>
<p>I'm just bouncing ideas around. As a whole it's beneficial to support christianity anyway (not the meek, anti-nationalist versions) because it's in line with the principles we stand for anyway, but it works especially well with prisoners who have plenty of time to read, see the race issue up front and can relate to the issues more.</p>
