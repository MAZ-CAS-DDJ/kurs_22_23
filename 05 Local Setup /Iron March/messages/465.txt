It is my opinion that Hitler surrounded himself around too many esoterics such as Himmler and the order of Thule. He wasn't even very fond of Asatru/Germanic heathenry. </div></blockquote>
<p>I think the link between the NSDAP and Ariosophist groups is largely exaggerated. There is no “occult roots of Nazism”; the idea was pretty much just exaggerated by Judeo-Christians (i.e. Philo-Semitic Christian Zionists) who wanted to separate Christianity from NS as Christianity used to have a tradition of anti-Semitism and thus seemed linked with NS. The Thule Society was not even as significant as some historians say it was; in reality it had only little influence and not much impact on anybody or anything. I could get into the details but I don’t think it’s necessary.</p>

<p>Official NSDAP policy was that people’s religion didn’t matter as long as that religion was not harmful to the race and did not get in the way of National Socialism. This is stated in Mein Kampf and I think Hitler meant it. I agree with your assessment of Hitler’s religion, I don’t think Hitler was a Germanic Pagan; I believe he had his own unique personal beliefs when it came to god and I don’t think he cared about what others believed.</p>

<p>Stormfront is shit, but I actually liked eNat. I have the opposite impression of the people here than you do. I don’t think the people here are at all intellectual and I feel that I could intellectually crush them any day. I think their problem is stubbornness. I will however spend a little bit of more time here and make a few more posts to see if I can get them thinking a little bit.</p>
<p>I think I made a bit of a blunder with that Israeli organ trafficking thing. I believed that article to be accurate because I found it on a professional news website. I have contacted Karl Radl (you know, the anti-Semitic professor from the University of New York which I told you about) and I asked him what he thinks about the issue. If anybody should know Karl should, I swear he is practically all-knowing when it comes to matters regarding the Jews.</p>

Tribalism, which is what I adhere to, or being a crazy reactionary and simply believing in a nation because it happens to be there are really the only answers to globalism. I am not even sure I like the word Nationalist, as it implies separating Europeans on stupid grounds such as different anthems, flags, and lines in the ground when we are really all part of one big family and should unite. I would like to see a United States of Europe one day as Strasser advocated for. </div></blockquote>
<p>It is sort of Nationalism, it is Racial-Nationalism essentially – the idea that you are racialist and Nationalist in regards to your race and not just your own nationality.</p>
<p>I agree that we should have pan-Europeanism, but I think all of the different ethnic groups and sub-races of Europe ought to be preserved, at least in Europe, though I don’t think that can be accomplished in North America or Australia since those are not of any particular European nationality.</p>

I think he is too obsessed with eastern occultism and caste systems; though I like his criticisms of modern society and I consider myself a traditionalist to a degree. Throughout my readings of Strasser and Evola I have found some common connections between their ideologies and found some inspiration in that. Both want to return to a more traditional European society and Strasser based his socialism on a traditional European guild system where hierarchy is completely necessary and left in tact. He, unlike Evola, propounds the need to root out injustices of such a system and actually gives us idea how we could develop such a system out of the ruins of degenerate capitalism. </div></blockquote>
<p>Evola is such a shithead, excuse my language. He creates a biased analysis of history (no doubt influenced by his aristocratic background) and then calls it “Tradition” to make it sound appealing. I think there are better thinkers out there who support preserving European tradition, culture and race and do a much better job at justifying their beliefs than Evola, such as the ones I listed out in my introduction thread on this forum to name a few.</p>

I enjoyed them especially the biography as it recapped a lot of what I read and what I actually forgot from "For my Legionaries". I do have one question, I have always had a curiosity about the man Constantin Pancu. I thought the whole fighting circle thing and him coming out on top was grand. Do you have more information on him? </div></blockquote>
<p>Funny you should ask about Pancu, I wanted to know more about him as well when I read “For My Legionaries.” I looked through all available Legionary sources I could find and I unfortunately could not find much on him. Everybody, both dead Legionary figures and modern day Legionary intellectuals, don't say much other than summarizing what Codreanu said about Pancu. So unfortunately Pancu is a bit of a dead end.</p>

<p>Yes, I have heard of this song before. That video even shows some monasteries I have been to in the beginning.</p>
<p>About the lyrics to the songs, I will get to translating a couple this afternoon.</p>

Regardless, in reference to the thread I really don't think the Jews have a claim to Palestine considering the thousands of families that were there when they moved in - and appeals that that is their holy land really mean nothing to me. </div></blockquote>
<p>I assure you that the Khazar thing is trash, so don’t go on making that claim anymore as it is an outdated theory. When the Jews first went into Israel it was not very populated and I think that is why they tried to take it in the first place. They were however offered better lands such as Madagascar by the British, but they insisted on Palestine because the big old kike in the clouds said it was their land.</p>
