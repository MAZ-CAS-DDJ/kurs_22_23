<p>Ah, but there's the rub. What exactly are the traditions of Sumeria that we Jews are carrying on?</p>
<p>Perhaps the Torah shows Sumerian influence (Gilgamesh and Enkidu and Noach and all that) but I think that the Nevi'im and Ketuvim, and of course the Talmud, Judaism evolved into something more. I would have no problem being a spiritual descendant of the Sumerians if they stood for what we stood for (ethical monotheism, serve G-d in all things, and the principle of <em>life above all else</em>), but I can't give am educated opinion as I have no idea what the Sumerians stood for.</p>
<p>In my travels through the Internetz, I have seen a lot of anti-Semites (now that the Khazar theory has been discredited) use the whole "Jooz stole from da Sumerianzzz!" thing, so I am a little wary of this approach.</p>
<p>With a proper explanation, however, I am sure I could warm to the idea.</p>
