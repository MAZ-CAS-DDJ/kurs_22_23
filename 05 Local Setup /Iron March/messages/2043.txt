<p>"Like Hitler did do you read "My struggle"?"</p>
<p>I did not read it yet, but i will try. Try until you complete it, they say. There's one on aryanism.net.</p>
<p>"You know that there is no how this not happen,,, In socialism we sheltered some Vietnamese refugees back then and in the beginning all is fine: Red Brothers, Equality, Workers Unite kinds of stuff... but just in five years they menaged to make us hate and finaly throw them away... In one country have place only for one nation... With very little exceptions i mean when you have different ethnic group but in you culture something like "Sub culture" , "sub nation" in a good meaning like we have with Chuvashians and Gagauzians.. I dont know if you understand me this is rooted in Iranian culture when some other nations or small ethnic groups willingly came under your rule and adopt your culture and be proud of it.. Its complicated the bots sides benefict of it and dont mixed up and pff its very dificult for me to explain to you it was common in middle Asia in medieval time when some Turkic tribes become "sub nations" with Iranians it is different of enslavement and so..."</p>
<p>The Vietnamese fucked it up within 5 years. Its their fault. Good you sent them back to their homeland. Thry should spend their energy in making their country less bad. </p>
<p>We also have this subnation thing, though we are more regionalist/tribalist. In my ideal state, they can keep their cultures, as long as they accept that they are Filipinos and not people of different regions, and of course loyalty to the state.</p>
<p>I Wish you the very best in saving your country from the liberal cesspool. </p>
<p>Anyways, any thoughts on your country's monarchy? Should it be created once more? Or you are saying no to a monarchy?</p>
