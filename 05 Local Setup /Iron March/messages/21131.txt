	I've been doing well. Had the tumor removed last year in August. It was wrapped around my sympathetic nerve and was causing fight-or-flight 24/7. Was intense. Now I'm just working and considering going back to school.<br /><br />
	New Hampshire is getting worse by the day. We're shipping in refugees everywhere. Tons of faggots and dykes. It's getting ruined by faggots from Mass.<br /><br />
	IM forum has more autism, but the communist is full on Siege mindset now. Which is great. <br /><br />
	Saw you mention you were locked up. Finally got caught for your nig bashing?
