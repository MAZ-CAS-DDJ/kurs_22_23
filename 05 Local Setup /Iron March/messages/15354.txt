	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	I have a big interest for radical nationalism all over the world, and the canadian NS movement it's for me one of the most intersting, because many texts it's in french language.
</p>

<p>
	You have a big chance to meet a veterans of this movement, I want to know if you have a pictures of uniforms or insignias of the movement? (If you're interested, I could send you a pictures of my personnal collection of nationalist/fascist/NR/racialist inisgnias all over the world and history)
</p>

<p>
	Kind regards,
</p>
