<p>The distributist idea was always really interesting to me. I'm a fan of Chesterton anyways but his writings on the distributism really put him on my favorites list. I agree that it probably wouldn't work on a large scale, it always seemed difficult to implement, even in a limited sense.</p>
<p>Max Weber's book is actually very interesting to me, what I've decided is that the Catholic church fosters cultural growth while the protestant church fosters economic growth. Obviously I would like to find a way to get the best of both churches (hopefully without the corruption of Rome.)</p>
<p>The Orthodox church always interested me, especially in its early years, but at this point its a barely existent sect without a lot of depth theologically.</p>
