<p>Lol, don't worry, no offense taken. I get that reaction all the time, IRL. Online most people assume I'm white until I correct them! <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p>Well, my fascination with Fascism is quite long since I was little, infact. See, though I "identify" as black, I'm of mixed ancestry. My material grandmother is German, so from a very young age I was aware of Nazism and such, but it wasn't until later in my Highschool years that I dared to actually study Nazi doctrine. At that time I was already becoming somewhat of a racial nationalist ( black nationalist socialism in my case) I'd read up about and become influenced by Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey. Reading about Nazism, oddly enough, strengthened my race nationalism. I was in total awe of Hitler and National Socialism, I felt that there should be a pan-Africanist movement that should be National Socialist in character in order to bring about a "rebirth" of the black race.</p>
<p>Luckily, my curiousity lead me to study Italian Fascism as well. After a period of deep thought, I found Italian Fascism to be more practical and less divisive. After a few years of being Fascist , through which I'd also been reading more about the Fascist-Socialist relationship. I stop considering myself Fascist, and instead became a sort of Syndicalist. My goal is to basically create a replacement for Fascism, a Socialist alternative to it. It will succeed Fascism as the dominant third position ideology.</p>
