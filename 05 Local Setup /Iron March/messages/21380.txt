	Yeah, i used to run but it is extremely boring even with my headphones on. Though i did 3-4 kms, 18 without a stop is going to be a huge challenge. I prefer the gym though, want to get a bit bigger and get rid of some bellyfat I have. I do rope jumping from time to time for that matter or ride the bike in the gym (since we dont have a treadmil :D ) .
