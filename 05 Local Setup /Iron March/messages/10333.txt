<p>Hey!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don't remember exactly what I was referring to in that chat. Probably just thinking about the financial collapse (ie. collapse of US dollar, bursting of the "china bubble", breakup of the EU, etc). There's a lot of things that will inevitably collapse, since they're built on clouds and illusions, though no one can predict the timing. In principle, you should be able to figure it out through <em>mundane </em>astrology, though that is the most advanced branch and I don't know anything about it.</p>

<p>As for shemitah, sounds like nonsense to me. Jews twist their religion to make money, not the other way around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Either way, I don't think we have to worry about the immediate future - collapse isn't in the interest of those in power obviously, so they're going to do whatever they can to keep the game running as long as possible - the most likely outcome is a long, agonizing decline.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ps. I had a good time in the countryside, will post pictures soon.</p>
