<p>Hey mate, don't stress about the late replies. You're clearly working a lot and in an industry where you don't have a lot of time to piss away on the net like me, so I'm not bothered. This is gonna be another long essay rant but there's some stuff in here (especially at the end) I've been mulling over &amp; wanted to sound you out on for a while, so hope you don't mind slogging through all this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your point about Germans working with Japs &amp; Turks is a really good analogy- our non-whites are here amongst us, displacing us, the situation we're in is different and a million times worse to anything back in the day. Reading Mein Kampf made me aware how little things had changed in some ways (Hitler's dissection of Austria-Hungary's multiculturalism is <em>completely</em> relevant to us, as is practically everything else he talks about), but also how in another way they're a million times worse. Austria-Hungry was just dealing with Slavs and Jews... and Slavs as Europeans weren't as big a problem in hindsight. We're dealing with people completely alien to us, while dismantling our entire history and identity to boot. I guess I have just become complacent. I grew up in Geraldton which was almost entirely white in the 90s apart from the abos, actually remember gawking at the first Vietnamese families when they moved into the area. Living in Dullsville so long has desensitised me, clearly. Having to constantly compromise my ideals so I don't end up unemployed doesn't help either.</p>

<p>It's been sweet seeing your thread getting used more. Agree it needs to move on from just being an info-dump/history yarn-fest, coming to a consensus on our situation and developing strategies is important- doing, not talking, tho maybe we should set up a new thread for that.. I'm with you on us being in a way better position than the US- as I said in that thread, ABS figures show we're still around 90% Anglo-Celtic, in reality it's probably a bit less but we still have a much more cohesive society than the US &amp; UK. If you look at the UK you can see they have NO sense of community left, NO sense of racial or even <em>cultural</em> identity because it has all been completely trashed by cultural marxist white guilt, they are having to rebuild from the ground up since the UK has literally just become only a set of geographic borders shared by a mess of different people with no commonalities apart from shared citizenship. Whites are literally being waged war on in their own country, &amp; their government is enabling it. The US is similar but they never had the advantage of originally being ethnically homogenous with a centuries-old organic culture to fall back on like the UK, there is no reason for them not to pursue secessionist tactics since they have no real choice but to start something new.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're different. For one thing, we're still mostly white. We do have way too much white guilt/PC bullshit going on, but most Aussies (even liberal middle-class Aussies) think it's crap, you'd never see our schools banning 'Baa baa black sheep' for 'racism' like has happened in the UK, we roll our eyes at that over-the-top mental shit even if we do occasionally let our governments implement some PC bullcrap. White Aussies also still have a common sense of identity and values &amp; we're still largely racist. That stuff <em>is</em> being eroded ('multiculturalism' and 'tolerance' being lauded as Aussie values now by lots of ordinary people, for instance) but our attitude towards refugees or Chinese investment show the erosion is only skin-deep so far. I honestly think we can somehow tap into these innate convictions and show people they have deep roots in our nationalist-socialist history (Old Labor values or whatever we want to call them, what made Australia <em>Australia</em>), really make them conscious of and concerned about the way their country is being slowly dismantled beneath them. The hard part is figuring out how, especially how to break through Aussie political apathy, noone except One Nation have really had much success with this yet. I agree though that at this point, we don't need to trash everything and start again. Even if we rejected the monarchy &amp; our British-colonialist heritage we'd still have a pretty solid amount of nationalist-republican history to centre our identity on.</p>

<p>As you've said before, nationalist leanings are really strong in workers/bogans, they would make a great starting point, their youth are way less sold on anti-racism/LGBT rights than middle-class young people. I'd love to get a good chunk of middle-class students &amp; professionals on side like Golden Dawn has but that is a <em>hard</em> sell, they tend to be most indoctrinated &amp; are probably not a good starting point (even if I am one of them <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> ). I've been thinking a lot about activism lately, I'm keen on starting something rather than just bitching online, and have a few ideas. If we meet up &amp; hit it off, stickering, graffiti &amp; pasting up leaflets would be a good start- I'm shit at graphic design but we could steal images from IM &amp; elsewhere; hadn't thought of tarps, but that'd be great too. Someone also gave me <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/34-trivial-happenings/page-126" rel="">a great idea here for a multimedia propaganda piece</a>, I'm shit at tech stuff but I reckon I could find someone to help out with editing the audio/footage, possibly on IM. I'm also thinking of holding my nose &amp; joining Aus First (or even trying to contact NatAlt, worth a shot...) to build connections. Ideally I'd like to start off small, doing simple activism on my own or with 1 or 2 others, but slowly develop enough connections that we could get an Aussie NA-style group going- or at least have a decent-sized, loosely-organised group (even if it's mostly net-based) with skills in graphics, web design, &amp; multimedia to be able to start getting a coherent message out there, online &amp; off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is all me brainstorming btw, I'm not outlining a definite plan of attack that I demand you get involved in. We might actually hate each other when we meet, lol. But we NEED an Australian National Action, and it'd be a slow process but I think it could be pulled off. Let me know if you're keen or have any ideas, I'm sure after we've slathered Perth with a few GAS THE KIKES tags strategies will inevitably start coming to us.</p>
