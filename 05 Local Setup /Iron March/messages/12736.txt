<p>Ah, that makes sense. That's probably why all the liberals like the superhero(villain?) with roughly the same personality. Sources are what really suck, regarding old European religions- they were only compiled in Christian times, so who knows what the authors changed or left out? Did you see there was apparently a wolf over Sweden in the Northern lights, so Ragnar√∂k is nigh? No problem! Myths are interesting, as are your views on them. Absolutely. And worse are the people who like him for the promises of free stuff (as if any politician has delivered) and because he's a 'cute old man'. Ick.</p>
<p>Really? It's a dance from the south of Spain which involves a lot of stamping and castanets. You've probably seen some cartoon of a Spanish lady in a weird ruffly dress with a guitar player nearby. Wander and meditate in the desert? For 40 days while being tempted by the devil? Jk. Seriously wish I had the strength and discipline for that tho. Do you personally commune with the gods or see visions? Definitely. Not only do they not have much at stake, but they often come from cultures with healthy self-respect. The white race is so cucked that I wonder at times if its worth saving... and then realise we're doing it more for their children, and not for those already lost. Unless you rejoin the Amish or found your own agricultural fascist community, it'll be hard to raise children in this world. Only a new world would be safe, but that will take a bit of time yet. At least a fascist farmer collective sounds fun. Your highschool had Prussian history textbooks just lying around? I'm jealous. 100% agree. They'd already defeated Germany, so why dismantle a state within Germany? Just to crush the people's spirit. I want one of those too, but the Austrian part of me feels that would be wrong.</p>
