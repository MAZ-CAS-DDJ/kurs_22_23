	Okay mate I'll start reading these after I finish the book i'm reading at the moment. I was going to buy "The Myth Of The Twentieth Century" in a bookshop near me, but i didn't have any spare money at the time and when I went back It was gone haha, I'll probably order it off the net because books of National Socialism are rare to come across these days.

	I'll start watching those videos in a bit as well. Cheers for the material.
