<p>Like I said, it's still under construction and is not meant to be seen in its present form, I only directed you there because it is an easy way to get to the attack journals and the blog, which contain the most accessable ideological material.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="206" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>Does anybody take you seriously?</div></blockquote>
<p>The movement is still in its infancy and has yet to be properly launched. I don't know the exact figure but I'd guess that there are no more than a few dozen active members. I doubt anyone has ever even heard of us.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-contentapp="core" data-ipsquote-contenttype="messaging" data-ipsquote-contentid="206" data-ipsquote-contentclass="core_Messenger_Conversation"><div>It's like your members of the IRA.</div></blockquote>
<p>The millitant aesthetics are intentional. To try to appear like a serious big time political party would be both misleading and utterly useless, there are scores of British nationalist parties that are all doing just that, trying to mascerade as liberals, it really doesn't work and just ends up looking limp and weak. See Nick Griffin on question time for a cringeworthy example of this. We wish to appear to be the antithesis of the modern political class. But in truth I'm just involved for the ideology I am indifferent to the millitant aesthetics. I believe that using it was the idea of Benjamin Noyles, the ideological kingpin of the movement, to present ourselves in such a way. He posts on this form under that name and is probably far more qualified to take your enquiries than I am.</p>

<p>Again, the site is under construction, I directed you there because the attack journals give some idea of an integralists world view and how we look at the modern world, the blog also does this but is more geared towards current events.</p>
