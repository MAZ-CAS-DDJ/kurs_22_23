<p>Just weights, I have adjustable dumbbells I use. They work well enough but I need to start going to the gym with my friend. Its just hard cause I live in a rural place. </p>

<p>And I'm reading the Heimskringla. It's a history of the Norse kings going from Odin to King Magnus. Very interesting read if you're into direct accounts of history. </p>

<p>Yeah 'm still pretty new here but I like it as well, sure beats the hell out of stormfront. </p>
