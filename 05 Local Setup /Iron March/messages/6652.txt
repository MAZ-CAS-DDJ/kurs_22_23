<p>Anything you wish to discuss, is fine with me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>those topics don't sound bad, i'd like to know:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- What most interests you about the reich?</p>
<p>- What do you find most appealing about Aryan men, as apposed to non?</p>
<p>- What roles do you feel a woman can or should fulfill in a political movement, or after a fascist/NS state has been established? Do you feel women's roles are of great importance? More, less, or equal to the importance of male roles?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And i understand about the late reply. Real life is more important than checking a website. </p>
