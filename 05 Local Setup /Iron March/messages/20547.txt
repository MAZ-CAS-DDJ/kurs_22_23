	My profile pic is from the black legion which was a paramilitary kkk splinter group which was pretty cool. They had a pirate aesthetic and everything. Anyway no I'm not in the KKK or associated with it (except maybe friends of friends). I was inspired to change my profile pic and shit because of the Daniel Carver videos. I will probably ride the meme a bit longer before changing it though.
