			Hey! Thought like sending a message so we don't clutter up the intro thread. Sorry if I seem so eager to talk, it's just very cool and rare to meet another musician who's into Fascism, as most people in the art world seem to be full-blown liberals/SJWs, as I'm sure you know. I'm actually in the process of writing an article for IronMarch's webzine, NOOSE, about classical music and my own theories on why modern artists seem to be so left-leaning.

			By the way, if you don't have a skype account already, you should get one, as a lot of us here on IronMarch have our own little skype community as well.

	I look forward to reading it, I've noticed the same thing. There are more personally conservative types in classical music (not so much popular) than the visual arts or theater, where basically everyone is totally out-there. But the classical music world is trudging in that direction too.<br /><br />
	Really? Cool! :) I have an account, but I'm not 100% sure I want to give out my last name on here so quickly. Outing myself as fascist would lead to pretty terrible consequences anywhere, but especially in this part of the country.<br /><br />
	So I'll probably make a side-account, and then add you there.
