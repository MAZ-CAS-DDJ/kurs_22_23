	Hello Vasiszta! How's it going with you? It's been almost a month now and I still haven't responded, so I felt like apologizing again but then I figured we should have already moved past that kinda thing already, lol. Anyway, so the reason why it's taking so long is because I've decided to make my way through the various material you've been sending me (the Hungarian articles, the Dugin videos, the architecture blog, the two books, etc etc), and I'm also trying to make sense of Slavros' notebooks, plus some of the more usual stuff about alchemy and magic…so yeah it's gonna take a while. I figure, so far our conversation has been very unequal (you're like here: <img alt=":ss:" data-emoticon="" src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/default_ss.png" title=":ss:" />, and meanwhile I'm here:  <img alt=":kkk:" data-emoticon="" src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/default_kkk.png" title=":kkk:" />). So I'm trying to gradually close the gap a bit, and that would become more fun too in fact, since I have a few cool ideas about some constructive stuff we could examine. It's just that I need to confirm some of my suspicions before delving deeper (all the evidence so far points to it, but I just need to verify it all).

	But yeah, that's why I'm taking so long. Plus, Newroz is also just around the corner, so we've been very busy making preparations for it. Anyway, I hope all's going well for you. I'll post my response in about a week or two.
