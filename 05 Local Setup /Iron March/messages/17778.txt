	<strong>The most successful group is the Golden Dawn</strong>, but what they did worked by doing a multi-tiered strategy and they<strong> DON'T HAVE MASS SUPPORT OR MASS MOBILIZATION</strong>, they merely hold a portion of seats in parliamentary democracy, they do it mainly by action DIRECTLY helping and fighting for people as a paramilitary force AND because of hopeless circumstances that lead to the dissolution of the main parties (all circumstances we don't have). Not speeches, marches or peaceful protest but boots on the ground fighting, multiple decentralized cells, working directly with communities &amp; leadership:

	"The greatest nationalist party in Europe today is the Greek Golden Dawn simply because it has accepted ideas that WORK. Practice made theory, and theory based on practice ensured political power– the party, like all, started out local, and went through the laborious work of constructing cells, building trust in the community, developing leadership cadres and paramilitary forces because they were a necessity for giving food to the poor, fighting anarchists and immigrants. So then in 2012 as if spontaneously, after 30 years of waiting, the Greek people simply lost hope in the system, both major parties collapsed and the cruelty of circumstance gave way to radicals. They have members in parliament, unlike many other parties in Europe, they are actually doing something with these.

	The party is absolutely unapologetic for its national socialist stance, nor for the often times violent behavior of their members in defending the Greek people, but most importantly they are constantly active. ideology and practice go together; their militant ideology has developed and will continue to crystallize with struggle because the greatest weapons tied only to those capable of using them. Power has given them real respect, from their integration into the police forces and metal music scene, to their signing away of parliamentary privileges to the poor; their working and living with people –

	in all these cases they had something to offer because they had power. In one of the major centers of smuggling illegal immigrants, the port of Patras, the citizens became enraged after a young man was killed by three Afghans for owning a dog. They formed a mob, lead and incited by the Golden Dawn, they approached an old factory where thousands of illegal squatters were located, to find that the police were guarding them. After days in which the police used tear gas against local demonstrators, the people did not give up, and after several days of brutal fighting, the police were given the governmental order to evict the immigrants and check and prosecute any ships docked in the harbour carrying more. The Golden Dawn holds 22% of public support as of September 2012." Open letter to the white man, by Vladimir pg.90

	As you can see, its not mass mobilization that does it. <strong>The left have known for a long time</strong> that you can win with a smaller force, awakening and unifying revolutionaries physically and in spirit (ie knowing who your audience is). In the US they have used subcultures, corrupt politicians and academia funded by foreign investment bankers &amp; Israeli lobbyists to do alot of the work for them in order to affect the mainstream. In Russia the workers where a small portion of the population, at most ~20%. The Soviets where a very small force acting on behalf of the workers and where able to seize power because they took over govt buildings and checkpoints despite most Russians hating them. The difference is we wouldn't use this to establish any replacement federal govt. The Bolsheviks were more of a subversive and counter-culture ideology than we are today &amp; just as universally hated (esp. in the west). The difference being we have a all encompassing (whole of life) world-view that strives for the restoration of truth, to live it. Not to sweep away any knowledge we feel uncomfortable with or doesn't mesh with the status quo.

	Populism is the dominant culture which is historical or temporal, it shifts and is not easily swayed even with mainstream mass propaganda, and certainly not concerned with truth. In the US its just a more or less cucked version of what came before it.
