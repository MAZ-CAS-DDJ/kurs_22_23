<p>I agree with Mises and Friedman on a lot but unfortunately libertarianism, which I've flirted with, cannot work in a modernist, liberal world. Ultimately, I want to see a return to traditional, strong conservative values and common sense economic and business practices. So I guess I'm not as extreme as all the jackbooted uniform wearers who play Internet warrior but I am way outside the political mainstream and most people here can at least appreciate my view.</p>
