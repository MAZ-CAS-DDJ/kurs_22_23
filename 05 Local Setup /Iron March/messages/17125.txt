	Ya he told me to read siege, then anything rockwell. Last thursday he said maybe someone could talk with me but had not heard anything since. I sent him another PM earlier today inquiring on just general area and how often OH chapter does meet but dont want to bother him about it to much and dont know if hes even okay giving that info out yet even if generalized (understandably so). I figure he's either busy or not in a hurry, either way he'll get back to me when he can. He tends to be on hours before/after me, although ill be on more now that im only working weekends and starting school next week rather then working 40+ hours a week so maybe i can catch him and actually talk to him a bit.
