<p>Here it was that every teenager "ultra" suddenly wanted to be a "casual" and everyone was buying these expensive English clothes that English hooligans wear. I mean for us they're relatively expensive. It was funny because English wear these clothes to stay unnoticed, but if you were wearing Stone Island here you were like one of 4 people in the city who had SI jacket and you stuck out of the crowd immediately. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> It was good though because fans started to dress good and look normal, before that our terraces were full of junkies with bomber jackets and similar bums, many of them were leftist never-do-wells. With this casual subculture neo-Nazi element became stronger.</p>

<p>The part I liked the most in the movie was the away game in Liverpool, when they're on the bus. If you've ever been to an away game with hooligan nutters, you can just feel it. Away games are the best part of football fan subculture. Booze, drugs, travelling to some shithole just to see a random football game... In every group you have some "comedians" and "legends" who make everyone laugh on the bus, and there will always be some random guy totally drunk talking stupid things. We had sort of hierarchy on the bus, tough guys ("first team") at the back, junkies and drunkards in the middle, and in the front were older and normal guys who were talking about football bets during the whole trip. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> The scene when those two punks steal in the gas station in FF... We had one completely kleptomanic guy who had no balls for fighting but the biggest balls for stealing stuff in gas station shops, he'd always come out with shitload of stuff no matter what. In most cases though, 30-40 people would just storm the shop like niggers and steal sandwiches and beers. I have millions of good memories from away games, the best ones are when we were going with a van, 8-9 people, only the inner circle of our crew. Didn't matter if we went to a village 2 hours away or to another country, it was always a whole day of fun and crazy shit, sometimes a whole weekend, especially if we went to seaside. You probably have similar stories.</p>

<p>Maybe you'll like this movie, it's the Russian version of FF. Everyone here liked it, actual hooligans participated in the movie and it's about Spartak hools who are neo-Nazis.</p>
