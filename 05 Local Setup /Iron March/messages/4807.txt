<p>The Folkish state is necessarily statist as far as social and cultural matters are concerned, but not necessarily so in other areas, that's for individual nations to decide. It demands of its folk (there is no citizenship, merely the tribe), a social contract that ensures they participate in cultural matters, uphold the values of the ancestors, and recognise that their minds and bodies are the property of the folk at large; our lives are not merely our own.</p>
<p>Cosmopolitanism is a plague, and I feel that Germanic peoples in particular struggle with city-life. The Anglo-Saxons were actually afraid of former Roman towns and cities, because they knew what they did to communities. So I do favor smaller, and tighter, communities which have a connection to the land. City planning should always ensure to create as many gardens and parks as possible to aid in this.</p>
