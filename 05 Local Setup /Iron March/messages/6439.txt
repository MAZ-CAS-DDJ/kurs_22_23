<p>Wow. I have a lot of reading to do. Thanks for the suggestions. I have heard of  <span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:11.818181991577148px;">Pentti Linkola but that's about it. I am very new to fascist thought (still not even sure if I am a fascist) and so have not done much reading on the subject.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:11.818181991577148px;">I agree with what you said about maintaining 'human biodiversity'.  But I still do not think that any race is superior to another.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:11.818181991577148px;">What are your opinions on green anarchy? Previously I could not understand how we could possibly hope to save and protect the environment without a totalitarian or fascist state. People cannot be trusted to look after the environment of their own volition. But I still have many anarchist sympathies, and I was thinking that if the capitalist/industrial state was destroyed and anarchy put in place. Then mass production could no longer function, as centralised organisation has been destroyed, and the strains on the environment could be lessened? Just a thought. I still think that fascism is a much safer and practical approach to dealing with the environmental crisis. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:11.818181991577148px;">What are your opinions on vegetarianism and veganism?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:11.818181991577148px;">Also, how would you describe your perfect fascist state?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:11.818181991577148px;">Is fascism, in your mind, synonmous with suppressing the free will of the people? Is brainwashing essential? (I am quite opposed to such practices.) </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.818181991577148px;">Finally, what do you mean by 'naming the Jew'?. What exactly is it about the Jewish race that is such a problem, from an ecofascist perspective?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:11.818181991577148px;">Sorry for all the questions, but I am very curious, as I am so new to fascism, what ideological ideas are out there.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:tahoma, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:11.818181991577148px;">Thanks again for the reading list. I will try and get through as much as I can. </span></p>
