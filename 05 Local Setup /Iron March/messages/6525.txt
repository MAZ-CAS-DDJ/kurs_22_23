<p>Greetings Aleksandr! </p>
<p>I wanted to know if you could help me with my Russian. Maybe lend a few tips? My family never had the chance to teach me.</p>
<p>But so far I have been learning the language on and off for years. I just never had proper help. I can read Russian Cyrillic fluently, but I don't know what the words mean. Writing is a whole different story as well but I think if I can get vocabulary down in my mind writing should come with ease? </p>
<p>Any help is appreciated. </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bogatyr</p>
