			Yes, I know it is my own fault as broken man, and I try to find ways to 'heal' myself, but I often hit the ground anyway. I don't know what is the root of the problem, and so I cannot fix it. The more I study, the more cynical and skeptic I become.

			I don't know how to explain the differences between the Truth and reality well, so I ask you to excuse me. It's something that I often meditate about, both in thoughts and words, but living the daily life it seems that reality is just a prison after all, a product of our own construct and environment.

	If you lie to someone, that lie becomes a reality, but it will never have Truth. Realities can be hollow, without any inner essence, and in our dark era the essence is withdrawing; that's why we have to be persistent in our efforts to get to it.
