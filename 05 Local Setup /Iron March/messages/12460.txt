<p>Most of our christians don't understand the situation but lean towards European side. The ones who are real christians and who practice the faith sure are against invasion though. Church of England is crazy, women priests is so bad!</p>
<p>Usa is so big that i don't know about most, my area is very iberal and posioned, but those who still hold the faith stand against the invasion. The south is very against it, Muslims know to stay out of the south</p>
