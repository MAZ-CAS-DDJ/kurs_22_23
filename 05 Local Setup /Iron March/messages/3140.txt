<p>concerning the public interactive archive, im really interested in the idea. Although i dont have a way to send money at the moment, i will sort something out and at Christmas i might be able to send 50 euros if everything go ok. </p>
<p>But i have an other concern as well. What would you say if you could make this archive multi-lingual? Meaning have afilliations with foreign language versions of the project. Im thinking of doing something of the sort for the sake of Golden Dawn, as an extension of the social work and the ideological indoctrination of our members!</p>
