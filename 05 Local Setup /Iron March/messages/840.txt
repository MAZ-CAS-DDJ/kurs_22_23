A multipolar world where Atlantic nations get back in touch with their European heritage? Marvelous. A multipolar world where tiny racial communes do what Moscow or Berlin tells them? As a nationalist I don't think so.</div></blockquote>
<p>I envy then that you have a nation established you already have feelings for. I don't think they would be "communes" I think over a period of time individual nations would start to appear the on the continent. I also don't imagine that it it would be a "do what we tell you to do or else" type scenario that the Wiki article gave off. From my talks with NR and such I would imagine it would look more like the relationship the Soviet Union had with Cuba, with Cuba being the smaller dependent nation and relying on the Soviets but still maintaining its ability to make decisions and autonomy. </p>
