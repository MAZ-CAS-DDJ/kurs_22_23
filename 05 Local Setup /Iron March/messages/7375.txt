<p>to avoid hijacking your thread, I'm going to make this statement to you privately. you'll have to forgive me for some measure of ignoring or even being completely blind to details that I don't think matter much, I'll illustrate what I mean. take vlad and his aryanism for example. I don't consider myself an aryanist, yet I believe vlad and I fundamentally agree, and I also believe you and vlad fundamentally agree. how can this be with the difference in narrative? when someone speaks, is the meaning contained in the speaker, the words being spoken, or the understanding of the listener? the answer is all and none of those, and there is an answer. since you've been on the path for a while I expect that you understand palpably what I am talking about. to give another example, let's say we have a young couple venturing into an abandoned house said to be haunted by a ghost that aggressively keeps people away. the male is skeptical of the paranormal and the female is a staunch believer. they walk in, and immediately, a beam crashes in front of them. they both decide it's too dangerous to venture in and immediately leave. the male explains that the house was likely structurally weakened and that it was a coincidence. the female says the ghost pushed it at them. who's right? how would you know the difference? perhaps the house to a degree happened to be structurally weakened in that specific way specifically because they would enter at that specific moment. how would you know? is this subjectivity? it isn't, because if you look at it from Truth's domain, you will see nothing but Truth.</p>

<p>now understand what I am saying in the context of that concept I have illustrated. the more you try to nail down the disagreement, the more subtly elusive it will become.</p>
