	Eh, same old same old getting closer to the end of the semester so I always tend to be a little more stressed during this time, with all of the papers coming up all at once. So anyways since I am mostly ignorant about paganism some of my questions my be pretty stupid, so let me apologize in advance. So do you actively worship a certain deity? Do you just choose which one to worship? Also, is rune reading a real thing or it just wiccan faggotry? I saw one time when I was goofing around in the app store on my that there were some "rune" apps but it seemed more like a horoscope kind of thing is that right? Also, no I did not get the app. Anyways, sorry for all the stupid questions. Let me know if you get this.Â
