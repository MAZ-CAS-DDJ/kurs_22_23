<p>Dear Alex,</p>
<p>How radiant you are my guardian angel, my valkyrie. I feel as though my entire life has been leading up to meeting you. Each post you make is poetry to me and I hang on every word. I must confess that your witty retorts had me tipping my fedora affectionately at my computer monitor so often that my classy headgear is now coated in a significant layer of dorito dust. But alas such starstruck young lovers such as ourselves care not for such trivial matters as wasted gamer fuel and instead eagerly await the day that we may passionately meet and throw ourselves recklessly into each other's arms.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>P.S. you should add my friend Joe on FB he is a pretty cool guy.</p>
