<p>Because I am confrontational and go against the beliefs of most on here. Namely I am not racist, vehemently anti-capitalist, objective/logical, and globalist in scope. My signature is meant to piss them off, I don't particularly care either way about Jews and I do absolutely believe in race as a biological reality (just not a political one). But for some reason I get called a Jew, a leftist, anti-fascist, race traitor, etc. They just have no means of ideologically countering what I say so they resort to ad hominems.</p>
