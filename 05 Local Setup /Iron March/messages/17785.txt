	Chaos is based on Discordism and edgy style Satanism. <br />
	They were artificial extra dimensional entities that exist only because Ancient Space Lizards fucked up the Warp.<br />
	The C'tan have a better right to divinity than the Chaos "Gods". <br />
	Also the Emperor was born in Anatolia, thousand of years before the Turks and if he were to die he will become a God in the Warp considering how belief works in 40k.
