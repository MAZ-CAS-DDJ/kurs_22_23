<p>As a matter of fact the name that striked me was Hristache. It is a common surname here and for fact surnames ending with -aki can be traced in Crete mostly (where no aromanians exist) and other areas as well. But that particular person was a Romanian as i assume. So as a matter of fact, it was the lack of evidence that drove me to ask, rather some indications of it, which most likely dont lead anywhere.</p>
