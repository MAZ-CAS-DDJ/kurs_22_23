<p>Wilco re the fb group page.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Name suggestions?  Include "American Blackshirts" in the name but it needs to be a variant and, do we include NBU in the title?  I think not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will add you to the group along with myself as Admin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Do we have it as a "Closed Group", visible in name searches on fb, along with members and what we're about or, as a "Secret Group" which does not show up in searches on fb and is as secret as one can possibly imagine (on fb and the Internet)?  I think "Closed" if preferable if it is to be used as a general recruiting tool.  Comment?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will put something in the "About" section with an over-view of the group and ask you to comment on appropriateness et cetera.</p>
