I apologize for not making it on time again. However, from the looks of things, no one else came so you're right. Kind of a failure all around.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>And I, in turn, missed your message. Pro Patria Mori said we should have tried for the weekend, but I don't know. Should we adjourn to the IRC now? Hope the issue was resolved, btw.</p>
