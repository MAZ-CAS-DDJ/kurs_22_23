<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>Just letting you know I petitioned Slavros &amp; there's now an Australia &amp; New Zealand subforum in the 'Fascism by Country' section. Would be great if we got it active- I've got a couple threads lined up to throw in there this week. Plus, Slavros warned it'd be shitcanned if we didn't make good use of it. So if you have any material you've had lying around- post!</p>
<p>Cheers, hope your Aussie Day was good.</p>
