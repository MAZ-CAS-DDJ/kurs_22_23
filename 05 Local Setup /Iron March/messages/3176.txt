<p>The nordic model as in a social democratic wonderland? ''Folkhemmet''?</p>
<p>I don't really dislike the idea of it, in fact I praise it. To an extent, of course.</p>
<p>Right now Sweden is having a massive immigration combined with a mindset that ''everyone who is against this immigration and multi culture is a racist''. I think this is scary, our values that make Sweden what it is is being destroyed. Our society is polluted with extreme feminism and the fear of offending every single little minority that exists. Meanwhile we have a huge influx of negroids and arabs too who gets a huge welfare check for doing nothig. They don't even have to learn Swedish. I can't summ up this problem in just a few sentances, you wont truely understand untill you see a Swedish politician making a rapist into a victem and the real victem into a racist. I am not joking there, sadly.</p>
<p>Now. I am not against welfare programs, In fact, I support them. However I believe that people need to fail and face the consequences. They should not starve, of course. I consider a roof over every Swede's head and food on his or her table as a sort of minimum standard.</p>

<p>Oh okay.  On the immigration and destruction of culture and race, I have to disagree, but do understand it perfectly.   The feminists and the minorities, I perfectly understand, sometimes I believe people are overly sensitive.  Specially before I was into learning about politics, I used to believe that some people abused the hate crime laws, and that there should be equal hate crime laws against the rich and whites, and that too many people use this as an excuse.  I am and have always been against affirmative action, as it is reverse racism, and believed more that it usually isn't a hate crime, but it was just coincidence that the person you killed is black ( I might have been to naive and non-racist though, and believed that everyone was the same, but oh well).   I want equality for them, but I don't want to champion them, as that would be reverse racism and sexism just as well. </p>
<p>I do like what you said about the welfare programs, and I do think the basic necessities for living and for succeeding in live (food, water, house, education, electricity) should be accessible to everyone ( I lived in Mexico for a while, lack of welfare sucks).</p>
