<p>'Tis a shame that pagan has become synonymous with hippy dippy new age libs, rather than the positive values of pre-Christian Indo-European societies.</p>
<p>But anyway, I would definitely go if not for that 4 hour driving issue. Perhaps you should make a skype account if you don't have one and add me.</p>

<p>Eh, as long as they're sincere in their religious beliefs I generally have no problem with most other pagans. Followers of the Religio tend to be more conservative however, so I'm in luck. What really irks me is the folks who try to bend their religion to their politics or vice-versa. Wiccans do that a lot, but a lot of "Traditionalist" pagans who think Evola was the greatest thing ever also irritate me.</p>
<p>Skype makes me cringe to be honest. I tried to download it in order to secure a commission from Kacen, aand it was a horrid mess. Screwed up my image quality for weeks. Perhaps we could chat via telephone. I don't believe Hampton qualifies as long-distance, so it would be convenient for me at least.</p>
