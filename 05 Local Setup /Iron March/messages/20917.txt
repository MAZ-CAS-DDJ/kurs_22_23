	<strong>"Lower Silesia" is not "Silesia". Very importnant. </strong>
</p>

	I am from "woj. dolnośląskie" what mean "province Lower Silesia" and my region is somethinkg... ok i am from Lower Silesia and is good. Nothink more, nothink special, when I tell someone about me I tell my name, surname, name of town and country. If someone ask about province I tell it, I like my province, but... This is not a strong bond. More people think this same in my country. Maybe because sometimes province was created for no resons. Example Opolskie province is shit... This province should don't exist. No resons, low culture, low history bond. 
</p>

<p>
	Silesian province have the biggest reson to exist and people from this province have the most different culture, speech, economy, worldview from the rest of the Poles. Sometimes when ask "From are you?" they say "I am from Silesia from Poland". Other Poles on this same question say "I am from Poland from my town(Wroclaw)". Province for they is very important. 
</p>

<p>
	In my opinion they have regret to the rest of the country. At least the majority of Silesians consider themselves to be Silesian and Poles at the same time. Many people from Silesia was in the German army(because in Silesia during the second war we have many Germans and Silesian Poles were conscripted by force into the army). 
</p>

<p>
	A small group of Poles decided that Silesia was a hidden German option. (fuck Kaczyński, fuck this stupied people who say it).
</p>

<p>
	In my opinion Silesia is Poland. The times are a bit too separate(don't worry about it, it is okey I living with one of them :D). When I talk with them I think I talk with person who is 90% Poles and 10% Silesia when rest of people from country is like 100% Poles. 
</p>

<p>
	Today 50% people is not specifically identified as a separate nation or more important region. 49% people identified as a Poles and Silesia and 1% think they are separate nation (99% dislike this 1%).

<p>
	Ah... this is very hard describe. General people from Silesa thinking more about province, person who called people from Silesa as another nation is stupid. Silesa is a part of Poland and Poland without Silesa is not this same Poland.

	Silesian band what created song in the Silesian dialect. I understand 100% this same words or words like "JO CHCA" what mean "Ja Chce" is mean "I want". Less like 10% people from Silesia using this dialect or sometimes on for a few things. Yes inspired by rammstein XD
