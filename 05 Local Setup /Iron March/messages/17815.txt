	Hey man what area area of the state are you from?  I live in Little Rock.  I've kinda helped draw together a small network lately on zogbook and daily stormer, but they're they're mostly aut right, run of the mill WN, as far as I can tell.  Several other Arkansans have joined here briefly in the last year but I dont think they have been back.
