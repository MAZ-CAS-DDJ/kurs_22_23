	I don't recall hearing from you. I'm just joining the Army, after this summer. I seriously can't function in society. I'm going to end up on the streets. You must've been Mr.K, though. (I'm not trying to spell THAT) You might consider joining up with Werwolf Nexion, if they are still active. They were fighting in Ukraine a few years ago. I can't Imagine that Kristoph got a job, not involving soldiering. You know who Kristoph is, right? Did Rape ever get into contact with him?
