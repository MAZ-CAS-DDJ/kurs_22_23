<p>This is off topic of fitness goals, basically I've made a friend of mine a fascist not too long ago.  Because of that he ask me a lot of questions about our worldview and for the most part I've answered them pretty well.  He's brought up that some sources claim that homosexuals are just as capable as heterosexuals when raising children.  I've seen other sources that say otherwise and understand that just because a couple fringe homos may be able to raise kids well does not mean they as a whole should allowed access to children.  But I'm having a difficult time putting my thoughts together to make a good response.  What am I missing here? </p>
