<p>Hello, I see you are on the forum. There are some threads on current projects but most of it swamped in discussions and history over the past 2 years. The main topic we have is the one titled 'the resource', which is where I discuss essays for the journal. Though all the information is on there I will lay it out simply</p>
<p>A) adapting a posted article or the arguments of one into a new essay</p>
<p><img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_cool.png" alt="B)"> Following the instructions of a given post</p>
<p>C) Researching a topic to write on</p>
<p>D) I need people to keep a sharp eye for anything that might be relevant, eg parts of a manifesto we can use in the policy section, somehting on organisation for the guide, etc. Also I highly prize finding filler material - slogans, ideas, poems, speeches ect, that embody a good concept.</p>
<p>Currently I have most people on something,</p>
<p>Social credit, Securitization, whatever peter and mierce are doing. though I have not spoken to Simon or Cmyrru for a while. Jamie M just left because he says he is no longer (probably never was) a fascist, and incidently was also asked to help - those who complain the loudest. I despise the passive aggressive. it all looks like it is coming along nicely but I have like these 3 other people, pretty new who don't seem to be responding well, though they of course may all be busy.</p>
<p>As someone who is objective and a reliable forum member I would appriciate feedback.</p>
<p>I am going to do some more prodding.</p>
