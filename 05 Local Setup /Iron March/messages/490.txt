<p>The primary organ of the state would be syndicalist/corporatist. Essentially the industries will become the new federal government, there will be three types which will all be organized differently: agriculture, manufacturing and service. The primary weight should be put on the manufacturing, and fundamentally they will not be equal since they are not entities in themselves, merely methods of organizing the syndicate, for example, the agricultural syndicate will be highly decentralized and run on private initiative, whereas much of the production should be run top-down, with a lot of central planning. The state and the national economy will therefore effectively have been merged. Workers will be able to effectively elect their own bosses from a board of the most educated and qualified from the position, these should have a mandate for a number of years to do effectively whatever they want verying by the sort of industry, with the exception of course of firing workers- this will require review and regulation. There will be a few spheres where business is regulated, but as long as individual units or cells meet the expectations and requirements of their higher-ups ergo, the state (which shouldn't compromise the entirety of their business: the rest of their time can be dedicated to private enterprise) they are free to go about business as they see fit. Of course if they require assistance or subsidy for this business they must be capable of returning it.</p>
<p>Anyway the directors and organizers from a selected industry (say shipbuilding or coal mining for example) will elect the leaders of an industry, the leaders of an industry will send representatives to the government. The matters of the state should enclose primarily economic and cultural matters. The state will have of course special boards, committees and administrations, these however will be selected by and given mandate by the primary body. This congress should have a small executive committee to settle and regulate its disputes, however, no one leader can take upon the responsibility of leading the state. I imagine it would be made up of five people, all with specific fields where they organize. One for example would have the foreign policy and diplomacy, another would have the armed forces etc (obviously there would be an administration of some sort to help each of them.) However while the central congress is elected by the syndicates, the executive committee will be elected by the vote holders, so will other high offices, like special committees and boards. Municipal or local authorities should be elected by all citizens, but they can be swapped by the central congress. Local judiciaries are selected by municipal authorities. The supreme court should be selected directly by the syndicate directors who also elect the central congress. Immigrants in the process of naturalization or people who's citizenship is under question (criminals) do not hold any voting power whatsoever. Ordinary citizens only hold the vote within their syndicate or labor. No political organizations of any type are allowed whatsoever.</p>

<p>Service in the armed forces for over five years. Service as a state mandated worker (which should be specifically difficult labor that is expensive to hire privately) for ten years. Service in non-mandated work for twenty years or service in distinction. Mothers who have more than three children and form a stable, functional family. A criminal record can complicate any of these, so can a divorce, and other mishaps: like being fired, especially considering this shouldn't be something easily done.</p>
<p>Note though, all the privileges both given and taken from these voters that I talked about in the above paragraphs. These must pay higher taxes than the average joe (except of course the women). They retire later. They are also given special requirements, like more military/civil preparatory training so that they can organize in the event of a crisis.</p>
<p>However only they can serve in an officer's rank, only they can hold economic office, only they can elect upper authorities. This way, the power of the state is not only decentralized but the responsibilities are centralized, with republican accountability flowing through the whole state. At best, hopefully the higher citizens should make up 10-20% of the population. This means a dedicated and politically aware core of citizens that call the real shots- they know how valuable their powers are because they fought and worked hard to obtain them. Others are also represented. protected and have rights- but the bottom line is that the people with the power will be your neighbor, everyone will know many of them. They'll be community leaders, and everyone will aspire to them, because these will be people that have served their country, and continue to serve. Of course there may be a few idiots, but these will be loyal, hard working idiots.</p>
