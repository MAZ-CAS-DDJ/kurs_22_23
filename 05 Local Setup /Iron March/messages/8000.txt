My knowledge of knife fighting is limited to the stances, the grips and the "distract and run if you can" rules, on the street would translate into throwing loose change or your wallet at their face.</p>

KM is impractical and creates a fantasist mindset for most people who learn it which can be dangerous - I'd only put it slightly higher than karate. Muay Thai is something I've heard good things about, my friend here wants me to start going.</p>

My main martial arts is limited to boxing and wrestling. I put boxing on the same level as jousting, only less bloody; it certainly prepares you to the same extent that boxing does, I'd imagine.</p>
