<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>We have to start somewhere, even with just a handful of us. I'll try my best to compile some material for the Irish section over the next while, without neglecting the rest of the forum of course. Unfortunately these days though there aren't many Irish sources of material. There used to be  few blogs etc that I would comment on occasionally. Most of these have closed down now unfortunately. Are you familiar with former blogs such as Hibernia Girl, The Irish Bulletin and Corrupt Ã‰ire? I used to follow them before they shut down.</p>
