	Sorry for taking a while to respond, I understand your concern. I don't believe in biological determinism, and most traditional worldviews that were not totally fatalistic did not either. Rather they say a synthesis of the flesh and the spirit as the factors which influenced behaviour and nature. Israel, the chosen people of God, was always at it's core a spiritual covenant, we see this explained in the writings of Paul, James, etc. The Old Covenant was in the blood of the children of Abraham, who were consistently really shitty despite having every advantage from God, the New Covenant is in the spirit of Abraham, the Holy Spirit, which we shall know by it's fruits. A kike is known through his actions and his fruit.
