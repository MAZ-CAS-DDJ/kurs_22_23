<p>I apologise for being idle for so long and not replying sooner, my laptop had problems. America itself, it's foundations and culture are all inheritedly Anglo-Saxon. As well as the majority of its Whites. The only way, I feel to truly restore America would be to return to complete Anglo Saxon Protestantt dominance, the people who built America. Its biggest mistake was letting in so many European ethnicities in and diluting its unique English way of life. The influx of so many immigrants is when the decline began. However, yes I also loathe this modern society,  riddled in all of its degeneracy, debauchery, and materialism. And I also am disillusioned with American "values" and "freedom". When I think of America, honestly, I think of coca cola, McDonalds, Hollywood, Porn, and Hip Hop. I think it's amazing how so many soldiers are willing to die for such a wretched entity. Through my life I have been forced to assume a culture, a history, and a way of life that are not mine, not to mention I am very different ethnically than most Whites, few of whom can pronouce my name. My loyalty now lies with my homeland, Denmark, and my true brethren by blood.  </p>
<p>Wow, ironically, I myself live just outside of las Vegas, so I also know decadence and immorality quite well.</p>
