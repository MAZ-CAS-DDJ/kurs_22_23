	Slaw! Choni/Çawanî? Soranî yan Kurmancî?

	So since I'm not sure if you speak Sorani or Kurmanci (I speak Sorani by the way), I'll stay with English for now. Anyway, this is actually the first time I've met another Kurd who has openly admitted (to himself) that he's a fascist. Most other Kurds have semi-fascist tendencies, but I find that they never admit it out loud, and they never take their views all the way to the natural and necessary conclusions of what we need to do in order to save Kurdistan. So that's why I was really glad when I read your posts/introduction, since we agree on almost everything (and I really mean everything), and the few tiny areas where we don't agree on can be ironed out in order to form a clearer and fuller vision of Kurdish Fascism as a whole.

	Personally, I'm already starting to get involved in spreading National Socialism among Kurds through various outlets. I currently live in the US (and I think you live in the Netherlands?), so my plan is to go back and forth between Kurdistan and the US for now—between studying in the US and at the same time gradually building up a fascist Kurdish community back home. You and I really need to join forces and work together, since Kurds like us (who know and understand fascism already) are really rare. Simply discussing the massive issues facing our nation and race would go a long way in formulating a clear and final Weltanschauung (which Kurds currently lack), and then working together to gradually build up the movement and implement the necessary societal changes would be a dream come true.

	Anyway, I didn't want this introductory message to be too long, so I'll cut it short here. Looking forward to hear from ya. Take care, buddy!
