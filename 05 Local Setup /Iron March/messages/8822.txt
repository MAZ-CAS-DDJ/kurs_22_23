<p>Right! I like PMs, feels more like I'm writing a letter.</p>

<p>Yes, or at least my mother knows, since I live with her. Haven't seen my father for years, since before I was a fascist. I made a post about this some weeks ago? My mother is the most obnoxious of 60's retreads. <em>Far out, man.</em> Thing is, she has already gone through the shock period years ago when I first started being a racist bastard. Like I think I wrote in the post, I'm of the age now that she's given up on me. I've started to influence her though, in a bizarre way. The tldr version is that I've totally redpilled her on the nature of the jews, but that is it. For some reason, she latched onto jew hate easily after just a couple of holocaust and David Duke videos, and a copy of the protocols. I think <em>muh palestine</em> is a good gateway drug for hippies to get into antisemitism. Apart from that she is an intense anti-racist liberal shill. Actually she's kind of like an american libertarian now. She spends all her time online harassing people about muh freedoms and getting further and further into anti-state conspiracies starting with jews and ending up in aliens.</p>

<p>How about your parents, lass? Oh, and do you mind if I call you lass? Would you rather Ida? Or Ms. Radic?</p>

<p>What is your other non-croat half, by the way?</p>

<p>How do you feel about black metal? This has been my favourite song (at least in the genre) for a long time. Oldschool Russian style. You need to get yourself in the right atmosphere first though, imagine you are deep in a forest, among ancient firs. Its night, you can't see or feel anything but the piercing wind and the snow landing on your face.</p>

<p>My overall favourite song must be Moscow nights, and this is my favourite version.</p>
