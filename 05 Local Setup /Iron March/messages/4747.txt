<p>Israelites (whites - our descendents) are predestined - not Jews (Edomite/Kenite/Canaanite/Khazar mongrels [or mamzers in hebrew]), but non-whites still have souls and were created by God, but they do not have Adam as an ancestor. These people are actually destined for destruction (the entire book of Obadiah for a start tells this). <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Scripture only foretells the destruction of a particular breed: the Canaanite, Edomite breed</span></span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">. (Gen. 3:15, Zech. 14:21, Romans 16:20).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Jews as we know them today are indeed a sub-species hybrid. </span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">But this does not mean that the other races will be exterminated</span></span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">. On the contrary, the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah show that the pure-blooded Israelites of the House of Judah had no intention of killing of their forbidden offspring. Neither one of these priest-kings demanded their extermination. </span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Instead, the House of Judah was advised to spurn their company and were forbidden by those two law-abiding priests from further engaging in race-mixing</span></span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Needless to say </span></span>the groups we know them as today went on to split into Sephardim (Edomite/Kenite/canaanite descended w/ negroid and mongoloid admixture) and Ashkenazim (Edomite/Kenite/Canaanite descended with Khazar-mongoloid and European input). Any geneticist or study can tell you that Jews are the most outbred group in the world today, which is why they have so many specific genetic diseases only found amongst Jews or people with Jewish ancestry by unlucky chance of genetic recombination.</p>

<p>Those two links have some good background on them, it helps put everything into perspective a lot more. It's a known fact that "Indo-Euopeans" can trace their ancestry to the Middle East first and then into Europe later.</p>
<p>Here I've discussed the "Jews" some more:</p>

<p>Besides the Israelites were described as Ruddy:</p>

<p>Infact <a href="http://www.htmlbible.com/sacrednamebiblecom/kjvstrongs/STRHEB1.htm#S119" rel="external nofollow">here is what Adam</a> means. It would be silly to give this name if it wasn't a descriptive name.</p>
<p>Only whites can blush and show red in the face. Of course, mongrels with significant white ancestry and light skin can too, but that wasn't in accordance to God's plan right from the beginning of "kind after kind". Modern Jews hardly fit thse descriptions and depictions, they are infact swarthy, kinky haired, rubber lipped, hook nosed, slimy, pathetic looking and they are the biggest mongrels (mamzers) out. Sure there may be SOME religious jews of Israelite stock, but most are not.</p>
<p>Red pilling christians about Jews (who they are and what they do) is the easiest thing because it's all in the bible to begin with.</p>

<p>and then you just point out their evil deeds they're doing today and their control of everything (MacDonald's culture of critique is a good recommendation) and it falls into place with them. All of my friends and family hate Jews now and most of them dislike niggers too, they already hated Pakis from the start though.</p>
<p>As for niggers, my personal opinion is that most niggers are utterly depraved to a much lower level than us that I barely have anything to do with them and think any and all efforts to try and save them is futile and is quite frankly a waste of my time, they are utterly hopeless, even more so since the fire has been stoked by Jewish agitators. Altruism and chivalry is a meaningless concept to the nigger with "freedom".</p>

<p>This is why every single nigger should be left to starve, you can only take so much chivalry being thrown back in your face. You try to do something good for one and then another comes in and kills you.</p>
<p>However here is what's specifically taught by the bible.</p>
<p>I know many racialists have probably read Erectus walks amongst us and of course there's a lot of speculation and interpretation through an evolutionary scope, but that is not to say there is no truth to the book at all, especially with regards to genetic distance, primitive traits and genetic recombination; not to mention the last few chapters of the book dealing with social policies.</p>

<p><a href="http://erectuswalksamongst.us/" rel="external nofollow">http://erectuswalksamongst.us/</a>Chap28.html</p>
<p>This chapter in particular is what I want to raise with the people I'm sending this message out to. It seems the bible YET AGAIN has beaten the "evolutionists" and scientists to the punch with regards to taxonomy and wisdom with regards to being able to mix with species. The bible regards blacks as beasts, but it's only Christian Identity whom point this out; even kinists dance around this obvious issue, just choosing to ignore the points raised and which can be checked in the bible for themselves. Pastor Butler and Bertrand L. Comparet have dealt with this question in detail:</p>

<p>However, Pastor Allan Campbell does this research much more justice in the following sermon which I highly recommend you all to listen to, he touches on some small but very significant issues which both Butler and Comparet have missed, especially in regards to Exodus. He really puts it all into perspective, even teaching that these beasts do have souls and can be saved, but they have their different duties and positions and are not to be mixed with (as we all know if we've read the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, not to mention the command in Deuteronomy 23:2).</p>

<p>So where do we come from? The simple answer is Adam. Genesis 1:26-28 and Genesis 2:7-8 seems to suggest that God took Adam from an ALREADY CREATED white race (Genesis 1:26-28) in order to mold Adam in to a higher being of that race (Genesis 2:7-8). I believe that Adam was taken from the people we now know of as the Cro-Magnons. I find this explanation to be very plausible and keeping with undeniable scientific and historic evidence (no extra theories thrown in like evolution, just the raw hard data of the skulls). A similar position and some interesting food for thought concerning this has been posted here:</p>

<p>This link does great justice in clearing up all matters in regards to salvation of non-white people if non of the others did:</p>

<p>Distinguishing between beasts (quadruped) and beasts (biped) presents us a great deal of truth. If this truth were more widely known I think it would stop the mad race towards mongrelization and stop the mindset of egalitarianism dead in its tracks in the mind of most people.</p>
<p>I'm preaching to the converted but I feel it is good to hammer the nail in a little bit further for extra security.</p>
<p>The point is all can be saved by Christ, many won't allow themselves to, yet we are to remain with our own kind and not mix.</p>
