<p>have you been able to come across any other online versions of Codreanus book, 'to my legionaries" where the text isn't run together? Eh, then again I suppose you'd post it you found one.</p>
<p>Also, I remember reading somewhere you are a fan of punk rock, or were.</p>
<p>I just want to point out that GG Allin is the epitomy of the genre and the shining light that humanity needs to reddem itself culturally XD</p>
<p>Of course I'm joking...</p>
<p>maybe..</p>

<p>Hey there, no, unfortunately this is the only version of Codreanu's book I found online.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm a punk rock fan, but never saw GG Alin as a shining light, LOL!</p>
<p>Hails, WiB</p>
