I was reading that Neil Strauss shit when I was fucking 15, lmao, well I was into a lot of stupid, dangerous and idiotic stuff when I was that age but you learn from it. Even then I couldn't help but feel depressed at the dishonesty and sleaziness when <em>The Game</em>.</p>
<p>As far as churches go, I'm a protestant, I go to a Presbyterian church a few miles away from where I actually live. As far as churches go, it doesn't matter an awful lot, as I touched a little bit in the theonomy thread in this post:</p>

<p>The earliest Christians of the bible used to meet and worship in homes. It is good if you can find a good church with like minded people as I have though. As I get older I'd probably consider becoming a minister once I've learnt enough; if the funds allow I'd have my own church built. Who knows what the future holds though; I jsut do my part and do what I know's right, I wish other people would but I don't hold out, you can't, playing the obsessed with politics an revolution game gets depressing and alienating. Anyway, chat soon man, gotta go pick my kid up from school.</p>
