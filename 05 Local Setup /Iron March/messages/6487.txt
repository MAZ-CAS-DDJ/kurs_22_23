<p>Well, I suppose on the issue of the Holy Spirit I would disagree with Arius, personally leaning more towards the Witnesses interpretation of it - that it is the creative force or energy of God and not a separate identity or being. This is in my opinion compatible with trinitydelusion's assertion that the Spirit is God himself. I suppose Arius really didn't focus too much on this area, however, due to the circumstances of the debates he was waging; the trinitarians and binitarians were mostly focusing on the role played by the Son in relation to the Father, with the HS being somewhat of an afterthought. In any event, I still view Arius as a theological conservative preserving the original Church in a more orthodox form against paganistic innovation.</p>

<p>As for Christ, I am studying more to try and ultimately decide between him being pre-existent to his human life (but created as a separate being by God, of course; being the Archangel Michael before and afterwards. This seems to be the leaning of both Arians and the Witnesses) or with Adoptionism, which seems to be what trinitydelusion leans towards, telling by the link.</p>

<p>Anyway, much more study needed for me. God bless.</p>
