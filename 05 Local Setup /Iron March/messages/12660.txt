<p>Well, like I said before I had a gift card so it didn't cost me anything. Yeah, it does suck that I made that mistake, but at least a have a great fiction book to read now. Although, that will be a while because after I finish Mein Kampf I'm going to read <em>The Outlaws </em>by Ernst von Salomon and then more than likely <em>The Metaphysics of War </em>by Julius Evola and then read this. Also, it is not the full novel it's only the first part, apparently there are at least two more volumes that will be released. So, with all that in mind I'll let you know what I think of it as soon as I can, although at this rate it may be some time in the summer tbh.</p>
