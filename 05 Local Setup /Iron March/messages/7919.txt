<p>True. In such a case, a confederation would be the best, and in my opinion, it would herald the birth of a new superpower. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, we could work on to establish a common language, and perhaps a common identity too.</p>
<p>However I see the proper involvement of Finland into such a union a distant possibility for now, as the lands where the Turks live are quite close to eachother, but the Finns are seperated by Muscowy. If such a union would be deemed desirable by the Finns, we'd have no qualms about going to war with Russia to cut a swathe to pyhsically bind those territories to the Urals, but as I said, most of these are mere dreams for now.</p>

<p>I tell you what I advocate for the more immidiate future. I believe that both Uralics and Altaics should seperately try to advocate closer relations within their own circles for now. Estonia is an immidiate neighbor of Finland. Finland should be as a big brother and aim to better the economic power and life standards in Estonia, while advocating similar programs in Finnic dominated areas within the Russian confederation, urging people to come to study in Finland and sending them back to act as the leaders of their respective communities.</p>
