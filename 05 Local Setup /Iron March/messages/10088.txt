<p>Nah but for real, I have a pretty complicated worldview but most of it is stuff you already know. I'm Germanic Pagan and that effects a large part of it, basically I view history as a wheel or swastika. It moves forward but there are always cycles and repeated themes. There is always a summer, winter, spring and fall although they may be radically different each year. I think that humans have a divine purpose and that we are the children of the gods, especially the races of Aryan descent. I believe that laws and society are divine and their origin is in the divine and that our enemies, who seek to destroy society and laws and dismiss them as "social constructs"....well, I am not sure what they are. Demonic, Satanic, dark cosmic powers of the universe whatever I don't care. I think they are unnatural and should be purged to move society forward. </p>
