<p>Yeah I like a hard print too, so that I dont hurt my eyes and can read from the bed, but I need to settle for pdfs because I dont have cash to spare on printing or buying shit right now. Sucks that you made that mistake, but I guess it turned out all Â right. Tell me what's the novel like once you're done</p>
