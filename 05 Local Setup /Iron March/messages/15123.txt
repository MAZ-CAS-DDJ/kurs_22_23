	I grew up in an atheist house with parents who were openly hostile to religion.   I agree about Hitler.  I find myself moving closer and closer to "1488".   He was pretty much right about everything.  Not only was he right but he was sincere.  At least that's what my instincts tell me.   He honestly cared about the well-being of his people.  He meant what he said and I think that's why he still resonates with people today.  He definitely resonates with me.  There was a beauty to National Socialism.  I appreciate the aesthetics and the sense of order.  Before I read Siege I read the Ford and Stalag translations of Mein Kampf.    Mein Kampf could have been written today.  Jews really don't change much.
