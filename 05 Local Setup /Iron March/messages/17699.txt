	I was reading up on Serb nationalism recently, and I was wondering what you would do with Macedonia,Â would you split it with Bulgaria? I heard there are also some Serb nationalists who want to incorporate parts of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania,Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia and Albania. What is your stance on that? Also, I'm curious, what do you think of Alexander Lukashenko?
