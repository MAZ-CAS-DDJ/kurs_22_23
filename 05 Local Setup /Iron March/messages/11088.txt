<p>Apparently ISIS' master plan is to trigger a nuclear holocaust that would kill millions - but its never explained how they are actually planning on achieving their goal. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3253789/Isis-planning-nuclear-holocaust-wipe-hundreds-millions-face-earth-claims-reporter-embedded-extremists.html" rel="external nofollow">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3253789/Isis-planning-nuclear-holocaust-wipe-hundreds-millions-face-earth-claims-reporter-embedded-extremists.html</a></p>
