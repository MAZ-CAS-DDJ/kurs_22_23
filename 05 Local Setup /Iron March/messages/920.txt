<p>Just wanted to say, I love the Lewis quote you have in your signature. Mere Christianity is a wonderful book and was a big part of my conversion back to Christianity. I wish more people would look at Christianity objectively and understand that it holds the framework for the ideal society, not only in this world, but the next.</p>
