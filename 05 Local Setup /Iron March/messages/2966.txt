<p>Sorry I took so long to respond. Anyway...</p>
<p>I have not heard of them, but then I suppose I have not extensively read half the nonsense on the Internet.</p>
<p>Also... Don't mind my current avatar. I like to mess with people. It makes things entertaining.</p>
<p>As for Sumerian/Akkadian origins... If you mean the Talmud, certainly current Jewish tradition is very different. However, it is the cultural basis of at least pre-Talmud Judaism. <a href="http://www.ijs.org.au/Origins-and-Early-History-of-Israel/default.aspx" rel="external nofollow">http://www.ijs.org.a...el/default.aspx</a> Indeed, the ethic of Judaism is tied to it as well. We do not have a true "hell" (in the Christian sense), and Gehenna or She'ol are not true equivalents. I see this as originating perhaps in the understanding that it is this current life, the life God gave us here and now, that we live for to make ourselves a blessing.</p>
<p>Depending how you look at it, it is a <a href="http://history-world.org/sumerian_and_akkadian_myths.htm" rel="external nofollow">mythological</a> foundation also. This is compatible with Judaism in that its presence among other cultures actually validates the truth within the Torah.</p>
<p><a href="http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/SumerianMyth.htm" rel="external nofollow">This is the Sumerian creation myth.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/enuma.html" rel="external nofollow">This is a more intact version, although less informative.</a></p>
<p>In my view, the connection (<a href="http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/lecture4b.html" rel="external nofollow">http://www.historygu.../lecture4b.html</a>) is a positive, because it is a source of nationalism for any people that will identify with Hebrew cultural values.</p>
<p>I don't know what kind of Judaism you emerge, but what is your opinion on such things as the Zohar, and the existence of more symbolic interpretations--sometimes in addition to literal interpretations--of the Torah?</p>
