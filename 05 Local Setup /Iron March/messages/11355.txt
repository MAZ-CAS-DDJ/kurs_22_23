<p>Hey Kalash,</p>
<p>This is Blackshirt 13 here. Sorry to bother you but, I have a question about a website link you posted a while back <a href="http://www.mussolini.net/en/" rel="external nofollow">http://www.mussolini.net/en/</a> . I was just wondering if they are reliable? Also, how do you even order from them? It looks like they want to you to send them a fax or something? Anyways, like I said sorry to bother you and please let me know if you get this.</p>
<p>Hail,</p>
