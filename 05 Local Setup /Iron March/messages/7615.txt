<p>Organized crime stuff was always popular here among fascists. Me and one of my fascist friends know Sopranos by heart. We just feel related to it in some way. Take this scene from Goodfellas for example:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD3y43cyddI" rel="external nofollow">this</a> is the scene I always felt related to the most, being part of a large crew that's known all over town and feared/despised and at the same time knows how to enjoy life. That scene feels just like walking into one of our bars. Obviously we're younger though and look more like sportsmen, but you get the point.</p>

<p>I don't watch much movies lately, I used to be a big fan of older American movies, like from the 50s and 60s.</p>

<p>Anyway, the thing I enjoy the most about being a fascist and being part of the scene is that you're simply different than the rest of the crowd. There's just something about your life that makes you much more interesting than your regular product of this society. Never forget about that. You can be hated and despised and whatever, but you definitely have an interesting and adventerous life, and even your enemies won't deny that. It's just this feeling of pride, I don't know. People talk about you, people know you... I could never live any other way. Looking back the biggest sacrifice I made is basically rejecting a "what could have been" type of scenario where I could have been a talented historian doing his homeworks and becoming some sort of respectable figure in society without wandering into all the shit I became part of. I don't know if I mentioned to you that I'm basically the most talented student from my generation on the university (I study history). Anyway, I was never interested in that.</p>

<p>What I learnt from this NS hooligan scene is to stand up and fight, this is just something this ideology and being part of the scene gives you, if you really believe in it. "There's no way back, so don't look back", as one of my favourite Italian RAC songs says. For example last few days when I was on the university I took a look at all those fat student faggots and liberals and I was just so glad that I had entirely different upbringing than them by being a fascist. Our scene and our ideology toughened me up, if I wanted I'd just beat the shit out of them, one by one. That's just how I am, perhaps if I'd never came in contact with fascism I'd be just like one of those boring regular students? Who knows.</p>

<p>So yeah, this life forms strong relationships, through time you feel closer to all fascist-minded people worldwide, more than to regular people from your country. You were surrounded with atheists and feminists as you said but you were true to your principles so you definitely have your own interesting story to tell. Especially because modern world has specifically targeted women to brainwash them to stay away from "traditionalistic" principles. I think the biggest mistake people make about patriarchy and people with patriarchical mentality is that they think we somehow understimate women or whatever but in reality patriarchical values have always been more concerned about men - it's a set of principles how a man should behave; for example I'd never let my daugther (if I ever have one) or some other female relative be submissive to some idiot untermensch degenerate, just because she's a woman. When I wasn't outside with my crew I'd always rather talk to women because most "men" today are simply faggots and they disgust me. So there goes their theory. The strongest women (in terms of character) I ever met were Catholic traditionalistic women. I always like to remember my grandmother, a tough and arrogant (in a good way) Catholic woman, I like to think how she'd be proud of me right now because I kept my Catholic faith.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YwT-MtoYxo" rel="external nofollow">Here</a>'s something you might like, it's a Serb song, some Serb girl I was with liked this one a lot. As I said, Serbian and Croatian is basically the same, for example in this lyrics the only difference I can think of is that Croats would say proljeće (spring) while Serbs say proleće and Croats would say voljeti instead of voleti (to love). Much of differences between Croat and Serb is based on pronounciation differences between <em>ije</em>kavica (Croat) and <em>e</em>kavica (Serb), ie. Croats use ije and Serbs only e, like lijepo (beautiful; Croat) vs. lepo (Serb).</p>

<p>I'm happy that you'll meet your old friend. It's cool to keep some old friends, whatever they are, they remind you of old times. I have some idiotic old friends (outside the fascist scene) who I call from time to time. Fuck it, I have some fascist friends from the old days whom I've known for 8, 9 years and still hang out with them regularly. One of them is known as the "drama queen" because he always used to start troubles (fights) with random people (ie. dramas, as we say here <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" />) and the other is simply horrible while on cocaine. Still, friends are friends.</p>
