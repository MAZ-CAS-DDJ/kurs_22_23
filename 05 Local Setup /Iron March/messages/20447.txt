	I was just wondering in general if there's anything interesting to it, like if there was a specific reason for starting the petition or how likely you think it'll be succesful etc.<br /><br />
	The petition article itself seems to be from early June so it's not really "new" enough to qualify as news, meaning my text probably won't get approved for publishing esp. since it's foreign news, but I'd still like to try and highlight news related to Serbian nationalism when possible since it's not something that Swedish nationalists know a lot about.<br /><br />
	If there are any interesting developments in general within Serbian activism/politics that you think might be interesting to an international audience, or is otherwise noteworthy, call me maybe and we can go bowling.
