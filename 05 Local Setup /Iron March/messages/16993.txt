	Same here (using this forum has served its purpose) so I'll shoot you an email and we can talk more through that. I don't use my faceberg page anymore, or tumblr... :(

	Yeah, Twitter is the only Social Media platform where I'm active; lots of connections there, enough I'm sure to dissuade your suspicions ;)

	I'll email you later today, looking forward to it as well!
