	I saw your intro post, welcome to Iron March! Really well written stuff, I am the current leader of the Atomwaffen Division, currently Odin (leader) is in basic training so he has given me the helm of the ship while he is off doing his thing. You really seem like an intelligent and active individual. I would love to collaborate and work with you in the future.
