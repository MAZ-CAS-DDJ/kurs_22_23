	Yeah. One of the 'greatest' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pai-de-santo" rel="external nofollow">pai-de-santosÂ </a>in Brazil lives in my state's capital, Curitiba, and he is very known throughout the world of occultism and things like that, and has given advice to numerous people. If I remember correctly, he is a British South-African who traveled all over Africa to learn about deities and voodoo stuff, came to Brazil and established his 'terreiro' (kind of a temple). He currently advises almost all major 'terreiros' in Brazil, and has plan of codifying their 'religion' into a book of practices etc. They are also very tightly related to Freemasonry here.
