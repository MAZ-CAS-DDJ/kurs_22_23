	Why thank you! I've always loved Australia as well and hope to visit someday, sibling nations of the Empire and all that.

	Hope you get to Tasmania, thankfully the region I'm in (The Maritimes) hasn't yet been hit with the wave of diversity that much so I'm hoping to get my gal over here sometime in the next couple years (She's from and still in Portugal for the time being).

	And I'm a bit jealous of you growing up with that many siblings, I only have one brother and wished I could have been more like my parents where they each had 3-5 siblings. Sorry to hear about your ex, that's a terrible thing to do to someone but happy to hear that you've found someone to spend your life with. I'm sure he'll come round in time with having more kids, that instinct to carry on your genes can't be suppressed forever.

	Hoping for a good half-dozen children myself, but I largely leave that up to my gal since she'll be the one carrying and delivering them. Still, I think once we have our first she's going to want a lot more, she's very nervous about becoming a mother. I'm in the military currently and hoping to use that as a financial stepping stone to get into agriculture, so that in case the worst happens and things come tumbling down, I can still feed my family.

	No worries about the reply
