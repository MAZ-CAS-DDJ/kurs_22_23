	Well I don't have to worry about that, I had crossed paths with some of them - one of them runs a discord server which is meant to be a hub for admins of various "right wing" discord servers.Â Had several arguments with him (3 total) and during the last one he finally got triggered so hard he banned me and anyone IM related. So they locked us out themselves I imagine.
