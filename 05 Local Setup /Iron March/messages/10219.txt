<p>here's the article if you wanna read it, the "bongs" themselves are actually very beautiful pieces of art. probably the best preserved scythian art ever discovered actually. </p>
<p>And yeah, I've read Herodotus' Histories and he says they burned hemp seeds, made their clothes out of hemp and burned whole plants in their temples. and yet they still skinned people alive and constantly raided the greeks </p>

<p>and they say reefer madness isnt real </p>

<p>to me it almost seems like the attraction of 40k is that it promises that we will return to a time of glory and adventure like the ancient times, but even more awesome and in space. I love fantasy but sometimes I cant help but feel a kind of nostalgia from it because I know we will never go back to that, we're stuck in this modern prison. </p>
<p>I also really like the idea of humanity being something to be proud of instead of being born with original sin. not even a jab at christians, people in the modern world all over seem to think humans are a sickness. </p>

<p>we are children of the gods</p>
