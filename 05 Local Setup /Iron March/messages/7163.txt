<p>Sounds good, like a lot of fun! Yes, summer, we have that here too <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> I have just graduated from high school so there has been a lot of celebrating.<br /><br />Yes I watched Croatia! Played quite well, especially considering opponent. Bad refereeing though, but what can you do! It was a good game overall.<br /><br />I've been well! Looking for a second job. A little Croat man (first i've seen in a long while) came to the hotel I work at, and when I heard his voice I said hello to him. He ordered some coffee and we talked. He laughed at my bad Croatian singing, it was fun <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /><br /><br />Â </p>
