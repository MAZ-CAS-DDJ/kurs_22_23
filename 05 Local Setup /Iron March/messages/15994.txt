	Haha, I was particularly wondering what you think about the past. Bulgars and Magyars shared quite a lot and I honestly consider hungarians our brothers, even though we shared quite a lot of our history with Romanians. I am particularly not a believer of our asiatic origin and the whole Tangra thingy, because a random tribe from Asia can't simply come to the slavic lands, unite them and create a country out of the blue. Things don't work like that. Slavs didn't create a Slavic country themselves and suddenly the Bulgarians come on their mighty horses and united the country. Yes, we invented the cyrilic alphabet, yes we are Orthodox,  but besides that I don't feel slavic at all. The whole slavic thing I see as a soviet propaganda - you know, to make more and more allies in the cold war thing and stuff. Quite a lot of stuff was forged to fit the slavic bullshitry, hell we dumped 2-3 letters from our alphabet to make it closer to the russian one.

	As of the Balkan War and WW1 - it is funny. We destroyed the famous russian cavalry in Dobrudza, we entered in Bucharest and occupied it along with Germans, we crushed the Serbs on the Western front (google the Albanian Golgota of the Serbs) but in the end we lost, because the economy was about to collapse.

	As of today, things are going better. There is poverty but things are going better. I doubt we are the poorest country, but still we are somewhere in the bottom, haha :D <br /><br />
	PS: I respect Russia but I am more of a rusophobe so I was pretty happy that the Stream thingy failed. Not that I love the EU - quite the opposite but hell, I am totally against the russian politics now. Their people are nice - their politicians on the other hand, esp. the midget is a different story.
