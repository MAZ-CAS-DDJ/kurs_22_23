<p>No problem. Personally not got a problem with Alex, he doesn't seem to have such a large hard on for the USSR as he used to, but I've always thought denying it was Jewish and being pro-USSR was a bit gay, considering it made many concessions and wavered on its principles due to how shit communism/bolshevism is. I thought Stalin was cool alongside with Hitler when I was like 15. Are you restricted from replying in certain parts of the forum?</p>
