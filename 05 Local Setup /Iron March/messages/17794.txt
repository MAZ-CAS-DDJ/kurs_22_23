	Italy and Germany where Socialist ethically but not economically. They where corporatist, the right-wing version of putting socialist ethics into economics. I have a couple questions. There is a common misunderstanding to what prevents monopolies from forming, people have wrongly been misled to believe that it’s government regulations that prevent the monopolies when in real fact it’s the government regulations that create them, so why? Two vitally important concepts at work that prevent monopolies from forming:

<p>
	1. Consumer Choice<br />
	2. Competition
</p>

	The free market economy is fiercely competitive with strong consumer choice. I know they remove private trade unions and make it a publicly negotiated thing (class cooperation) but what exactly stops monopolies, lobbying, over regulation &amp; corruption from forming under corporatism ie the negation of the above two? I don't know if there is a perfect system but its we can atleast come up with the most pragmatic.

	While Fascist Capitalism is certainly not a concrete alternative, and I disagree with some of FascistCapitalism's points eg capitalists lose alot of their value when tons of competitors enter the market with cheaper goods for instance, then its not about entrepreneurialism but 99% about good management ie less about owners &amp; much more about managers and his shit about Neoclassical &amp; Austrian school of economics. The closest thing to a "hard science" in economics is a combination of ALL the schools of economics including post-Keynesian that takes into account the role of currency for economic models by calculating private debt. Fascist Capitalism private debt would still be a major problem as a result of its a growing financial sector capable of doing ponzi schemes (type 1 and type 2), even if the state becomes isolationist &amp; blocks international banking. I personally think its harmless though to discuss it and its the people that keep on suggesting that we should allow modern liberal trade unions, social-democrat &amp; Marxist unions to be left undisturbed that is frightening &amp; the insinuation by some people that workers are equal to owners &amp; managers. Racial hierarchy, national hierarchy, and hierarchy amongst individuals as well, is all vital to a organic society.
