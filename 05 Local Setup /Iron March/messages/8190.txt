<p>G’day, Sounds shit hot mate, since I had to work, was dust and hot as fuck weather for me. I really dig your enthusiasm mate, it is infectious and kind of what I’ve been wanting to find for some time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I think your right about Jim pretty much agreeing with our worldview, I can’t really disagree with his Integral Nationalism document, it is solid. From what I understand, Australia First isn’t really a manifestation of his anyway, he replaced weaker leadership and more than likely has improved it immensely, as his prior history in Nationalism is admirable and intellect is worthy of praise and the position that he has been granted is well deserved, almost as a father figure of Australian Nationalism. His championing of the three tiers of activism is also realised by himself, as I have seen him on the streets and abroad, I think in NZ, megaphone in hand, leftist snarling from their Police subdued positions, in an intelligent and strait forward protest.</p>
<p>He has obviously realised the worth of attacking what every day Australians can observe with their eyes…Immigration, Chinese Imperialism and the displacement of our folk in the workplace, this is completely relevant and legitimate in my eyes as I think he understands the greater forces in which we struggle, when attacked, are relentless in their attempts to sub-due and discredit, something that you don’t see a lot of in our media, if any over here, Jewish venom being spat upon Australia First and little done to discredit them. if this is a tactic that Jim believes works, by all means I will support him, as I have and will do in the future, if his anti-Zionism, as stated in the Anti-Jerusalem Pact, is a shroud for anti-Semitism, a way to smoke-screen a good understanding of the Semitic forces in which we fight, than again I cannot disagree but I could if it weren't and what was meant by the Pact was a position on Middle Eastern policy.</p>

<p>As much as Old Labor was Nationalist and Socialist, it lacked the deeper spiritual guidance toward those who can’t manifest it upon themselves, its temperament, a testimony to the time’s in which it thrived, one could draw the same line in America and their founding fathers but I’m sure a lot of Americans don’t see that as something they want to succumb to again, we are revolutionary are we not? Jim is over 50, how much of Australia First is demographically older and wiser, I say wiser in the conservative, been around a hundred years sense, like when your old man tells you not to try again with another woman because shell break your heart but you say fuck it and do it anyway…We are young and shouldn’t give a fuck or let anything stand in our way, or so we should think and I think NA represents very nicely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In some ways the fascist worldview, minus politics and all that, was found within much of the colonial new world’ers, in a greater and deeper understanding of nature and our place within it, the relevance of self-preservation, family and kin, providing for the folk within the community, in which no one but themselves and their folk could help and wrapping it in a non-materialistic and religious shroud, even if you are anti-Christian, their lives were lived through their sons and daughters and God, no matter what draught, war or famine. A culture like this with a government like Old Labor could be akin to Australian National Socialism, a modern culture like ours with a government like Old Labor would be confused.    </p>
