<p>I know that feel man, I thought the Nazis were awesome as a kid; there was no shame in pretending to be one when we played War on the playground at school. The 6 million wasn't pushed as much as the "hurf Hitler wanted to take over England and the world and make everyone blonde with blue yes" not until secondary school when they started talking about the gas chambers and all I could do was laugh about it cos I was an edgy 12 year old.</p>

<p>My daughter has seen pics of Mussolini and Hitler and knows bits and pieces about them which I've told her so she's a step ahead of anything school's gonna tell her. I always find out what she's "learning" in school and straight up tell her what's bullshit and what isn't. Love my duaghter to bits but can't wait until I have a son to carry on my tear away legacy at school.</p>
