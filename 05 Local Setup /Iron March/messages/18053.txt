	Personal contacts. I feel perhaps my comments have been overblown, this was all from an offhand conversation when we went off on a tangent discussing Melbourne in general.

	I will come back to this question tomorrow and give a worthy answer, however for now I will say my approach is consolidation and expansion starting out. I will flesh out this response far more tomorrow, I typed out something before and realised my response felt flat and half baked: been a long day.

	On another note, I am making serious steps to travel to Melbourne in the (very) near future. If you have Wickr, feel free to pass along your details and perhaps we can work out some sort of arrangement in real time. I am very keen to build bridges across states so far but am weary of how we can all proceed in order to protect ourselves in isolation whilst still working towards common goals.
