	Ah, I used to live there myself. Lived in a nice isolated house in Carpinteria, between Santa Barbara and Ventura. It's not as nice now as it used to be though, too many damn people. Seems like most small towns are getting that way now, the traffic in Riverside is 10x worse than when my folks lived there decades ago.
