<p>Thanks for your input Ben. Appreciated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah, I'd rather maintain my anonymity. Not that I'm allergic to public attention (if it happens, it happens...) but more like 'why give them ammunition?'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'll set about obtaining a list of the attendees from the previous camp, but I also think we need an extra layer of security somewhere. Reading up on basic body language would make us significantly more impenetrable to all but a few would-be intruders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also using encrypted means of communication - as opposed to facebook, regular email, and a free forum; as Craig was doing. I use Hushmail and Safe-mail for nearly all important correspondence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another difference between Craig's way and my way: there's always a trade-off between style and substance. I prefer to establish something of substance, then give it style. Craig's approach was the other way around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His 'black metal' aesthetic was solid, I agree. As long as we keep it from straying over into being an obvious attempt at attracting black metal people, I see no reason to change it. And like we said, we can develop it over time too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On a related note, I'm setting about creating some of my own black metal. We also potentially have 2 other BM projects by NA lads. Black metal is mostly populated by people who point-blank refuse to acknowledge the importance of theory in musical composition. So if I can teach our guys some simple stuff (how to create a coherent melodic structure using structural tones, how to shape a melody, etc.) then in theory it should be surprisingly easy to monopolise the scene in a given area (i.e. Britain.) We could then leverage that into recruitment for Sigurd.</p>
