<p>Do you have facebook? I'd be much more confortable talking to you through it than through forums because from past experiences anti-fascists used to hack pro-fascist forums and gathetered personal info, that's why I never talk about anything personal through these PMs. FB or skype are a different game, you have your government on your back but they're harmless unless you actually plan something stupid on the internet. I don't care about antifascists either but it's more about my comrades who could be harmed through what I write here.
