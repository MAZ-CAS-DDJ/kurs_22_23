<p>Hello, I am new to Iron March. I am a Prussian Socialist/Revolutionary Conservative from Texas. According to your information you live in Pennsylvania, I went to Penn State up there last year. Oswald Spengler is my biggest influence, obviously. I read your posts about Oswald Spengler. What else you think about his ideas? Russia, in particular? I thought your post about America and Russia was interesting but vague. In addition, where do all the members of Iron March get to know each other outside of the forums?</p>
