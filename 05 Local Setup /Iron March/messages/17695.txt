	how many times you think it will take to flag the vid?
</p>

<p>
	i think google doesn't close the vid if only one person flags the vid, maybe many people...
</p>

<p>
	and even if google shuts down the vid, the guy will imediately upload the same vid, cause the guy is psycothic, obsessed, criminal and really want to destroy me.  he is a neocon gay jew (confirmed, not a shadow of doubt)
</p>

<p>
	gotta be a solution...one may not hack the youtube channel to remove the vid? or at least the image?
</p>

<p>
	the vid has 4:33, and only shows my image frame for a few seconds.
</p>

<p>
	the solution is either remove the vid, or upload the same vid, but without the seconds i appear.
</p>

<p>
	and also, hack is computer to remove files he certainly has of me...
</p>

<p>
	but first, before hack is channel, i have to remove the links from 3 blogs, because if i hack is channel first and remove my image, it's really easy for him to get my image again, because he knows where they are. do you understand?  the youtube channel has to be the last thing to attack.

	kali Linux. is that good?
