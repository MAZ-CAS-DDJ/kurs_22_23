<p>Hey mate. Sending you a PM since I don't want to keep cluttering up the Anniversary thread.<br /><br />Just wanted to drop some gratitude for the recommend on Rockwell's speeches- listened to this one:</p>

<p>last night and without hyperbole it totally blew me away. Had no idea how good a speaker he was, and how much his public persona differs from the way he's presented in the media/history books. Really convincing dude, and a sense of humour that even had his enemies laughing. Good stuff.<br /><br />Dunno if you're aware of this, was going to post it myself once I become active but it might interest you:<br /><br /></p>

It's got an anti slant of course, but it's got some relatively unknown info and the pictures in the article have supposedly never been published before.
