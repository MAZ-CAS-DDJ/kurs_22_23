American_Blackshirt, in <em>Reaktion</em>, explicitly defines pretty much everyone currently in the US, Anglo or Continental, white or black, as American, except for illegal Hispanic immigrants. Yes, I suppose this is Civic Nationalism, but were I an American I'd rather take the option that turned the US into an autonomous isolationist state by reviving the things that made it great than the one that turned it into a colony again. (However, both options are sufficiently far away from the current American mindset that I can't see either being realised in the near future.) I'm watching your debate with Kacen with great interest.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Why? I think civic nationalism is stupid. It is idealism with no basis in the material world. Were all just supposed to be united cause were white, black, brown, cause we're all "Amuurikans!". Where as the ideal of the European is an ideal rooted in Europeans themselves. </p>
