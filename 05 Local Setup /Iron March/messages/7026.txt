<p>Haha, why do they keep you on a short chain, did you do anything wrong? <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> I can't see the picture you posted, something wrong with the link. I hike sometimes, there are some nice hills around Ljubljana. When I was younger we used to have on of these houses in the Alps rented: <a href="http://jostgantar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_4444_pano_obd_net_640.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://jostgantar.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_4444_pano_obd_net_640.jpg</a> This mountain is right near this lake: <a href="http://www.bohinj-info.com/design/uploads/bohinjsko_jezero_pec_ps3.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://www.bohinj-info.com/design/uploads/bohinjsko_jezero_pec_ps3.jpg</a> It's in the north-west part of our country. Those were some good times, I like Alps and lakes a lot, more than seaside. I don't like fishing that much though, I don't have the nerves. To be honest, I'm not in the nature much lately, I've always been a city kid. My hobbies are boxing and playing football (soccer). </p>

<p>Will you watch Croatia on football world cup in Brazil? It's always a big thing for Croats when they play on these tournaments.. They play the opening match against Brazil, I think it's next thursday (12.6.).</p>
