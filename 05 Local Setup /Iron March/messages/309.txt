<p>Cool, I wasn't sure if you still lurked or not. i have always taken an interest in what you have to say and I would like to interview you as you are ideally what I am looking for. This has always been an ambition because a journal like reaction is supposed to be about fascistic undercurrents in american life - a seviceman is an ideal subject and it would lend the whole thing much needed credibility. Recently I have heard a few soldiers stories and they make excellent food for thought, as most politics people think they know everything.</p>
<p>Just a few questions about you, your experiences, and your views on things.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
