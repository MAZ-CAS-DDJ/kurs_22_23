	It's nice to see someone else with prior experience in an organisation for a change. There's only one fucking guy over here from Daily Stormer,  been trying to meet him but he stopped talking as soon as I asked hahaha. Idk if he's nervous or what, but internet tier people from /pol/ and the like seem to be extra paranoid, and I'd wager it's out of cowardice.

	Have you read any of the Ironmarch material like Next Leap and the American Futurism Workshop?
