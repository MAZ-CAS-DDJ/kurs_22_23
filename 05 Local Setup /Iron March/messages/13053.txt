	Well the name is based off that standard fuck party video. <br />
	There was no gay shit or any pool. It was just a meeting in a pub where we talked about random issues. <br /><br />
	The guy who organizes the 'standard pool parties' in Melbourne is a guy called 'Baby Hitler'. He's a around 35 years old guy who goes around putting up 'Stop White Genocide' stickers. He's pretty cool guy tbh. I'm a student without a job, so he offered to buy me a used printer so that I could print A3 posters and put them up in and around the CBD. I sent him a message a few days ago saying that I was going to be printing out IronMarch posters and not the more tame White Genocide ones but he hasn't got back to me yet.<br /><br />
	Anyway I don't want to signal against therightstuff guys, they're good guys.<br /><br />
	The only other IronMarcher that I know is in Melbourne, is Kehlsteinhaus and he hasn't messaged me in response to the post I made. Do you have any fascist friends irl?
