<p>I've been reading your stuff this morning. Very interesting stuff. The parts on Hyperborea are enlightening, and having spent a few years reading that jackboot shamansim stuff its nice to see a sensible explanation of what so many get wrong.</p>
<p>I have a better understanding of how you view the world  now, a d it's not too different from my own. I just dont take the time  to formalise my views.</p>
<p>I still can't get used to memespeak however. I'm a scientist by amateur profession, so my writing comes across as formal and 'spergy'.</p>
<p>Anyway, I like the tumblr. I'm looking forward to this book.</p>
