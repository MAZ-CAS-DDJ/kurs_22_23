<p>I see. This actully makes alot of sense. However I believe that a Pope serves as an Iconic figure, well atleast for the Catholic people. Shouldn't it be essential that every all branches of the judeo-christian faith have such a figure. As you described the Archbishop and the Pope are quite similiar when it comes to that. I know that the protestants and other christians do not.</p>
