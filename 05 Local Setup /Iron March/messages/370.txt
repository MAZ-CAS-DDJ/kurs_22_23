<p>My response as a Christian is fairly simple. I take the Old Testament for what it is: historical record. When Christ came, it was like out with the old, in with the new. Things change. We don't sacrifice animals, wear weird costumes or do all of the other strange things Jews did. </p>
<p>As I type this I am so distracted. </p>
<p>Okay. I guess that sums it up. It's good enough for me, anyway. I don't go for the whole Christian Identity thing. I just don't know enough about it, and I feel like it complicates things. I try to keep my religion simple. I stick to the ten commandments and the teachings of Christ. It's a lifestyle. I don't bother with church and all that ritual and suchlike. </p>
<p>I dunno, I have heard things about false Jews, the Bible talking about people who say they're Jews but aren't, etc. It's just not something I've looked into a whole lot. I don't think being a Christian is necessary to be a National Socialist or a fascist. </p>
<p>There's my two cents. I could probably come up with more to say, but I just woke up and I'm distracted.</p>
