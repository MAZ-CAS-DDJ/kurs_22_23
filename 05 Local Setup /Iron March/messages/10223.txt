<p>yeah exactly,they usually even think we gave them favors and that helped them more than the africans during colonization. </p>
<p>they're somewhat right, but only because the indians and asians actually had something to offer and gave back to our empires. the africans did nothing, we built africa for them. </p>

<p>social media is cancer, i quit my facebook pretty recently. i mean i understand why it exists and i appreciate it for keeping in contact with old friends but its just a giant datamining scam. what i hate most though is what it turns people into. nobody gives a shit about your salad, stop taking pictures of it every damn day you attention seeking whore. </p>
<p>its all like some weird, warped popularity contest that isnt based on any actual charisma or socialization, but on who has the most e-friends and the best filters on their selfies </p>
<p> </p>
<p>indjuns are right about one thing, I think cameras steal a little part of your soul. makes sense considering the people most exposed to them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've learned to find a balance, theres a few hours out of every day where i just listen to music and read or play games and just pretend the world aint even happening. But when im not doing that, I dont know how people find it boring. I guess its because I view things kinda comically dark as they are. its the only way to keep sane. </p>

<p>bread and circuses is the most perfect term to describe americas current situation. except we're more like high calorie "natural" bun bread and hollywood, which is just a big televised circus of fools. </p>

<p>i remember middle school i first started noticing the trend of faggifying america's youth. the cool thing now was skinny jeans, those faggot belts with studs on them, sagging pants (yes, with skinny jeans and a belt) and styling your hair like a homosexual. fuck, boys put more damn effort into their hair in this country than girls do. a proper man doesnt need much more than a clipper, you dont have to look like a patchy hobo but fuck. </p>
<p>alot of "straight" guys i know even have lip piercings. I dont know how you can call yourself a straight man with those fucking things but whatever. </p>
<p>id sure love to see one of those fags get in a fight with those on. easy target. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>and yeah, im honestly a pretty gentle person on the inside but i realize that the world is not for the gentle. the only living things allowed to be gentle are plants, and I appreciate having a vertebrae and sentience. as is said in the havamal </p>

<p>Betimes must rise when a man must take </p>
<p>Another's life and his wealth</p>
<p>Lying down wolf never caught the sheep </p>
<p>Nor sleeping crow defeated the hawk. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>either fight and die or starve and die, take your pick, but I like the fun one more. </p>
