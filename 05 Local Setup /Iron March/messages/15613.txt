	1. Yup, that constitution stuff is a bit strange, since it is us, Hungarian Traditionalists who want to reestablish our Old Constitution (but I think we will need to create a modern interpretation also) based upon the Holy Crown of Saint Stephen. Apart from that, I think he has a point, because for me it looks like that the Constitution of Romania is heavily influenced by modernism, the French revolution, the American constitution and so on. I think that when the Traditionalist Revolution comes, the true Romanians will be able to exceed their 'Modern Nationalism' and will go back to the principles of Basarab Întemeietorul and Ștefan cel Mare.

	I don't know a lot about that bombing attempt, but the Hungarian media naturally portrays it as a false flag. In my opinion there is a high possibility that those guys really wanted to blow something up since there are voices from the Hungarian right calling for a more aggressive resistance against the Romanian state in Szeklerland. They argue that if the peaceful attemtps were fruitless, we have to try something else. On the other hand, I don't think that an autonomous Szeklerland would serve our cause (maybe I am alone with this opinion in Hungary). What I think is that we need some kind of 'Traditional Transylvanism', a supranational concept based on the sanctity of Transylvania perceived by our nations, which would end all of our territorial disputes once and for all. We need to guard this place, not to use it as a battlefield.

	What you are saying about the minorities is right, but you shouldn't give more autonomy because of the minorities, but because of political and historical reasons. It's a historical fact that Transylvania is a masterpiece made by three nations, and if Hungary had a sin, it is that they have denied this fact after 1848. That's a long topic but I would like to have a discussion with you and other Romanian Fascists on it.

	2. I didn't mean traditional people, I meant Traditionalists, who are reading Evola, Guénon and the Romanian classics. Could you show me that traditional shirt of the Romanian girls? One of my friends who is a student in Cluj told me a strange story about a night in which he saw a girl in white clothes surrounded by a circle of chanting man. He told me that it was some kind of Orthodox ritual. Can you tell me something about that?

	Yes, I know what the fucking Communists did with true Romanians. I also know that a lot of Hungarians worked for the Securitate because they wanted to get revenge on your people... That's typical, you know? There is a power which is against God and Nation, but we will gladly support it against each other until both of our people will be Godless hordes of white trash.
