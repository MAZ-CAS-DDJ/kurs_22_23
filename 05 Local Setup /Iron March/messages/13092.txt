	I just dont see the point in following a page where I know all of that and its not a priority to me. I can not spend forever thinking of the same thing. My attention span can't allow it.

	I am trying to expand my knowledge base in other ways. For example, reading books about things I don't already know or try to learn about Australian history, European history, the Gobal rulers, their religion/cult, their future plans, as I wish to stay a step ahead.

	Plus I am learning about homeschooling now, figuring a curriculum and figuring out which skills my children will REALLY need in the future. It is a tough job having the burden of knowledge. :)
