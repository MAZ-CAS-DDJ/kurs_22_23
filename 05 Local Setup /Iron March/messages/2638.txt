<p>It's a great danger to the whole of Europe from any aspect; we can never predict what is going to come out of that God-forsaken, frozen pit half the time and whether or not it is going to be friendly with us. We Germans certainly tried, twice..and in the first weltkrieg, we had nearly done it..although in the second weltkrieg, we could have done better. But we tried, regardless. </p>
