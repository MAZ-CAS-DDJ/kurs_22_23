	Closer to 5'6 than 5'7. Mussolini was 169cm. Hitler was only 172cm IIRC so you can march with pride knowing you're the same height as him. Here in Australia we've got about 10 guys in our group. I haven't measured myself compared to them but we're not far from each other in height generally. Most are around either my height or your height.

	It's not something you should worry about too much. I should've been taller but a childhood of sleep deprivation and malnutrition will do that to you. Just gotta make do with what you've got. Plus when I put on my combat boots I gain an extra 3-5cm so that bumps me up to 5'7 or 5'8.

	If the premise of the book sounds interesting enough to you go for it. It's not a happy story or something you can come away with a greater positivity from, it portrays negativity very well however so it's not bad. A good insight into the Japanese character in a negative light. Not purely Japanese however, but it's obviously seen in that lens. An implicit critique of modernity and its effect on life, particularly the youth.
