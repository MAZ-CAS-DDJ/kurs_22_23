	The position sympathy of yours makes sense as a "unifying" &amp; overton window shifting side of the right, to never attack right-wingers but its effects on the masses are debatable. However as a fascist or for some racially aware monarchist's the correct position is clearly to be of strong character and principled and therefore not flexible, this is because the conservatives, nationalists &amp; reactionaries are not truly right-wing economically or socially, but influenced by leftists due to the higher &amp; lower "education" ie paid for indoctrination and utopian idealistic misleading history of freedom that merely leads towards a abyss where whites are left as a doormat for the rest of the world. Its about as sad a fate as one can imagine, a fascist knows better than to encourage that kind of mindset. Theres no need to give someone a pat on the back if they are clearly helping the enemy by implicitly or explicitly taking on practically the same moral relativistic, greed/selfish &amp; anti-white ideology. Being inclusive as a party makes no sense, because then the belief and zealousness won't be there to protect from external shocks, any violent event will break the group down because its strength is only as strong as the weakest members which are much more numerous the more inclusivity there is. But as a movement inclusiveness is only a positive as far as someone can a show a willingness to learn &amp; change, and therefore ascend to towards valuing and upholding truth in action. When the movement requires action than those already of that mindset will be ready, the rest will be left behind. I'd prefer if no one is left behind but theres only so much olive branches that one can metaphorically shove into someones face.
