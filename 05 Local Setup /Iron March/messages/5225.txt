<p>I've toyed around with the idea of "super multiculturalism" in my head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So many Canadians are sold on multiculturalism because we like foreign cultures but we tend to ignore the fact that if these cultures live together and follow the multicult dream of coming together and mixing they'll be mutually destroyed. We already have examples (at least in British Columbia) of cultures that have come in in large enough numbers though that their communities have retained language, religion, customs, and ethnic makeup while adopting distinctly Canadian customs and patriotism that makes them acceptable to their fellow countrymen. For instance the Chinese in Richmond and Punjabs in Surrey. Of course white Canadians would no longer be guilted and would instead be told to embrace their glorious European and colonial heritage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Championing this as "the Canadian model" against integration we could push for pride and preservation of each groups heritage but unite under a common banner for mutual defence (both militarily and culturally against American hegemony) and prosperity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's still very much an in the works thought at the moment though trying to reconcile the various forces at work within our country in a positive way.</p>
