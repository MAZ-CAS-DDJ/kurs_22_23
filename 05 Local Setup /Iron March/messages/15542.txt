	We also had some relatives who left Hungary and gone to various places like Great Britain, Australia and Canada. It's funny how none of them has gone to the USA. Sad thing is that I don't really have a Fascist hero in my family as far as I know (though I have a WW1 hero and an Adventurer nobleman), but I have two Commies. In a way I am glad for that since because of that I was able to become interested in Communism, I researched it and I rejected it based on internal knowledge. In that process I have also learned that a man have to be able to explore and purge the history of his family, to reject it's darkness but accept it's light and guard it with his life.

	You are a good man taking care of the old Hungarian friend of yours.

	About the Muslims... I know some who are very good people. They are also searching for God only in different ways. The migrants coming here are the shittiest Muslims. Don't reject a whole religion because of that trash, because, if you were in America you know how crazy the Christians could be. Well, a lot of Muslims are hating Christians because they see only the American type of Christianity, and when the NATO invaded them they told themselves "it was the Christians". Same stuff with Serbs. If you ask them about Catholicism, they will say it's the Vatican behind everything, they control the whole West and they want to destroy Orthodoxy. We know that's bullshit, so judge the religion, not the follower. All followers are sinners, some of them bigger, some of them smaller.
