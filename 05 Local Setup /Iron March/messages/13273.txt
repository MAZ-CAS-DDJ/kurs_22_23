	I myself am in the second year of my A-levels, I'm the youngest of them all.<br />
	Â It's not active enough to get in the way, trust me :D Since the beginning of March there's only been two meet ups so get in there as soon as really, before you miss out on anything (you'll miss the Annual Convention even if you emailed them today)

	I'd say just send an email to <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> London, you'll get an email back in a day or two (hopefully, as I said London suffers from organisation issues :c). I know exams are in like 4/5 weeks (for me at least, don't know about you) however there isn't enough going on at the moment to really get in the way. Always good for more people to join, means we can arrange more stuff which is just more fun for everybody!<br />
	Any questions?
