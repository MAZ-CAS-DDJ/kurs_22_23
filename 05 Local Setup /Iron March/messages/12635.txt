<p>If you're asking about Jews, Catholicism, or fascism, my answer to all is unfortunately no. Everyone's all 'poor Yids dindu nuffin', and the few Catholic friends I have consider it a virtue to not follow what the Bible says. And as far as fascism goes, people will talk the talk as long as you don't tell them it's fascism, but when you do... *sigh* Do you personally know anyone who shares your views? If you have a local chapter of the SSPX, you're bound to have some people who aren't so kosher. What about young people, though? Sorry I didn't reply to this earlier. Several assessments and two school productions in the same week have just about killed me. How has your week been?</p>
