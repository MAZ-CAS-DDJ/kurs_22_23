<p>A good defense of the utility of racial consciousness and homogeneity in the context of statecraft in your opening post. Well said.<br /><br />"Just because something does not exist biologically doesn't mean that it can't be real. It would be very harmful for those of us of European descent to lose all race consciousness, because many of the positive biological traits that contribute to productivity and collective potential are found in higher abundance in our "race"."<br /><br />You're contradicting yourself completely here but I think you only do so because you swallowed some of the red-herrings which have confused this issue for decades - you assume you're in the company of a bunch of "if you're white then you're alright!" types - but you should know that the question of race you elucidated toward the end of the quoted section above is actually what it's all about. Indeed, that is what it was all about even back then.<br /><br />As for this place and its denizens you might feel they are fit only for the trenches in some future upheaval. I wouldn't disagree, I'm writing because you sound quite switched on to what's important and have displayed a certain dignity not reciprocated by your hosts.<br /><br />If you frequent other boards where themes you've outlined can be discussed openly please let me know. My favorite online places - largely unmoderated free-for-alls where argument alone determines victory -  have sadly all since been removed (due to the hard truths which tend rise up when they can't be so easily snuffed - Nazism, Fascism, Race Realism, Pathological Altruism, Jewish Power (hard and soft) in the West, the Islamic Issue, The Corruption and Weakness of Western Elites, <em>Natural</em> Hierarchy, The Psychological Trauma of the Post War Narrative on Europids around the globe and so on). This trend of killing free speech boards (legal pressures and so on) has created the fracturing we see today - places like this, and others of all flavours, left, right and in between - which degenerate into cultic circle jerks and grow weak and pretentious in the absence of challenging  counters. It's all just choir preaching in the end and that doesn't help anyone.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you know a cool forum where the punters have the stomach for strong drink, let me know. I mainly lurk here for the more 'militant' perspective as well as the genuine humour and 'red-pill' injections that are the "Liberal Degeneration" thread and others. I guess also to put obscure figures of history on the radar too, it's good for that. I drop posts now and then but I'm more interested in reaching new audiences than masturbation in the beer hall. But this site is really just a war cry - an embarrassingly adolescent one - it's not a university, not an academy - though you can find some decent materials here, it's just sad that its custodians are such vulgar freaks.</p>

<p>Anyway, take care - don't let these proles diminish your spark.</p>
