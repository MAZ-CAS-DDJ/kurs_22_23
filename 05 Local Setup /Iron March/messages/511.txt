<p>I did believe that was the case; feminism has always been a fringe group, but the arguments catch on a lot more freuqntly today while ironically women still take up their natural roles; there's no glass ceiling, it's simply because women don't want those higher positions, work less hours or are not qualified for them.</p>

<p>I do know there were a lot of women against feminism as is demonstrated in that link above, but the spun web is still stuck in most womens' hair today and they use the cliches of being oppressed which is a load of rubbish, they never had it easier. I guess you could call this neo-feminism.</p>
<p>I like Mosley's take on not letting women serve in the military, it coincides with John Tyndall's reasons which I'd posted in the neo-feminism thread. I don't see how anyone could ever say that women are ever as capable as men for physical or highly taxing mental work, taking all of history and statistics into account. The strongest women bodybuilders are still weaker than the weakest male body builders. What I really want is just a patriarchy that doesn't mirror the homoerotic 'patriarchy' of the islamic world. Of all leftist ideologies I do believe that feminism was the worst and most typically jewish (judaism, jewish culture and jewish nature is predominantly feminine and supportive of matriarchy).</p>
<p>Thanks for the info :thumbsup:</p>
