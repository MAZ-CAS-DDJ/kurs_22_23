<p>I see.</p>
<p>The Grey Wolves are probably the biggest nationalist organisation in Turkey, they are Turanists, though their ideology is merely a diluted version of what was adhered by the older generations. They also enjoy the backing of a fairly popular political party.</p>
<p>I'm a member of the Grey Wolves, active, taking part into organisations, but mostly keep to our own organisation within the campus.</p>
<p>I am more of a purist when it comes to ideology so I do not accept the revised version of Turkish nationalism that was put forward by Alparslan Türkeş, who included religion, to be more populist. Not to say I'm against religion, but I'm against it being used as a political leverege.</p>
<p>They also use cultural nationalism instead of one that is based on blood heritage, something which I condone instead of the vague definitions put forward by the same people. Its simply dishonest, and claims that anyone can be a Turk, which is, to say, that a known Gypsy can step forward and simply claim that he's Turkish and become the head of the organisation. It just makes no sense to me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other than that, there are a few minor organisations, that adhere to a viewpoint similar than mine, but I have ambitions of joining the Turkish political scene, and those small-scale organisations do not present much of a starting point.</p>
