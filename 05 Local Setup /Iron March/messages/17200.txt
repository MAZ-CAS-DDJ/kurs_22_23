	I liked Kota Hirano's interpretation of vampires being lovecraftian god like beings the more souls they consume , I also liked the saying Blood is the currency of the soul , that he put in.

	I remember watching the non ova tv series on youtube in 2007 it was pretty gud and then the OVA came out and I was like awesome. that was back when I was 13 so i waited and watched all the OVA's throughout highschool and then the last one finished my first year of college like 2012.

	of course everyone loves, secret nazi occult scifi

	I also liked the way the werewolves were portrayed similar as beings that could shapeshift but had similar properties as vampires.

	I think Hirano hinted in the world of Hellsing that supernatural creatures were beyond human understanding and couldn't be reduced to just basic mythology and folklore.  Also in this world it is apparent that God and the Devil exist in some sort of way influencing events.

	in the tv series the vampire Incognito summons the ancient egyptian god Set into his body to become stronger. In the OVA Alucard talks about alchemical texts "The bird of Hermes is my name eating my wings to make me tame" is from some medieval scroll.

	Honestly Hellsing is what got me interested in the occult.
