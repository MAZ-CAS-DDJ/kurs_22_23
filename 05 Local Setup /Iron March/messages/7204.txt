<p>Ah good, that makes sense. (Ja razumijem!) I will save that, very good. Hvala!<br /><br />No, worrying about how others disagree is never good. I was like this at first because I had never met anyone more extreme than 'conservative', but that has changed. My godsister and I came to this ideology together I would say. We're both from big Catholic families, and our lives for the most part have been very alike. But besides that I have met maybe 3 people who I can truly say are fascists. Well, even so, a lot of people agree with our ideals even if not entirely(Especially at Church! Ha!). This becomes very clear in class discussions xD<br /><br />It's good that you had a group to look up to and guide you in it. And being the one in school to be open about that later, that's very good. It's fun, the way people react to hearing plain truth. I am always thinking how lucky you all must be to have a community of like-minded people, all you in Europe, at least Slavic parts especially.<br /><br />And yes, post me the Slovene music!</p>
