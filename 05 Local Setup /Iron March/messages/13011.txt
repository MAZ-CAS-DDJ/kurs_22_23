	Why thank you, Braveheart's been one of my favourite films since forever.

	I'm well, yourself? I'm from the east coast of Canada.

	For that I applaud you, not many women today take the all natural route when it comes to births. Hoping to discuss the same thing with my gal, don't want my kids coming into this world for the first time on drugs. How many do you have/plan to have?
</p>

<p>
	It my biggest fear as well, that when I homeschool my own future kids. That they'd send some harpy to make sure everything's kosher or else my kids are being taken away. Hope they're ready to pay the price if they decide to do that.
