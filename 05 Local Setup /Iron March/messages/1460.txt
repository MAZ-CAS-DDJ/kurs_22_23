<p>Even though I am a Tripartist, this is not because of my ideology, but because I believe in a gradual evolution of the State. I believe that the end is that in which the State reigns supreme, the concept of 'individual' completely annihilated and replaced by <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>SI</strong></span>*. Tripartism and/or Syndicalism would be a logical beginning, I believe that all aspects of the State(including Society) must evolve in the same pace.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">SI </span></strong>- Swarm Intelligence (Though it might not be feasible, evolution to the highest point should still be continued. And still, one day it <em>might</em> be possible. We already know that even though Freud had flaws, the Ego, Superego and Id exist. A way to remove the Id and, consequently, the Superego may be possible one day.)</p>
<p>I loathe the current concept of 'dictator' that many inside and outside our ranks have. The role of the dictator is to provide the collective with a powerful State that will ensure that the predators are not vituperated or extirpated for their strength. A State in which the strong rule with an iron fist that no one will dare oppose. Destroying those who threaten the determined future of the collective. I find the current perception of State to be fraudulent. The State is designed not to help, but to lead the many to evolution.</p>
