	Hey, Wotan! Was wondering if the upcoming Siege would be 'shippable' to Mother Europe and in my case Bulgaria ? I am not fond of reading on the computer so even though it may come up pricey (poor part of europe) I feel like buying it and not the retarded indian version of it. And also supporting the fellas from AWD is pretty nice. Hope everything works well for you and the other burgers ^^Â <br />
	Cheers!
