<p>I'm not sure if this means anything but I just got onto a laptop that I've kept hidden in case I do lose communication with everyone. Anyway, I've heard stories of people being watched through webcams so I opened mine up and it wouldn't open, saying it was in use by another application. This laptop has been dead for several months, and I restarted it afterward to see if it fixed anything. Nope, still says another application was opened. So I checked manycam and I'm not sure if you've heard of it but basically its like some thing designed to share screen and webcam and whatever and its actually pretty neat but I wont go into detail. I opened it to see if that's what the problem was and it said that the webcam would not open because it is in use by another user account on the computer and I need to close everything on the other account before it would work. I was on the only account on the computer.</p>
<p>pretty spooky </p>
