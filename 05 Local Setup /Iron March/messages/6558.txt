<p>Hello friend, </p>
<p>Maybe you as a Russian can help me understand something; what is the near worship of some Russians for Hitler all about? Was I correct in surmising that it's similar to the reaction of Russians to the figure of Napoleon after their wars with him? I suspect a simple answer is an admiration for tenacity and courage, the respect warriors on opposite sides of a battlefield feel for each other, but maybe the answer is a bit more complex. Looking forwards to soon skyping with you and others, I'm serious about my commitment to formulation of a successful modern fascist movement worldwide, and to Russia the Third Rome. God bless,</p>
