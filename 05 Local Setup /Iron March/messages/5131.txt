<p>Ok, so I assume you're going to be resitting this year?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What universities are there in that area? Nottingham, is good. But I'm unaware of what other places that offer degree study.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We currently don't have anyone from Lincoln, so someone going around agitating around there should be a boon to us. Ideologically we intend on being hardline and uncompromising when it comes to our propaganda - it is all out attack.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What we can do is send leaflets to you via courier, it is quite expensive, but if you are going to distribute them, it is worth the cost. What are you limits when it comes to activism? Are you able to travel or are restricted geographically? Do only do things as part of a group or can you do things alone? Staying legal is obviously important. </p>
