	I am pro-ukrainian, first thing. Secondly, I am a bit anti-imperialistic - that means I am against both NATO and Russia. Thirdly, Russia interferes a bit too much in our politics and thinks they are bosses or something. They often try to twist hands of politcians, lobbby for russians interests here etc.  We are NATO/EU members, like it or not and Russia still think we are a national republic. Also russian PM's are acting arrogant and show absolutely no respect to us - recently some russian phony politician Pyotr Tolstoy said that they bought half Bulgaria and they plan on buying the other half aswell. He later apologised and said it was a humorous but overall he can hang himself. Russian tourists are more than welcome, cool people and stuff but their midget chieftain better watch his own things.
