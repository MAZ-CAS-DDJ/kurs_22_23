<p>Thanks, this is exactly what people need, you don't know what it is like with all these stuck up new-right (national anarchist whatever) assholes and their dimunitive White Nationalist political culture and it needs such a boot up it's arse. The tin foil hat complex where whoever works in security is a NWO tool is irritatingly prevelent - by which most white nationalists see the military as a threat to them and have abandoned the united states hoping it all breaks apart.</p>
<p>Sacred cows go unquestioned and people's moral reasoning is completely bent, so this will hopefully really upset some - there are so many things you said which are regarded as heresy (in the eyes of someone like david duke, proabably) but most people though will learn something I hope. I am also interested in this subject as my degree is mainly security studies and IR related topics.</p>
<p>I would like to straighten out the diversity. I get what you are saying, I knew a Hawaiian Staff Sergeant who joined after 9/11 and he was a really nice lad (though he must have been nearly 30, he looked much younger) - what i wanted to get at was that this 'diversity problem' in the military doesn't exist, like you say. I do also want to make the distinction though between servicemen and communities in the US which are for all intents and purposes not part of the states.</p>
<p>Then again what do i know? I have heard horrible things about gangs in the military so I wanted  to know what you thought.</p>
<p>What you gave is close to perfect though there will be editors magic - i would like to incorporate the odd forum post. mabye even your revent topic.</p>
<p>There are a couple of bits that need fleshing out though, some questions were coming from multiple directions</p>
<p>"s the US military an independent body? Is there lots of politics – or is it all tongue in cheek?"</p>
<p>By this I mean is the Army part of the Democra/republican political machine not too unlike the private sector/education industry/ church/ police force. When I hear about 'democrats' in the military It is liek it lives in some sort of bubble.</p>
<p>The British military as I have certainly come to know it is a bubble outside the new establishment. Like you say, they are even run by the same families as 100-200 years ago and in many respects have  not changed with the times thoght there is lip service. </p>
<p>I guess what I was asking is how well contianed is the military and does it have any indpendant capabilities.</p>
<p>"What is your opinion of the United States, what parts of it work and don’t work? Do you still support it? Why?"</p>
<p>This was a pretty open ended type of question, but a question was also asking was aside from (obviously) the military what parts of the US work; government, law enforcement, military industry, Security services, research, ect.</p>
<p>I was sort of heading along the same lines as this other question.</p>
<p>i thought you would be in a good position to pass judgement.</p>
