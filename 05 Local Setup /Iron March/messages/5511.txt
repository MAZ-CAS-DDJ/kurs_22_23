<p>That sounds a lot like our Bektashi Babas hahaha. People of high spiritual realization usually have a way a speaking and thinking that the unenlightened cannot understand. I have a few questions if you don't mind!</p>
<p>I know y'all don't get down with the pope. Who governs the church?</p>
<p>What happens at an orthodox service and how is it different than the Catholics?</p>
<p>What is the theological difference between orthodoxy and Roman Catholic?</p>
