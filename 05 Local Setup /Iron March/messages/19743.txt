	There are several solutions.
</p>

<p>
	1 - You have to buy a dummy type airsoft gun, lift the false weapon and put the real one in place. Then you have to send it to a mailbox in the united states created for the occasion that will respatch the parcel to France.

	2 - Disassemble the weapon into 4 parts. Canon, case, stock + handle, charger. It is necessary to surround the whole with bubble paper (to avoid the noises of shock). And send parcels in computer towers or in any other <span style="color:#ff0000;"><u><strong>metal</strong></u><strong> </strong></span>machine. Depending on the size of the camouflage object, one can put a certain number of parts of the weapon.

<p>
	For shipping, you can use the same system as for option 1
</p>

</p>

<p>
	3 - Afterwards there is the shipping by container for a large number but it will not be possible immediately.
