<p>I recently found out Rei had called in to Voice of Reason several months ago, on a show Merlin Miller was a guest at. It was interest to hear his perspective and everything, but when she called in, I noticed something weird with her speech.</p>
<p>I'm not the best with British accents, but I've known Yorkies, Ulsterians, etc. and her manner of speech seemed a bit... "Pip-pip, cheerio and all that." I'm not sure what an east midlands accent <em>should</em> sound like, so I was hoping you'd have a better ear for her accent.</p>
<p>At the very least, her manner of speech was a bit manic. Pressured speech, unnecessary repititions, somewhat stilted...</p>
<p>Think you could check it out?</p>
