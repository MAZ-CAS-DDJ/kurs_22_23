	I hear you, my last two years of high school was pretty much just showing up and checking boxes on the graduation checklist, the learning stopped sophomore year when I finished all my math courses. Public education is a joke, they didn't even teach us how to fill out a W2. They probably expected everyone to either hop on the welfare train or go to community college, rack up a bunch of student debt, get a useless degree, and then hop on the welfare train.

	I even remember in junior year they organized what I called the "White Guilt Field Trip." I didn't actually go, but from the video presentation they showed the day before, it seemed like the most kosher thing you could imagine. They even had a bunch of old baby boomer race traitors saying shit like "I had no idea how oppressive my ancestors where to other peoples." I didn't know nearly as much as what I know now, but something about it seemed very odd. Looking back, it may very well have been the catalyst for me finding fascism.

	So in a strange way, I guess I should be thanking my local ZOG indoctrination center for trying to shove its agenda down my throat so hard that it actually woke me up.
