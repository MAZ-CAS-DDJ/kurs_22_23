	Hungarians are made up of local tribes that were assimilated and formed what we know today as Hungarian nation. Croats today are literally Serb converts, they have nothing in common with historic Croats.<br />
	Regarding the sources, I can only give you things based on our language. Many slavic linguists did indeed verified that most of modern Croatia (Dalmatia and Slavonia) speak Shtokavian dialect that is characteristic for Serbian language. Croats speak Kaikavian dialect, which today is almost non-existent since back in 19th century when creation of Croat nation has begun they adopted Serbian literature language as their own (note that Serbian literature language is common folk Serbian language that was adopted as literature one by Vuk Karadžić).<br /><br />
	Germans and Hungarians were for the most part purged by the communist regime, both ethnicities resisted any form of assimilation. There are ton of hungarians in Vojvodina today who don't know Serbian, only Hungarian, for example. So no, it's very unique thing to take away a million or two people from one nation and culturally brainwash them into something new.<br /><br />
	I'm not selective, I just don't care because I never studied whos living space is in Panonia. If I would guess I'd say that Romanian, Magyar and Slavic people have a right to it, but luckily the only aliens in that territory are gypos.
