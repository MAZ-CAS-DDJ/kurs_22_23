<p>Could write something up on them but i am still reading through The ANM story, i am sure, if Ratbag wasn't so busy, he'd do a much better job of summarizing them up for a thread in historic movements. I have scanned VT's book and put it up in the External Materials Archive, if your interested in giving that a read. I think that pretty much covers most of our Fascist movements for now i would like to find out about NZ fascist/ns history a bit more though, they do have a decent Nationalist party/scene i think.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
