<p>Hi, I'm zeiger, the maintainer of the fascist archive. You're welcome to post some materials to the archive if you wish. The link to the archive is at the top of the page.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute some of your dutch books to the archive, I will create a dutch section for you. The password for uploading files is ironmarchy.</p>

<p>That's wonderful, I was actually planning on making a thread where I wanted to ask you to make a section called <em>Netherlands/Flanders</em> under <em>Fascism</em>, I was waiting until all the files had loaded on the Internet Archive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.org/details/dutchliteratureironmarchlarajantimony" rel="external nofollow">Suggested Dutch Literature</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I made a small collection of 29 files, 2 of these are in English. They are Fascist and Nationalsocialist works made during and after the war.</p>

<p>Okay, the section is made:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Just click "attach" and upload your files. Please make sure the name format is good, like "author - title.pdf"</p>
