<p>First off, welcome to the boards, I'd like to pick your brain a bit about your ideology, if you don't mind.  My completely ideal world seems very similar, so I am intrigued.  </p>
<p>First thing I would like to know is why you don't go full Western Imperium on your ideal empire?  What kind of power would the statelets have in relation to the empire as a whole?  Also, I saw you listed Indo-European in your list of groups included in the empire would this include Indians and Persians?</p>
<p>On a personal note, I tip my hat to you for being a Breton nationalist.  We don't have very many people here willing to argue the case for stateless nations.  Do you speak the Breton language?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
