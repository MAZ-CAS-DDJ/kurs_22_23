			The Arab peoples are classed as Caucasian (i.e. white) and the Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) is described in the Hadith as "a white man" who ruled over black slaves, and the Satan is described as a black man!

	Oh yes I have watched that man's video before. He has an obsession with proving islam wrong. I did hear of Prophet Muhammad (saaw) being white before. I do agree that most Arabs would classified as white. Lol I don't think Satan is the black man, there are some shitty black people and of course whites are superior. I was brought up Muslim but the man I'm with was Catholic (his parents were too but pretty much atheists since they are non practicing). But yes I have seen in a few research that Arabs have the same bone structure  (skull) as whites.
