<p>Rockwell's speech Nazism the only answer to communism is fantastic too.</p>

<p>There are a couple of other speeches in there too.</p>
<p>This time the world is probably the thing which made me really appreciate the person Rockwell was and relate to him while White Power just had me agreeing with him.</p>

<p>Good link, perfect stuff to listen to when exercising/winding down before bed. Just downloaded a copy of TTTW  (<a href="https://archive.org/details/ThisTimeTheWorld_37" rel="external nofollow">https://archive.org/details/ThisTimeTheWorld_37</a> - an old 2nd edition scan) too.</p>

<p>White Power is something I'm not reading consecutively- dipping into random chapters at a time, and I get what you're saying. You can tell Rockwell was a former marketing man- he's got a convincing turn of phrase &amp; skilled writing style. The chapter on National Socialism is probably the most succinct, comprehensible description of the worldview I've ever read, totally clarifies how natural/rational it is in a way I haven't seen elsewhere. Hitler's great, but Mein Kamp's a denser read- much more depth, but also more effort's required to absorb it. The two complement each other pretty well as a result.</p>

<p>Cheers again.</p>
