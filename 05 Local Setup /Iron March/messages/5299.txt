<p>Thank you for liking my introductory post here in Iron March.</p>
<p>The prime reason, however, for this message is to advise you that I joined the NBU, member #1514, last week. My name is Simon Iredale.  I see that you are the National Officer for the USA and, having asked the NBU (Sam &amp; Gary) by e-mail for your e-mail address to reach out to you but heard no reply, I found you on fb.  I sent you a message with a brief introduction and asking how I could help the movement, albeit from NJ. That fb message probably went to your "Other" message file on fb and, I imagine, that you have not yet seen this - I sent it over the past week-end.  </p>
<p>I joined Iron March after the fb message and, since seeing your like of my introduction here, I put the proverbial 2 &amp; 2 together and, believe anyway, you are the USA National Officer. Hence, this message via Iron March.  </p>
<p>I would appreciate your reply to me either here or via fb as I am eager to do more, however small, for the fascist cause, be it in the UK or here in the US. For all I know, and hope, there is a fascist movement in the US that you perhaps run or are a member of that I may also join and contribute to.</p>
<p>Hail comrade!</p>
