<p>Nice, nice to know of another uploading site too, I've been using hidemyass lately. Love the pic with the bottle of booze and sat on Stalin's head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I heard you wanted to get back into exercising, same here, I've been out the loop for a few months and it's starting to show, my mate's a full time juicer and he's making me jealous as fuck. Steroids is the way. I'll just give you the info I gave someone else here and let you decide what to do with it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm not sure if you know the basics or not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'll break it down quickly.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>There are different types of steroids.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Acne can happen but in most cases it doesn't, it's another myth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trenbolone acetate will treat acne about as effectively as accutane, steroids which don't cause acne would be Dianabol in doses around 30mg, and a very slow releasing testosterone like cypionate. But like I said these are just the drugs where it isn't a risk even with other drugs where it is, you're probably not going to get any acne if nothing more than a bump or two.<br /><br />Some get test shrinkage, some don't. Either way, shrinkage is not permenent and it doesn;t interfere with you having kids. My best mate is a juicer and he's got kids all over the world probably, he's got 4 here alone and he's only 2 years older than me but he is a bit richer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You actually have to put in harder work on steroids to get the full results. Sure you can take steroids and still put some muscle on with barely doing anything out the ordinary, such as just doing your day job and probably eating a bit better - it's a big waste of money doing that though. You have to work out or its not worth the risk, but your workout regime does not really matter. Just lift shit and do whatever else, I do weighted pull ups and swimming. If you have physical work do nothing. Use Test E, not P if you want to do it, E is much better and you have to inject less.<br /><br />You better eat like an obese person while roiding, around 3000-4000 calories would be good. Unfortunately it seems there is no real solution for cheap, high calorie protein sources. In fact it would be cheaper and more effective to just purchase steroids and use those with an average diet, one 250mg vial of test prop is pretty cheap and that should last a steroid virgin of 160-175 lbs about two weeks. Maybe take some dianabol for the first week to kick start the testosterone or just use test suspension instead. Be sure to buy a whole bunch of them for cheap.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For interest's sake and dispelling bullshit myths about roids here's the data concerning people on steroids with no exercise routine gaining more muscle on average than people not on steroids with an exercise routine. Much more.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/D93Re54.jpg" alt="D93Re54.jpg" /></p>

<p>Truth be told though, you can learn as much as you need about steroids from simply using google. Google may actually be the best resource out there. You can simply google "&lt;steroid&gt; + profile" to get a good idea about the steroid you would be interested in. You can also replace profile with "log" to find literally hundreds if not thousands of logs from people who have taken the drugs you're thinking about taking and written everything down in an online journal. Some of these threads/logs go back ten years, some even more.<br /><br />You can learn 'all the basics' in a couple of days of googling, without a doubt. Breivik wrote some stuff aswell:</p>
<blockquote class="ipsStyle_spoiler"><p><span>&gt;From 2083</span><br /><br />Miscalculation 1: After testing; I have concluded that DBOL can be counterproductive to<br />use for battle. The reason is that up to 50% of your weight gain is water/liquid retention<br />which does little for your strength and agility and only adds more weight for you to<br />“carry”. This can be countered by switching DBOL as the primary steroid with f example<br />testosterone propionate (test prop) as you will only get a fraction of the water retention<br />with the latter. Alternatively, you may use Aromasin in combination with DBOL to<br />suppress the “bloat” (water retention). This will ensure that 80%+ of your gains are<br />muscles with minimal water retention. You can further reduce the “water-gain” by<br />limiting sodium (salt) and carb intake. Another option is to use DBOL for the first 3 weeks<br />and Winstrol for the last 3 weeks in order to get rid of the water while still keeping your<br />muscle gains. There are tens of various combinations out there with multiple brands and<br />types of steroids. Just find an option that suits you. The important thing, after all, is to<br />biologically enhance your physique in order to ensure that you have the optimal chances<br />to succeed in the operation.<br /><br />A quick guide to oral anabolic steroids<br />The use of anabolic steroids will significantly increase your agility, speed, strength and<br />endurance. A good alternative in this regard is Winstrol (stanazolol) in tablet form (liquid<br />form is slightly better if you don’t mind needles, which I do). Winstrol is one of the most<br />popular drugs considering the fact that it has very few side effects (androgenic side<br />effects are almost zero). It also increases your metabolism which will help you lose body<br />fat while building muscle mass. Anavar works as well, but I wouldn’t recommend<br />Dianabol, Halotestin and Maxibolin which are designed for ”bulking your muscles”. EPO is<br />another drug that enhances endurance.<br />Steroids are usually taken in 6 week cycles followed by a 6 week break. Make sure that<br />your operation is within a cycle.<br />Winstrol specification<br />Winstrol is an orally or injectable applicable steroid with a great effect on protein<br />metabolism. Winstrol (Stanozolol) is a derivative of testosterone and has very strong<br />anabolic and androgenic properties. Winstrol has a great effect on protein metabolism<br />and promotes protein synthesis. This effect manifests itself by creating a positive<br />nitrogen balance, supporting the building up of protein and thus skeletal muscle mass.<br />Winstrol also induces an improved sense of well-being. Appetite stimulation, increased<br />muscle mass, increased bone density, increased red blood cells are the common effects<br />of Winstrol.<br />End note: I ended up with DBOL and winstrol tabs. Yes, I am aware of the fact that there<br />are much better products out there but these will have to suffice. I will do 4 weeks with<br />DBOL followed by 2 weeks of winstrol, obviously in combination with hard training and an<br />appropriate diet consisting of a minimum of 200g protein per day (prot powder) etc. My<br />training program will consist of 50% strength and 50% cardio. I ordered the DBOL+<br />Winstrol tabs from an online store called “Alinshop” who offers “paperbol”, a new shipping<br />method for sending tablets safely through the mail. The essence of the method is the<br />following: tablets are glued vertically on a sheet of paper, resulting in a thickness of no<br />more than 0,2 cm. As such, the shipment is sent as a thin “letter” and avoids the custom<br />scrutiny reserved for “packages”. It is a highly efficient technique used to send anabolic<br />tablets safely through the Western postal systems. I received my “letter” without any<br />problems with a total of 3000 tablets of DBOL and Winstrol. Alinshop has its office in the<br />Balkans. I intend to do at least more test cycle and one last “operational cycle”.<br />Countering the water/fluid retention from DBOL<br />The problem with DBOL is that 20-50% of your weight gain is from water/fluid retention. Fluid<br />bloats the muscles and adds little or no strength gain at all. If you can control the water retention<br />with Arimidex or Aromasin, DBOL is fine and you will experience exceptional muscle/strength gain<br />with little water retention.<br />Aromasin (exemestane), the best<br />Arimedex, the second best<br />Use aromasin at 0,25-5 mg per day (drink a lot of water to prevent dehydration)<br />Aromasin is better because it's easy on HDL, it will free up test lower shbg, can cause muscle gains<br />and is much better tolerated and more effective (suppression profile wise) as compared to<br />Arimidex. You will find very few people that prefer Arimidex over Aromasin.<br />Non-steroid means to avoid too much water/fluid retention.<br />· Reduce your sodium/pottassium intake as both are potent regulators of fluid retention. Sodium is salt<br />(sodium chloride) and f example tuna fish is loaded with sodium).<br />· Regular H2o (water) intake is a good idea as it help keep the system flushed.<br />· Watch carbohydrate intake as too much carbs will lead to fluid retention. It takes 300-400ml of water<br />to store 100g of carbs.<br />Generally, if you run a test prop cycle (testosterone propionate), instead of DBOL you will get little<br />to no water retention. The drawback (if any) is that you have to take “test prop” through syringe<br />and needle as its half life in pill form prohibits oral intake.<br />End note: after testing both DBOL and Winstrol tabs extensively I am likely to go with WIN on the<br />mission as it will lessen the water retention significantly. I may use 1 week of DBOL (10 mg tabs x<br />4 times per day) followed by 1-2 weeks of Winstrol (10 mg tabs x 4 times per day) prior to<br />operation. I may increase the dosage to 50 mg per day since I didn’t notice any side effects while<br />using 40 mg. Just remember; never use alcohol when on steroids and always couple the above<br />with 3 tabs of Milk Thistle per day for additional liver protection.</p></blockquote>

<p>There's a lot of bunk info about steroids out there. I tried to cover as much as I could in general here. For specifics you'll have to do a bit of googling. As for actually getting the stuff, the best bet is asking a huge guy in the gym, don't be scared they've all been there; it's as if you were buying any other kind of drugs. Or you could look on topix.com as I'm sure you know about and various other websites but you have to be careful buying online, it's easy to get ripped off with steroids.</p>

<p>Take a look at these as well.</p>

<p>I know I tell a lot of people about high fat and low carb diets, but when competing all the athletes are on high carb diets for the extra burst of energy. Just check out Michael Phelps' and Rick Hatton's diets. When I was boxing my trainer plied me with Lucozade and snickers. They have a stimulant effect. Junk food diets along with cocaine, striped socks, synthesizers and courage were the foundations of the golden era of sporting, the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

<p>Most athletes, weightlifters and boxers in particular follow junk food diets very often but when asked about nutrition they would 'advise' people the normal stuff that most nutritionists go along with, same as they'll turn around and tell you they're not juicing. It's not the exact healthiest way but carbs do work if you're in competition.</p>
