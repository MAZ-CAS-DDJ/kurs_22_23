	The question of authority and autonomy is a crucial one, but usually we are overcomplicating it. Everybody should serve Truth the best way he can which is by his own means, his own nature. It's really that simple (well, under the ideal circumstances at least). According to this principle, I am both for Imperialism and autonomy, if the former is interested in uniting rather than in unifying and the latter applies only to the way we serve, not who we are serving (otherwise we will end up with Relativism, Liberalism, Democracy et cetera).

	I don't know jackshit about the history of Brazil, so it is more than possible that I am wrong about the Integralists, but I see them similar to my ancestors who have united their seven tribes to become a powerful nation. Though they weren't as diverse as the peoples living in Brazil, and this happened in a more Traditional era; I still think that there could be a legitimate basis for a similar action in Brazil, for despite the fact of the various backgrounds, these people were living under the same rule since 500 years. Forced mixing sounds too much, and I would rather see a cooperation of culturally intact groups than a mixture, but in this way you always have to count with the enemy using 'divide et impera', and if they were able to break up a 1000 year old country like Hungary they will easily deal with Brazil. How about some kind of Federation?

	What do you mean by that it's almost like Pizzagate? If those cultists are just half as Satanic as those motherfucker paedos they ought to be purged.
