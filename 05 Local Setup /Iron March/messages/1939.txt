<p>Well i understand that the so called socialists are having gone too far, though that socialism in the west is just pussyfied socialism. Real socialism is found in USSR (under Stalin), NS Germany, DPRK, and other socialist countries (not the ones found in the west). There are socialist tendencies in my country, but not really. Socialism here is being poisoned by npa bastards, liberals, plus nation traitors (e.g. the old nobility like the cojuangcos and aquinos), are trying to poison my country further by being pro-usa. </p>
<p>True, our capital is under a flood. I Blame population overgrowth+politicians for letting the forests be cut.</p>
<p>We are trying to check if my house is under danger. So far, nothing bad's happening in my house. My parents live in Brunei, as legal migrant workers, of course.</p>
