<p>I read the manifesto and "liked" the blog too. The style of writing is very potent, and rather stirring. As for your ideas and such, I'm impressed by them, you seem to have taken your peoples specific, and unique, needs in to account and built an appropriate nationalism for them. Although I will add, "Eternal representative of Anglo-Saxon" is unhelpful. I assume you're referring to America? There's nothing Anglo-Saxon about the United States, and as an English nationalist, I'm trying to do my bit in preserving the real meaning behind the demonym.</p>
<p>Regardless, I particularly appreciate your socialist measures, built within a nationalist context, "<span style="color:#d3d3d3;"><span style="font-family:Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Total elimination of usury, by the extinction of interest loans", amen, haha!</span></span></span></p>
<p>Are you involved in any kind of direct, political activities?</p>
