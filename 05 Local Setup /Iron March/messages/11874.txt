<p>I swear that word starts to rub me the wrong way worse each time I hear it but again because of its source. Non-fascist TRS types seem to be using it to memefy fascism in a kind of self-defense against the "you're just nazis/fascists" liberal accusation. "Hurr durr it's a discussion terminating term so let's make a meme out of it, haha, libs call everyone fascists so lets jokingly say we're fashy lol we're not entirely alright with democracy, that's so fashy - that'll kick the wind from their sails". In other words its used by people who are actually afraid of being called that so they have to turn it into a joke to defend themselves as opposed to being actual Fascists and not flinching at being called what they claim to be proudly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And you're right, there is a different scene in yankyland, it's way more fractured with nothing really good in the works, it's been a quagmire that has been growing worse year in year out for a while now, we've been trying to get our own yanks on the forum to actually get to work on something real but nothing noteworthy has been produced yet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The reason we got this supposed increase of "fashy" narratives is simply because the goal post of progressivism has been moved so now yesterdays progressives become today's regressive shitlords and so some of those people suddenly find themselves on the "right" to the new liberal standard but they are not in fact on our side, they just want things to go back to the way shit was just before the SJW's appeared and then with varying degrees of looking further back but never quite back enough. Real fascists are still a dime a dozen, it's just that we suddenly find ourselves in the same basket as all these other people who became dispossessed by their own narrative. But from our viewpoint, our fascist standard, they are all still on our left.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don't mind the idea of a bigger pool of people to find still unconscious fascists in, but in that sense the alt-right's purpose is simply that of a vetting space where we separate the fascists from the useless, whereas the alt-right sees itself as a kind of growing coalition that maybe seeks cohesion, so the attitudes are vastly different. I don't support the vast range of views notion, Mein Kampf "Strong Man is Mightiest When Alone" - the Alt Right to me is mostly made up of cowards seeking strength in numbers so they are ready for compromise so long as everyone involved are "fashy" which is actually defined by the enemy and not them, since they let the enemy call everyone to it's right fascists. To a communist a social democrat is a fascist, but to a fascist a social democrat is a communist because they might as well be from a hardline perspective of either fascism or communism because they strictly outline what they ARE and everything that isn't with you is against you. So the alt-right is a collection of everyone who got called "fascist" by the progressives by virtue of them not being progressives or not as progressive as the modern day progressivists, but that doesn't make them Fascist by our own standards so we cannot allow them into our ranks nor can we join their coalition. If someone wants to accept our ideals and join us that's one thing because we keep our hardline position and strength. Coalitions are built on compromise, compromise is where the Truth goes to die. Hence why Fascists cannot earnestly participate in this kind of thing but can only stand by and scope out potential fascists who can join our ranks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If TRS develops into full blown fascism that's great but since its a crockpot of the dispossessed which allows for discussion and various opinions it can go either way, either it becomes a platform of cohesion through compromise in which case its a lost cause or it manages to figure its shit out like we on IM had done but that took us years. Only other possibility is a split where some people figure shit out and the others remain delusional, in which case the latter will die off and the former will join outright fascism.</p>

<p>Long rant aside, like I said I'm up for it but what you see above is a good indication of what you'll get from me in the chat. </p>

<p>I'm actually away from home right now and can't use skype but I will be returning home within the next 24 hours, so I'll add you as soon as I'm able. </p>
