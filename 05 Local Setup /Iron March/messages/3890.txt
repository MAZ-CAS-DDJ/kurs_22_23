<p>Are your contacts in Indiana part of NSM88? I hope not, I have bad blood with them.</p>
<p>I was baptized on the Theophany.</p>
<p>Also, even though I'm in total disagreement with NatAnarch I'd like to at least collaborate you as a fellow Orthodox Christian if nothing else. Are there any other Orthodox Christians in the movement? I may have something you'd all be interested if that is the case.</p>
