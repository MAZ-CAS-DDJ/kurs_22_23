	Awesome to hear from you again. Haha, I love your sense of timing. I have that knack for looking out for dates and numbers too.

<p>
	It's fine. Eleven or not, I can wait. I remember predicting this type of outcome happening earlier on too. After all, the only way for our messages to develop would have been either for them to become ever more complex or to die out. Either up or down. (And lol, to think that this giga-mail was the offspring of that simple "Question about Tradition" from way back in the beginning. It's like a volcano erupted. Oh well, you did request the full 9000, remember.)

	Alright, I see. Yeah, that's a good plan to contact them. Take your time of course. Who do you have in mind by the way? Slavros and Zeiger and those guys?

	Also, I was curious—I noticed when you weren't online for those two weeks and was wondering what could have happened to you at that time. I initially thought you could be on a vacation or a pilgrimage or something, but since it was boring I guess it was probably work-related stuff after all.

<p>
	And yeah, I was worried about that possibility too. The emails will come in handy in case anything happens. I just sent you a message that's like "Akhenaten + Genghis = Hitler."
