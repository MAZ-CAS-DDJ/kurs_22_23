<p>Finns are so based! I tried learning the language a few years ago, but alas it is seemingly impossible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm so sorry to hear that, I know you were excited. But good that the party was ok.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have a lot of plans! Tomorrow I'm going early to see my friends, they built a big sculpture on wheels and are racing it through the city. I'll either be at the community college taking english to get my diploma or at work most days, but I'm going camping a lot too. My dad will be taking me to a family reunion later on, and my mom and I are going to Maine. I can't wait for Maine, we'll be on a farm and I'll have some real work to do!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aside from leaving for Portland, what are your plans?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Btw I saw this incredibly beautiful little girl at work, blue eyes and dark hair like us, I got the daddy feels and I've been listening to this wayyyyy too much</p>
