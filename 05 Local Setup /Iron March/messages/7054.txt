<p>My opinion is simple--the first world nations of the world should help and aide the third world nations to help them become self-sufficient no longer dependent on the foreign aide the receive today to maintain their existence. I do not support any expansion into these thrid world nations just because they have been burdened by colonialism it does not mean we can subject them to our rule. It is their nation, not ours.</p>
