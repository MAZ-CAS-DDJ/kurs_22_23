<p>I read your post about Tradition and Fascism. Great post,  I really enjoyed it. It made me want to try and read some Evola. I'm aware he has to be read selectively because of his sperg fanbase etc. </p>
<p>I'm just not sure where to start, he has a lot of books. I was curious as to what book you'd recommend to start with.  Thanks. </p>
