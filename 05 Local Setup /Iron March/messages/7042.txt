<p>Sounds awesome. My mum and dad went to Yugoslavia for their honeymoon and said it was a beautiful country; which part of it I'm not sure so I'll have to ask them where exactly they went, a shitload of jellyfish they swam amongst apparently though - don't know how many clues that gives lol.</p>
<p>I've always found Czech, Slovakian, Serbian and Bulgarian women to be hot, 3 girlfriends ago was Serbian, going for a Pole next; I think they're the best thing to happen to England in a long time, I don't dislike Polish immigration that much, I dislike the companies who choose to hire ONLY Poles; all other immigrants are shit tier, the Slovaks we get either end up being Gypsies or the dumbasses unfortunately. Like you said the Germanic slavs and Slavic-Germanic mixes are the best. Hitler's position on Slavs and slavic countries are extremely misunderstood. I posted a good article and narrowed it down to the core pretty well about a year ago when I put that sandnigger InTheRight in his place when he questioned their "whiteness". I feel that most of my childhood friends and myself would not feel out of place amongst many slavs, they have a fun loving attitude. With the exception of the Western part of Russia and other isolated parts I don't consider them as Europeans or even allies to Europe and it disappoints me a little when people instantly think of Russia when the word slav is said.</p>
