	Hey lad, I'm from near London myself, what's <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> London like? They don't seem to post as much content as the rest of the <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> wings do. How was the meeting? I'm buried in my A levels so I don't have much time, but come the summer holidays and I should be able to join and participate.
