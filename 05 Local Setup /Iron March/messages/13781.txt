	Was in cancer as forum drama should be, i think it's been taken down though
</p>

<p>
	Apparently Weisse was confronted on his Conversion to Islam and went on to take about how Hilarious the situation in Europe is and that Islam will be triumphant and that he wasn't a National Socialist anymore, als that Muhammad fucking a 9 year was ok because "lol people did shit like that back then".
</p>

<p>
	Also talked about how he planned to convert Atomwaffen into and islamist organization and that he had "converted everyone he needed"
</p>

<p>
	So he and a member of Atomwaffen who dd covert were banned and Slavros said IM was Cutting ties to AW until Odin returned and sorted this shi out.
</p>

<p>
	At first most of the AW members on here were butthurt and complain about being "betrayed" by IM or some dumb shit.
</p>

<p>
	Then it largely devolved into butthurt members calling Slavros and Uzbek, until two members of AW said that weisse had stepped down as temp leader and they would delegate leadership until Odin returned.

	Slavros, Noidberg, Natt or Another American could tell you more
