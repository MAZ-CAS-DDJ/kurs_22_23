<p>This happened during my hippie occult days when I was a loser teen rebelling against my parents. I tried AP one day and succeeded and felt/saw/hear/taste this sort of ball thing. It felt like an LSD trio but I was a stupid guillible thinking it was "a message from the gods". Now that I'm Christian and grown out of my stupidity, when I look back at this experience, I can tell you this is probably an evil defiant satanic materialism, (like Oakleaf said "lower materials trying to reach the higher immateria"l). I think it is our mind is hallucinating immaterial concepts and rebelling against the God ordained segragation of immiaterial and material orders.</p>
<p>What was the "ball" that you saw? And what sandstone? </p>
