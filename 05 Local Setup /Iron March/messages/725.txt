<p>I only wish to apologize for my offenses in the past. I have indentified my views somewhat similar to yours. I'm a progressive, but opposed ot Socialism. I believe in a State- Direct Economy and I wish to protect private property. They're several patriotic rich men in our country, something the left-wingers refuse to believe. I'm a Reactionary and we should always be opposed to anything revolutionary which could be a threat to our country. Never forget that the Revolutionary Socialists have the insanity to sell information to our enemies (russia and china) only to persue their own opportunistic goals. Capitalism must remain in our country, it is a tradition. And I will not see it destroyed. With the Patriot act and the NDAA in effect, it should give the Federal government the excuse to arrest Socialists and -quasi-communists for suspected treason.</p>
