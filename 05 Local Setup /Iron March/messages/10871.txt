<p>Howdy! Unfortunately, Im in Los Angeles right now. Its a shame there aren't any decent and active organizations in SoCal that aren't just skinhead groups. Though I know NSM used to float around here. If you're ever in Los Angeles, DM me on here if you want to meet up. Ill do the same next time Im down in SD!</p>
