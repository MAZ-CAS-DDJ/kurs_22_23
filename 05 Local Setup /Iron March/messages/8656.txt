<p>Wouldn't mind checking out the League of Rights stuff, haven't really read anything of theirs before- just a few things here and there about them being evil anti-semites etc.</p>

<p>Was also getting antsy about the lack of threads in the Shrimp Bunker, but as I said I'm not in the best position atm to do stuff irl. ANZAC Day's almost a month away tho &amp; I should easily have my shit together by then, it's a public holiday anyway so there's no excuses not to get out- &amp; stickering/stencils should be easy especially as that's what I've been wanting to start off with. Is 'Australian Action' the name we settled on for the Aussie IM Chapter? Don't mind it at all &amp; if we have a decent logo and at least 2 or 3 poster/sticker slogans (that 'JVT Was Right' one is ace) we should be golden to plaster up some decent spots. Making sure the AusAction logo is on everything we throw up is important too I reckon, Jack mentions the importance of branding all your propaganda a few times in his book. In the meantime I've typed up a whole bunch of quotes from The ANM Story, just waiting for Slavros to split that thread for us so I can put them in there- and maybe we can steal some of those for poster/sticker slogans.</p>

<p>And yeah, it's a pity the only other two Aussies we've got on IM want to leave the country. The NT guy seems alright but I just don't get that "I want to live in Europe!" attitude, seems weird to me you could be born &amp; raised here and have no attachment to the land at all. Can't tell if that's the fault of multiculturalism fucking up peoples' sense of identity or just some personal issue, lol. Anyway, cheers fellas.</p>
