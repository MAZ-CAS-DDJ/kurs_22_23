<p>It's a pleasure to meet you. I thought that your username looked familiar as well. I will enjoy the forums, I just had a slight issue. Who was the person who was flamming me on my Black Corps post? I have nothing against them but I find it really disrespectfull as I was actually trying to take the pledge. I hope that you have the time to help me out with this, thank you.</p>
