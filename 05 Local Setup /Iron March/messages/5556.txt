<p>Hi, Goliath;</p>
<p>Yes, I'm a reconstructionist.  Asatru, to be specific.  Are you Greek?  It was exploring my German heritage that lead me to Germanic branches of paganism.</p>
<p>I live in Central California at the moment, although my wife and I are looking into relocating somewhere more white and less liberal.  What's it like in Oregon?  I've only been there once, about 20 years ago, in the Klamath Falls area.</p>
