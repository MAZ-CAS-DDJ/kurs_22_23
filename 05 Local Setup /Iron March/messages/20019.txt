	hey, I'm in Europe so I don't have access to wickr until I am back. I spoke with the guys here, more people involved now that the guy I was originally buying from is in jail, had to improvise - bad news it will be drastically more expensive, good news is you will be getting  higher quality stuff - 9mm, .40, .45, etc, higher capacity magazines, etc. For 2000eur I can only do 2 pistols - remember things like this in France go for 1500-2000 for a single piece. I will throw in ammunition, magazines if the guy has them out of my own pocket for you because it's not what we originally agreed on. In a few days I have exact models for you and a day for you to be in Bosnia.
