<p>Hey mate, cheers for the reply. Firstly gotta say- you don't need a uni education to be able to communicate effectively, never felt any communication problems between us even if we're from different 'social classes' or whatever. Uni educations are overrated honestly, mostly they're there for indoctrination- that really isn't exaggeration at all, lot of what I learnt at uni was about sucking up, learning to craft a good argument/essay that catered to a particular establishment view, nothing to do with teaching independent/critical thinking. You can communicate fine without a degree, probably better in a lot of ways. Probably said this before but a lot of my really good friends in life have been 'bogans', they've got a way more down-to-earth attitude about things, don't usually have the PC mental straightjacket the middle-classes sport. Often they've way more common sense than the smarmy dickhead types I encountered at uni, who made me ashamed at times to be middle-class. So yeah, I reckon we'd get along fine, but I did have to throw the possibility out there. Mostly the reason I apologise for writing long PMs is because I'm a fucking wordy cunt &amp; imagine they'll piss people off, lol. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>And yep, you've hit the nail on the head about the problems with appealing to a youth culture in Australia. As Aussies our values hold that class doesn't matter, but it clearly does exist here- big divide between working class young lads &amp; middle class metro types, so divising a strategy that appeals to both would be a real challenge. I like your idea of linking an ideal 21st-Century Fascist to our old Henry Lawson types, I never really gave much consideration to leigitimising our ideas through linking them to figures the mainstream venerates (my head is too full of van Tongeren, lol) but it's a good one. AF has tried this a bit I guess (seen them quote Arthur Calwell &amp; Lawson articles on their site, for instance), my only issue with it is that a lot of young Aussies don't even know who these people are, which is shameful. Guess that could be worked into a propaganda campaign though- part education, part pushing a message, like: "This is who we were. This is what we've lost/forgotten. This is what we could become again."</p>

<p>Don't know anything about skins, but wouldn't mind meeting a few (so long as they're cool with 'metro types', <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" />), have a lot of respect for people who live the ideal 24/7. Atm I'm really keen to get my feet wet and start building connections, so skins are an option- as are the Saleam/AF meetings (or fuck, even Protectionist Party meetings maybe?), which I was aware of, but I dunno when the next one will be. Aactually been chatting to Saleam online and might get him on the blower soon too, I want to sound him out a bit to get a feel for whether AF is an option for joining. I agree with you the 'big tent' approach probably isn't necessary, and tbh I'm not comfortable with taking complete direction from Saleam even if he is a smart guy- but I'm pretty eager to network, &amp; AF seems the best option right now. Can always join, meet people, then fuck off &amp; do my own thing later. As for redpilling others- I know tonnes of people who should be open to NS- racist, homophobic, hate PC/feminists/etc.- but the stumbling block I'm finding is that politicised racism scares the shit out of them. Even my dad, who used to speak damn fondly of the ANM, seemed unsettled a while back when I played him an NS podcast from Renegade Broadcasting. Aussies seem way more open to One Nation style 'soft nationalism' than the real deal. I also do like the Stormer even tho I get some of the issues IM has with the fella running it. Really tho, the fact the site is run by <em>just one guy</em> is impressive to me even if he does sperg out on some topics, shows how much of an impact you can have on your own if you work hard enough. The real problem is IM are a tough lot to sell anything to, everyone here is smart as fuck and I feel a few steps behind in terms of ideological development. Kinda why I'm reading like crazy atm &amp; not getting too involved in the 'heavy' threads, gotta catch up first. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>Your idea of a magazine is fucking good. The one skill I do have is writing, and I could see putting together some kind of publication if we could find some artists or people to help with layout. Wouldn't have to be too fancy at first either, there was an anarchist zine floating round uni a while back which wasn't professionally done but was still impressive enough to take notice of, and Reaktion (ezine made by an old IM member) would also be good inspiration, that looked decent. I'm earning okay coin for now too so I'd be happy to sink a bit in to get it published decently enough so it didn't look like a pile of shitty printed A4. Love the ZOO angle too- nothing <em>too </em>serious, NS satire &amp; humour like the National Socialist Liberation Front used to make, that's the kind of stuff that'd make Aussie youth actually take notice. Maybe whack one or two serious editorials in the back for the student crowd. <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_wink.png" alt=";)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /> Combine that with stickers and pasting up posters/leaflets and we'd have a good start to a basic activist campaign. I imagine Ben &amp; NA'd be too busy to help us outright, but that guy knows his shit when it comes to organisation so I'm sure he'd be able to put us onto some good advice at least.   </p>

<p>Also- the union thing is something that's also bugged me for a long time- unions are basically the industrial wing of the ALP, which stopped representing the workers a long time ago. The country really needs independent unions, especially nationalist ones- European countries have always had competing unions representing different political parties/tendencies (the NSDAP had their own unions, so did the BUF and the Italian fash- all competing with anarchist unions, commie unions, social-democrat unions...) and it's fucking stupid the ALP has a total stranglehold on industrial action here. The problem with this approach though is I reckon it would be tough as nails to do- setting up a union I'm pretty sure costs more &amp; requires more signatories than setting up a party, you'd need to be able to maintain a constant membership to keep it viable &amp; have enough funds coming in to fight back against the inevitable ALP backlash. Personally don't think it's something that can happen until the nationalist movement here finds its feet and becomes more mainstream, but it'd be a necessity eventually- especially with people losing their jobs for being nationalists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyway, that's me. Although before I sign off- I agree we need an Aussie section, some of those European sections have been barely used &amp; it's messy as fuck shitting up your thread with stuff that isn't specifically about pre-1945 Aussie nationalism. I might mention it to Ben in the next week, see if he's okay with it &amp; maybe he can put in a good word to Slavros. Problem is there's only like 4 Aussies, but I'm convinced between the 4 of us we could generate more use there than is going on in some of those Slavic ones.</p>
