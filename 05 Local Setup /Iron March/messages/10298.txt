<p>Well actually I am sorta considering becoming a catholic of sorts. I can't ever abandon my ancestral gods and I will always be a pagan but I'm starting to really despise the Pagan community, even redpilled pagans are starting to annoy me. I don't see a future for the white race among most of these disorganized pseudo hippies, the best pagan group out there is the wolves of vinland and theyre a pretty small group. </p>

<p>I think if I can become a part of my local catholic churches community and redpill some people, meet good fellow whites and the whole time keep my paganism a secret it would be for the best </p>

<p>I'm sorry Wodan...</p>
