<p>ok, i started off as a communist, but as the authoritarian and Nationalist  type, but had to leave it because my parents forced me to do so. A year later i explored other forms of radical nationalism, like kahanism (im ashamed of it). Because of my love for authoritarian socialism, i also explored the form of German National Socialism (not the essence), and as you know it, Korean National Socialism (Juche), and its essence and form. Then i became a typical Bürger maggot (not the ass burger, as in the person who likes degeneration and decay), being a closet liberal and so on. But then when i truly became pessimist, i discovered Alexander slavros and Torture Device (hatred against the modern world, anti-capitalism once more, a reason to be a socialist once more, new type vs bürger, and metanationalism) which led me once again to Korean NS, and also, the ideas of Imam Khomeini, especially Islamic Revival and National rebirth for Iranians after what the shah had done. I'd rather be an autistic khomeinist/jucheist than be a bürger maggot.</p>
