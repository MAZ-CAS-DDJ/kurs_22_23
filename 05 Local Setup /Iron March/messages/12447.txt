<p>Sounds like your family is better than those typical liberal shits who let anything fly, so you've got that at least. Sounds like they'd be intolerant of paganism too though. As for self esteem, that can only be fixed through action. Gotta gain confidence by doing things, whether it's training in boxing or martial arts or joining an evil band of radical nazis like NA, etc. Something involving physical action and work, and camaraderie. Got long left on your university? If it's anything like Unis here, you'd be on your last year or close to it unless you were going for a master's or further degree.</p>
