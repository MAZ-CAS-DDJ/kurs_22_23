<p>That's amazing that you got to do that work in the Ukraine. I used to be quite enamored by the Catholic church until I was hit in the face with their hypocrisy and treatment of Leon Degrelle, who is one of my heroes.</p>
<p>I've never actually met someone who appreciates the WBC, though I will be the first to admit I do find their signs hilarious. The only issue I have with them is the fanaticism with which they pursue "fags." Now, I want to push homos into the ovens as fast as the next guy, but the WBC seems to be more of the Ken Ham, "God loves blacks and Jews more than whites" then real protestants.</p>
<p>Heres a great white Orthodox blog.</p>
