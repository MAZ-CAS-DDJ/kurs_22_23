			<span style="font-size:inherit;">He was a nut but he was at least fanatical. I'd prefer he had not snapped at his former comrades like a treacherous rat but rather thrown his life away striking at the system. I seriously can't understand why he would just throw his life away like that at 18 and have very little to show for his actions.</span>

	Yeah, IDK. Tbh I was pretty cheery when I first heard of what went down, even though it would be a death blow to AW. Of course at the time I hadn't known that the people he'd killed we're National Socialist. It really makes me wonder if things would've been different, had people been more understanding of his viewpoints. Of course there is no excuse for what he did, but it's an interesting thought. But what's more interesting is apparently they had bombs inside the house, along with radioactive materials, yet he didn't think to use them. He didn't even think to use his assault rifle!Â

	True, but destroying the system takes top priority. If we're destined to die, we should just get it over with, and if our women would be enslaved if we lost...many are enslaved already. We've just got to end this hell. We'll worry about what comes after, later.

			I have heard rape is being used by islamists in the west with the intent to make children. Like as a political tool. Could be propaganda though.

	I saw a Japanese documentary on ISIS where they showed some Arab guys talking about how they couldn't wait to get the Yazidi women, and that the ones with blue eyes were more expensive. They claimed that these people were ISIS, but they were raggedy and unkempt, and not in uniform. Didn't look like the ISIS troops shown off in their propaganda, but who knows the truth. Devon once said to me that he thought the Yazidis are devil worshipers, and so their slaughter is justified. Of course this is nonsense and I tried to tell him that. Perhaps I should've done it in a better way. I think that he thought I was mocking him, when I was shitposting. For one thing, I said that the devil was based. Lol
