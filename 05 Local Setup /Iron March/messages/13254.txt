	I love the silver shirts, just many people on here are accusing me of being like a cuckservative when that is far from the truth, I am basically a social conservative, American nationalist, agrarian with very slight libertarian leaning because I realize that many mixed race people look white and consider themselves white, in other words I believe in skin color as race over blood purity which I feel is impossible to acquire, I am just acting like an asshole on the threads because that is how I was greeted so I decided to play along.

	my economics are anti-usury, capitalism, with ideas taken from national-syndicalism/falangism such as Franco's vertical unions which I admire, many of my views are neo-confederate in nature.
