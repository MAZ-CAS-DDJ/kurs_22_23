<p>No, no. Its just that I'm a bit busy these days, final exams and stuff,  I probably forgot about it, sorry. </p>
<p>To be honest, it all depends on the context. If you mean like on this site, I don't think so, like I don't think that anyone cares about the extreme personal details of people that post here. </p>
