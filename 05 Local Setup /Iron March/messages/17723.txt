	I'm finding it difficult to find a doctrine on Fascism being revolutionary, or evidence of that being the case historically. I know it won democratically and its worker based, not by intellectuals or what not but mainly of the people. I know that the left doesn't have any monopoly on this but theres gotta be something to this beyond merely a modern outlook or adaption to bringing about organic states. I tried asking a couple people but no luck so far.
