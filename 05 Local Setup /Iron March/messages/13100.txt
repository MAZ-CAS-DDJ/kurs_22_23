	My mother had nine children. It used to be common for families to have 12 to 15 children. I have three younger sisters I want to work on recruiting them into a white survival group if one exists in future, I will see. My mum had six daughters all up. They are aged 28 to 4.

	I agree about living close by. It is sad that its hard to find women willing to be a part of such a community. I want to live near other families if I can. Or even other nationalists. I agree you cant just have your family. But its a good start until something develops.

	I personally like tasmania as a location. The lands cheaper too. I dont have support, no. I do everything alone. I stay away from mothers groups too. I just cant really stand the mothers. They all sit on their fat arses at picnic tables, eating cake while their kids violently act out towards other children uncontrolled.

	Most mothers rely on the opinion of the Government as the pinical of knowledge. I personally see the Gov entity as a threat, an  untrustworthy kosher source of information and control.

	I know how to bring my children up best. Not the Gov. They have no place in my life. Or very little. I have strong skeptical views on them.
