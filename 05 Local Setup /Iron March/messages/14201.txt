	Alright then. I really can't discuss the fact that I am a Fascist with anybody in my life and I can't discuss religion either. I made the unfortunate mistake this weekend of asking my dad is I could study neopaganism and "the Old Gods". To which he responded that I need to quote "stop with the fantasy stuff" and that to believe in the Old Gods is quote "ridiculous". To which I almost said but didn't (thank goodness I didn't), "Well some people think it is ridiculous to believe in Jesus Christ!" No offence btw. But, I let that go. I can't wait tell I graduate and move away and get my own place and I can put up whatever (a portrait Mussolini, yes I know, and a flag) of  I want and believe whatever I want.

	PS This is the flag I am going to buy next month, thoughts?

	Or maybe this one? What do you think about the flags?
