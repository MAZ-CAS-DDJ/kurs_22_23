<p>Nah, sorry. Just got out of major surgery and got home yesterday.I was thinking a breakdown of the Roman State and then taking each of those characteristics and seeing how they could be applied to a future Imperium Americana. Also, I <em>have </em>started on a piece on Pax Americana, Manifest Destiny, and the need to fill America's natural borders. Hideously sorry about the delays, mate.</p>
