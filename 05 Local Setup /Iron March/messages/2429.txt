<p>No roleplaying, we are not nationstates. Usually it is helpful to explain what you are talking about when making a new thread. Also, do not make a new thread for everything that enters your head, we have specific contribution threads for that. A thread is meant to be a conversation about something major.</p>
<p>When you post a film or pictures, you should link them to the thread.</p>
<p>This is basically the way things are done here. I am only notifying to help ease you in, but further ass burgers will be punished.</p>
