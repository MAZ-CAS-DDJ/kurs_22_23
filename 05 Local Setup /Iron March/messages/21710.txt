	I don't think its possible to not respect natural law - the system is operating on the base natural law - might makes right. They have the power so they are organizing society how they see fit - I dont think it has anything to do with natural law, rather with organic vs. artificial. They are organizing society artificially while we would organize it organically, which is our main problem with the system.
