<p>Well, I live with my parents and my siblings, it is never too lonely! It's not far from town, about a 15 minute run. It's a very beautiful part of the world, not too scary. I have always like the idea of living in a city though, being never alone with so much to see <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /><br /><br /><br />As for the tattoo, I like the idea. It is not something so silly or often-used as "1488 Hale Hitler Fascists Forever Mystical Swastika Jackboot Shaman". And it is Latin! You know I like latin.Â  It means something to you, and it does not look garish or strange. I like this.</p>
