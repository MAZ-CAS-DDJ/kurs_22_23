	The Nameless Book notes are mine, they're my research notes to eventually hopefully finally write the "Nameless Book" where I want to combine pretty much all of my research and explanations on fascism in one thing, though by now we produced enough materials in parts to really deliver the same point anyway so I may change direction with it somewhat.
