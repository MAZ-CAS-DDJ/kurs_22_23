<p>I must say that you're quite the honorable lady and I agree with you on a fair # of issues.</p>
<p>I'm also quite relieved to find another on here that doesn't care what someone else does in the privacy of their bedroom (I myself am Gay, and im not a flamboyant queer about it or attempt to raise a standard above it yet I feel most of the forum is a little too traditionalist on the issue in my honest opinon). Mosley did say after all "Liberty in Private, Obligation in Public"</p>
<p>If I can be of help for anything or if you need something answered please ask.</p>
