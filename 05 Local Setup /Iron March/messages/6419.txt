<p>Well yeah (he/you) uses that avatar. Best fucking tripfag /new/ ever had, summer 2012 were the glory days, and old tinychats with him were actually good. I used to browse heavily, so you have the admiration of Ben 'the Goyles' Noyles, though i use my real name these days.</p>

<p>Myrrysmies, our big finnish poster started as a newsman, he did cultural marxism simulator and ADFwiki (Red Weaboo Tranny).</p>

<p>Sorry if you feel you had a cold reception but Alex treats everyone like this, no matter how well established. You didn't have a very fleshed out introduction - if you had more to engage with, or told people who you were then many here would know you because we still all occasionally browse /new/-/pol/</p>

<p>I expected a cold reception, vetting is <span>necessary </span>and you do a good job of it. Plus I'm not a fan of special treatment. I like to stand on my own merits. IM is very good and is had a very unique layout. Good image.</p>

<p>Nice job on getting in HuffPo. A few guys present a Nat Soc banner outside Parliament and they shit bricks. Ha ha.</p>
