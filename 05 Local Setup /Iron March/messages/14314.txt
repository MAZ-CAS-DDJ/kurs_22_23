	They're all on welfare and selling drugs. You can always tell where they live because it'll be a dumpy ass house with a bunch of caddies and beamers parked out front. One of them used to live across the street from me, one day he even flashed around his Hi Point at the bus stop. He missed a couple months of school because he got shot in the face, dealing drugs on someone else's turf or some shit like that. Dindus are invariably horrible shots, so unfortunately he only got grazed. SWAT raided the place about a year ago, but he either got a slap on the wrist or someone else joined the family business, cause there's still a new caddie parked out front every few months.
