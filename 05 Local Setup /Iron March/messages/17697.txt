	Stats aren't the most important thing, what's important is consistency and working hard so you've got that sorted at least. Sounds good that you've got a coach. As for fat, you cannot lose fat in just one spot. You lose overall body fat. Crunches will not reduce your belly fat any more than any other exercise will. It all comes down to eating well and not overeating + doing some exercise to lose that fat. Crunches will strengthen your abs and that can help a bit but I'd say they're very overrated as far as exercises go. You should add deadlifts to one of those days, give your lower back a good workout.

	I do three workouts a week with 2 routines. Routine #1 is squats, benchpress and barbell rows. Routine #2 is squats, overhead press and deadlift. It's working out well so far. Each time I do the full sets of an exercise without failing I add 2.5kg to the weight, or 5kg in the case of deadlifts. The weight packs on fast.

	If you really wanna lose that gut, clean up your diet. No junk food, no bullshit snacks like candy or donuts. Just proper natural food, as much unprocessed as possible. Counting calories helps you work out how much you're eating and if it's too much.
