	Yeah, all we can do is try to reconstruct it the best we can. So have you actually played Varg's RPG then? You must have a tight group of m8s to do that then? I don't think you can play that by yourself. Otherwise, I probably would have done that a while ago. So, mind giving me a sample prayer to the old gods sometime? Just something I can use as a guideline. Especially one for getting tradical Aryan girlfriend  :) Ha ha, but seriously got any sample prayers (though keep the girlfriend prayer in mind though). So, which of Varg's books you recommend to start?
