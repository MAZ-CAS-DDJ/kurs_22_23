<p>Yeah, I converted about a year ago, haven't made any point of hiding it nor made any point of sperging over it and telling everyone. </p>
<p>But to be entirely honest, I've been questioning whether or not I actually believe in it lately. Kinda odd, one day I was fully convinced it was the truth, next day I just questioned everything and can't seem to reconvince myself. Anyway, I guess that was more information than you were looking for. Why do you ask?</p>
