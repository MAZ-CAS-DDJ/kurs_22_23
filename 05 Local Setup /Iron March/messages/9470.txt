<p>Well let's just say I have been keeping a plan for a local movement in the works, i've been intentionally not talking about it so as to appear with results rather than make long-winded announcements. I want IM to hear about us first on the news. I will try to give a general idea of what it will be like in a few words: Imagine a modern cross between the Silvershirts and NA, with a larger movement built around a small, dedicated Actiongroup who are required to attend meetings at least once a month and be as fit as Marines. This is part of the reason for my delay, to reach and surpass those standards myself until my current job ends, at which time i will have more time to recruit and spread propaganda. It will be a mini-community of its own, creating its own activity clubs and eventually militias. The overall plan of action is following Siege and the Futurism workshop, building the movement at strategic points in the rural areas across the country with the long-term ideology being laid out in my third sig post.</p>
