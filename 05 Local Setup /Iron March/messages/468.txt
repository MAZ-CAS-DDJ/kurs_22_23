<p>Ethno, you post a lot of topics and with some interesting material and for the most part spread them around the forum in more or less correct locations, but we thought that it might be better if you just made some one single topic and called it something like "Ethno's corner" or whatever and you can just dump all of that there.</p>
<p>So if you make that topic (General Discussions forum would be an appropriate place for it), I'll merge your two latest topics with it.</p>
