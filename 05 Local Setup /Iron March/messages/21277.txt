	I'm part of a group looking to start up something similar to National Action, with the same goals in mind. We have a long term plan and end goals, as well as a plan for a coordinated, planned announcement of our organization.<br /><br />
	The thing we have difficulty planning is between when we announce ourselves and the future when we already have plenty of members. I was researching National Action, and found the thread you originally posted in 2013. Unfortunately, <abbr title="National Action">NA</abbr> no longer exists in the Uk. That being said, what kind of tactics did you use after initially starting to not only get members, but to actually help the community?<br /><br />
	I look forward to your response.

<p>
	Thank you,
</p>
