	Alternativ Europa I think is the hungarian group. Do not give importance to the leader of Hogar Social, she is a girl and she doesn't look spanish, I can't believe how she continues there.

	I hope there'll be fascists in my university.

	Yes, the writters of Renacer Europeo are against Eurasianism, but they don't hate Russians, in fact there is a post in which they deny the Slavophilism myth of the nazis against the Russians.

	Hogar Social Madrid has very good relations with Casapound (and in fact HSM make a similar work to Casapound: food for the spanish poor people, also a home if you haven't...), but Casapound has good things and bad things: they have Che Guevara as a reference... I have been having a look about HVIM and it looks so good... I will ask some people.

	About our group it is still in process, but more or less we know what we want: an aesthetic more aggresive than the one of the social groups (such as HSM or Casapound) , with greater impact on the population, probably more similar to the HVIM Hungarian group.
