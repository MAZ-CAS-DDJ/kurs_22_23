	Hail!
</p>

<p>
	Kaci Mohand! Before my registration I have lurked on the forum and your introduction was one of my favourites! I will tell you why:
</p>

<p>
	I choosed this avatar because I think that our greatest task is to wipe out Chauvinism (this is really a big problem between Hungary and Romania). Now, one of the first elements of Chauvinism is something what I call "national-butthurtism". And you was writing about that in your introduction!
</p>

	"Only kikes and inferior people talk about reparation and tears and other buffoon things.... (Also I hate some algerian asking about reparation to France for occupied and bleeding Algeria, I prefer the dignity and pride)"
</p>

<p>
	There are no coincidences! ;)
</p>

<p>
	I will write an article about this topic, you will be very welcome to comment.
</p>

<p>
	God bless you! Salam Alaikum!
