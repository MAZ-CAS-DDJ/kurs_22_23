	Greetings!! 
</p>

<p>
	Well about my hobbies I like everything that you mentioned, but what interests me most lately is reading. Also sometimes I watch films (my favourite one is Gladiator) and I think the last videogame I played was The Witcher 3 (incredible).

	The greatest influences in my life (ideologically) have been: my Spanish teacher (an old falangist), some of the books that he ordered us to read for the school (such as "El Quijote"; "Discurso a las juventudes de España" or "El árbol de la ciencia"), and then when I was 15/16 I discovered some Twitter acounts (@espanolns ; @progretario ...) and the blog <a href="http://renacereuropeo.blogspot.com.es/" rel="external nofollow">http://renacereuropeo.blogspot.com.es/</a>
