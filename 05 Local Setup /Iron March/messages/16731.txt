	The more I talk to him the more I feel uncomfortable like I'm being watched , I have talked to him about Evola , he explained all of those things to me. He based this partially on Evola Traditional teachings, partially on his own theories . Honestly it seems like he's confused as to what he wants for the world. Are we trying to destroy it or build up Fascist societies, it feels like we're caught in a LARP limbo. If we destroy society first I honestly don't think we'll be able to salvage fascism at this rate , the people will turn to barbarism. Evola was right about the degeneration, but regardless I'm still uncomfortable having a prescence on a site thats been investigated and possibly watched by 3 police forces (UK,US,AUS) for certain possibly more countries. I'm gooing to cut my time on here like I said I need to focus on my self.
