<p>Firstly, I woud like to acknowledge the Admin's judgement on the issue I raised with Ethno-Nationalist from the previous PM.</p>
<p>On to what I wanted to talk about here:</p>
<p>I have been mulling on what Ferret wrote on his 'The posturing I see on leadership here' thread.</p>
<p>I have been thinking on how the leaders of this forum (Admin, Prop ministry, B-Corps) can exercise better leadership and organisation of the forum in the was Ferret described.</p>
<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to mention that I have noticed a worrying trend on this forum, and that is that most activity here seems directed at complaining about stuff, and not at the roots of the problems &amp; then comming up with solutions and debating them.</p>
<p>I feel that the forum leadership must, as Ferret put it, nudge things back into the right direction, that is, constructive thought &amp; discussion.</p>
<p>The means I propose to do this is through a forum newletter, created by the Prop Ministry &amp; Admins, distributed to the fourm population via email (voluntary subscription).</p>
<p>The newsletter would enable the forum leadership to bring specific topics to the attention of the foum population as well as initiate critical analysis &amp; solution generation among it.</p>
<p>I am currently working on a prototype, which I was hoping I could use as part of my own formal application to join the Prop Ministry (I will make the application when I have it ready). </p>
<p>I will send you a copy, hopefully within 30 hours of sending you this message.</p>
<p>PS: what is the acceptable means of sending you this document? It will be a Microsoft Publisher file.</p>
