<p>Alright I understand now.</p>
<p>Another user informed me of the mistake I made and I apologize for any insults that I made directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>I also apologize for bringing such a large idea to the table as my first real thread, I was told that was generally an idiotic move.</p>
<p>Would you happen to have any recommended reading so that my ideas are no longer based upon the works of media and games, and instead based upon facts from learned men?</p>
<p>I realise you have no reason to help me what so ever, however I hope that you can understand that I want to learn more.</p>
<p>I do not wish to remain ignorant any longer of the way the world should work.</p>
