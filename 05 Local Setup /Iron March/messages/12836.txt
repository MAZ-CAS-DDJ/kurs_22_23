	Well all you need to know is on the <a href="http://ropeculture.org/about-noose/" rel="external nofollow">About page</a>.

	And basically I proposed that we do a story on Skydas, could be done as just an interview but since we'll be introducing your group we can just write up a story with some interview elements introduced into it, so basically all you need to do is tell the history of the group, the style, the direction, plans and so on. Basically an exposé type article. If you want to help out with the project beyond that in some other capacity that can also be discussed.
