<p>I admire your commitment and efforts so very much and wish I had the same. Your book "The Next Anthology" I think should be the Bible of Fascism so to speak. Why isn't there a hard copy of it? I'd love to translate the book into Hindhi for my people. Do you know of any company willing to translate? My people are on the verge of waking up. Thanx a ton for all the work you've put into our cause. bless. There still maybe hope from the world. Stand strong and be brave, if you die before the Fascism takes place in Europe, I'll personally see to it that your name gets venerated in Europe and my country as well in the education system. Thank you very much. God bless the world and your Europe.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Me.</p>
