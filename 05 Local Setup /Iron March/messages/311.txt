<p>I would love to do that.  If its possible, type up a list of questions and send them to me, I am still here but rather haphazardly, my schedule is always erratic, this week we're doing all sorts of land navigation training and next week is a stinger missile live fire.  But, if it's something I can look at the questions, and type them out here and there, you'll definitely have a finished project that's much better than asking me and me popping off at the top of my head.  I'll answer anything you can possibly ask me.</p>
