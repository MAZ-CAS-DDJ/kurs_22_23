	Oh and the thing about the KKK is there are a shadow of their former self. They went from vigilantism and enforcing their concept of Americanism to being exclusively boomers and federal agents. There isn't even strict ethnic or religious requirements for many klans now a days. It is basically an umbrella group of WNs under the name of the klan, and when is the last time you've seen the klan do anything. It is WN larpfest now and nothing more.
