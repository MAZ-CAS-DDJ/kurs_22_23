<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could change <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/1679-on-the-front-lines-of-europes-independence/" rel="">the title of this thread</a> to something like "against islamification" or on the front lines of islamification..., as you are a moderator. The current title is somewhat misleading to those who do not understand it. And it is just better if it is changed. It gives people excuses for internet anger.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>
<p>Also, let me know if you were the wrong person to contact about this</p>
