<p>Tomorrow I'm attending a seminar session hosted by the Traditional Britain Group. Some of the 'Tracks' are being led by figures interested in the New Right such as John Morgan who's with Arktos Books; which is responsible for New Right material being introduced to English-speakers. I attended their annual conference last October in which Alex Kurtagic and Markus Willinger were speakers. Again, I really do advise looking into the Group as it's rather promising.</p>
<p>I'm glad you liked the article, which represented a bit of venting on my part. I think, broadly speaking, I succeeded in laying out a rough series of principles for future nationalist organisations.</p>
<p>I agree with your suggestions, which are cogent. I would very much like to see a New Right think-tank emerge in the country. After all, who would have guessed that it was to be Russia that would fall to Communism in the 20th century? Despite the moral timidity of our own group, and the omnipresent desire for middle-calss respectability, there's a lot of energy here. The glorious vision of Anglo-Saxondom has collapsed, and must tragically be abandoned. We must now win ourselves a place in European civilisation, from which we sprang, such a position can be most prominent.</p>
<p>Above all, we must create the infrastructure required for a vanguard, an iron core. Before we try to build a people-winning machine, we must cultivate ourselves. I shall let you know how the day goes tomorrow, as I'll very much be making a case for Nouvelle Droite. On another note, do you have a Skype account? If so, I'll add you when I return.</p>
