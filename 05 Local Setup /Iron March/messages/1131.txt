<p>Hi. Well partially I like some weird stuff myself. But really I can't say why. All I know is it's more important to sleep with who you want and how you want in private as long as it is safe, than to protest and disrespct the government in public. Or to take some hippy drugs that are essentially poison. As I said, I'm not new to Fascism in general, but I came here to get a better understanding of it and how I can hopefully applly it (or have an influencial friend who shares my beliefs apply it) to my country.</p>
