<p>Yeah, it's bad form to mention it now but White Australia was a direct result of unions being pissed at Chinese and Pacific Islanders being brought into the country as cheap labour. Check this shit out:</p>

<p>From Wiki, but it's accurate. Also kind of explains why van Tongeren viewed Australia as built on 'national' socialism. Except for a few die-hards in the deep-left of the Labor Party, socialism was never about reaching the "light on the hill" of command-economy Pure Communism. We have a phrase here- "a fair go"- which reflects this attitude. It's about the little guy not being fucked over, getting "a fair go" from business &amp; the state. We were one of the first countries to introduce 40-hour work weeks, the minimum wage, paid annual leave etc., and that mentality has stuck around and influenced our national psyche a lot, even if it has its problems. The "fair go" concept has been abused like shit, the unions used it for a long time to strong-arm industries and strike over ridiculous bullshit, and it's fostered a real entitled deadbeat attitude in a lot of people I've met too. As I think you said, you need balance.</p>

<p>I was going to write a whole bunch on my economic views but I'm way too wordy as it is, and at the end of the day from what I know from lurking I pretty much agree with you anyway. My view of socialism's now more centred on the ideal of putting the national community first, not 'economic redistribution' or whatever, and I'm well over idealising national syndicalism as I once did, but as an Aussie some of that "fair go" stuff is pretty in-built. Feel free to go into more depth on this if you like, economics isn't my strong suit tbh.</p>
