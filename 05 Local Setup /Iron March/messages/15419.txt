	Ha ha ha, you scared me there at first when you said that you went full jew in the game. At first I thought you meant that you went and fought for the Republic.....you didn't do that right? Anyways, today was my first day of uni and it looks like I am going to be very busy this year, so I probably won't get to read any books until I am once again between semesters or on break. Hell, it looks I am going to be so busy this semester that I may not get to start reading books that I want to until next summer! I guess I'll just have to see. Of course if that were to happen I could just stockpile some books now and read them latter or in the summer. Last semester/summer was when I read the most books (for fun and that I actually wanted to read) maybe 15 books total give or take a few, basically a crap load since I did actually lose count. But it was a lot.  On the bright side, being this busy will ensure that I only play swtor for 2 hours week or maybe a month. Not really into the whole mmo thing so I don't do guilds and that shit. Just the story and side quests, and whatever else helps the Empire ;) Also, yeah ha ha I wasn't asking for a summery of the book, just if it was good or not. Kind of like we did on <em><strong>On War</strong></em>. And thanks for the kameradschaft. Wish more people here understood that like us.
