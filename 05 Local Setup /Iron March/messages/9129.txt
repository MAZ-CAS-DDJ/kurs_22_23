<p>That's wonderful, I was actually planning on making a thread where I wanted to ask you to make a section called <em>Netherlands/Flanders</em> under <em>Fascism</em>, I was waiting until all the files had loaded on the Internet Archive.</p>

<p>I made a small collection of 29 files, 2 of these are in English. They are Fascist and Nationalsocialist works made during and after the war.</p>
