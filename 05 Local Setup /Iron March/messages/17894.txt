	Not only can you not read the intro materials or the forum guidelines but you can't read English, period. If you incur enough warning points you will be gassed and failing to respond to arguments is a reason for incurring a warning. This is from the guidelines

	<strong>1.4 - </strong>Constructive debate. The goal of debate is the pursuit of truth therefore you should take care about what you are saying and care about opposing arguments and should assume it is the same for your opponent – so where relevant you should be capable of providing sources to back up an opinion - this is an argument. Ignoring responses while continuing to argue shows you have no investment in the discussion and also, that you have nothing to offer or contribute.

	This is what you're failing to do. Comply
