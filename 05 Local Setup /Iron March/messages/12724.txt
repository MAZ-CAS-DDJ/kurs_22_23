<p>Yeah I guess I'm ironmarchs official pagan zealot, I'm fine with this honorable role. The runes at their surface level are sacred letters , we know this because there were certain rules to carving runes and the pagans never used them on paper or for practical means. But on a deeper level they represent the forces in nature and society and according to list, they were the forces the gods harnessed their power from</p>
<p>From a historical viewpoint their basic forms were copied from Latin scripts, but their style and mystic background came from older germanic symbols found on cave paintings going back to the early bronze age. Their mythical origin is given in the eddas</p>
<p> First thing you need to read is the havamal or sayings of the high one. Tldr odin hangs himself on the world tree, stares into heaven and the underworld, and draws up the runes over 9 days and marks them upon himself, them falls down screaming and dies and is reborn. </p>
<p>The second thing you need to read are the three rune poems. There's the Icelandic poem, the Anglo saxon, and the old norse one. All three are written in a different style and explain each of the runes in sort poetic stanzas, for example the Anglo saxon rune yr meaning bow goes "A bow is a blessing to any prince, a good adornment on a horses saddle". Some are more simple or complex or more or less christian or pagan depending on the age or particular rune</p>
<p>And finally there's a few contemporary writers worth reading. Guido von list is the best although he most relied on blood memory instead of archeology so he wasn't always the most scholarly, but was very philsiophical. Edred thorsson is a little better read on his shit but he used to be a satanist so I've always been a bit iffy about him. </p>
<p>If you're willing to spend time tracking down artifacts I would also recommend looking at rune stones or other artifacts with runic inscriptions, they reveal alot about the purpose of the runes and why they were used as sacred letters</p>
