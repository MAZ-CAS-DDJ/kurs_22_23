	Misanthrope is Bulgarian? Hmm, lol, it's a good thing you didn't join them though. People like you and I belong in a different type of group ;)   (I'll tell you about it in the message). But good luck to them of course. More fascism is always a good thing.

	Oh my God, it's so funny that you guys were just discussing these things, because I just reached the exact same conclusion as you, and the main topic of my message is actually going to be that exact same thing: a fascist world government. That's my ideal now. I was actually really shocked to see you've typed that phrase because the coincidence was so strange, I was thinking "What the hell, is Vas hacking my computer and reading it already?" But yeah, actually, Slavros is wrong. In fact, he has no idea what he's talking about. If you take fascism to its final (and I mean really literally most extreme most extreme final) limit, you'll arrive at that conclusion: a fascist world government and nothing else. There's no other conclusion. Anything else is just a different shade of leftism. (I'll describe it further in the message.)

	Lol, I knew you were going to bring DBZ into it, haha. I was almost debating with myself, "Dang it, why 9000, how about I lie and say 8000 instead, but eh whatever, fuck it, who cares, it is what it is, I'll just type the true number."

	Ah, really? Damn, I had no idea. But yeah, you know, I probably wouldn't have done it before with my previous beliefs, but I'm more motivated about doing it now that our struggle is the same thing. Yeah, I'll do it… one day. (You should reply by saying, "Yeah, just like that Yazdanism thread," lol.) But nah, all jokes aside, for real, things are different now. I'm more motivated to participate here on IM.

<p>
	Btw, from now on I'm FascistFascist. My aim is to be as much of a fascist compared to an average fascist that a fascist is compared to an average person.
