<p>I intend to inquire further onto your platform of national socialism; I will not do so in your introduction thread as it is an introduction thread &amp; nothing else.</p>
<p>As a man born in Germany &amp; an adherent of orthodox National Socialism(I am what your Strasser called a 'Hitlerite'), I carry a great amount of respect &amp; solidarity for your people. We fought together, although they were for different visions, goals &amp; reasons - we still fought together, and solidarity in battle is one of the most important bonds two cultures can share.</p>
<p>I'd like to inquire upon your opinion of orthodox national socialism, as opposed to left-Strasserism.</p>

<p>I don't have a platform yet <em>per se</em>, just "starting points", mostly in spirit, borrowed mainly from the Stennes-Strasser duo, and Japanese/Pan-Asian nationalism borrowed from Ishiwara minus the weird Nichiren stuff. </p>
<p>I'm sure orthodox NS is fine as it is, my main critique of Hitler is his compromise to the Capitalists and his lack of a coherent system-- saying different things to different people for his own political ends. I understand that was necessary to obtain and keep power, but that is my main objection to Hitler. If that is not the case, I would like to know more about it.</p>
