	Hey cool display photo there! 
</p>

<p>
	How are you? Which country do you hail from?
</p>

<p>
	I have an alternate way of doing things. I birthed my babies at home, and do not vaccinate. :) 
</p>

<p>
	Its wonderful so many seem to view home schooling as a good thing. I get so untrusting. The Gov here is cracking down on non vaccinating families and I am wary about what I do online as I fear if the Gov knew my beliefs they would take my children.

	I am amazed department of child theft has not yet showed up on my door! Its probably going to happen one day at the rate things are in Aust.
</p>

<p>
	Cheers

	Keirra!
