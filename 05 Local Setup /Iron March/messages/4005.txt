<p>There was one serb in Codreanu march several years before. I think it was very unusual to cry about romanians in eastern Serbia and have serb in your main event... Well when you dont have your own NS movement then is acceptable to admire someone else. As foreign NS org from that time Ustase hit the score. Dont take it personally.</p>
<p>Btw what is the current situation in Serbia? Did your politicians will annex North Kosovo or play Europeans instead ?</p>
