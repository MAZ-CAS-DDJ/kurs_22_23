	I see, thanks for the update, we'll help you out with the donation campaign once you begin it. Good to hear that you're still active, was concerned that you had gone dark. It's been an interesting few months for all of us really but so far everyone's coming out smelling like roses, I'm sure you'll overcome as well. Obviously the Mason video can keep until after this is over.
