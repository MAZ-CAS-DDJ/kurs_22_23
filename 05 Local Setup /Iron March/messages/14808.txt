	Its really not that hard to study tactics and learn how to hold a gun you don't need to sign up for the system. I really don't for see my self waging a guerrilla war against the system right now at this point there are no connected groups right now, you can find manuals online for all sorts of stuff guns , tactics etc. The system is the entire thing don't just think of it as the military and police its also the modern lifestyle the way of thinking bringing down the system when we talk about it would be apocalyptic in nature. It would be the ending of the Kali Yuga it will signify the return of a great hero kalki to defeat the spiritual evil of the dark age and usher in the next golden age. So in essence everything from this world will have to burn.
