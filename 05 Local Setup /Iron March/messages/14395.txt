	I compose and record my own cello metal music, a hybrid of folk, black metal, and classical. I'd link it to you, but it's under my real name, so I'd rather not do that, seeing as we just met. I actually haven't shared my music with anyone here on IM, even the ones I've known for a couple of years now. Perhaps sometime in the future, but not now. Nothing personal, just gotta be discreet.

	I also like to read books - from literature to history to sci-fi and fantasy - I love the works of Tolkein, for instance. I'm also a massive nerd who's way into stuff like World of Warcraft (used to play it on and off for about 6 years, then quit for good last fall, it was taking up too much time, but it was fun while it lasted) and Warhammer: 40,000. I still play the 40K game Dawn of War 2 from time to time, it's very fun.
