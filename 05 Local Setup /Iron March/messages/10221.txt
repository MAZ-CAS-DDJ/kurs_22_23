<p>Yes. The People of Color. Notice how they don't care about East Asians and Indians ie. people who are working and don't cause trouble. In fact they always ignore the lots of Indian and East Asian engineers when they moan about the lack of "diversity" in certain industries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah. That is silly. I am glad I don't live in the US. The idiots want to force all the crap on you like it was the cultural revolution in China. I think the left is already cannibalizing itself. All revolutionary ideologies are doomed for that. Because they are based on destroying establishments they are not building so that means the next incarnation will always be more extreme and degenerate and the old guard will be what we call liberal. Feminism turned into a joke with the "rape accusations and manspreading etc." of course not even in Sweden they are calling out the islamic rape hordes but they want to ban pissing while standing. I hope the muzzies will chop the feminists up, it will be a poetic justice. Eaten by your own minions. How sweet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>People never care. It is always a select few that actually start to put things in motions. People are just caring about their day to day problems and the world the media gives them. They can't even be upset a bit because it is forbidden. So they will care about the reality shows, sports and their meaningless little lives. I don't understand the need for social media in general for most people. They just exist, they are not that unique nor interesting...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah. I remember people talking about that shirt. Ugh. What I can say. Breads and Circuses. Who cares if Obama makes WW3. That's not interesting but the latest kardashian? or whatever news is so important along with the shitty repost of a repost about pointless lists about entertainment or "wisdom" by celebs. Don't get me wrong I am not a fanatic by any means but people refuse to care about things while only caring about the fun stuff. I mean real world is fun to look at because it is a big problem begging to be solved. Of course for the " normal people " caring about the big stuff is either pointless or it is done by being drones to the established parties.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also the shirt was blue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah. My generation is shit. I really don't feel any connection to it. It's turbo liberal, cynical, materialistic and even... girly. Being a faggot is trendy and I don't mean sexuality I mean the attitude the hipsterish, girly look and obsession over entertainment and drugs etc. So they are so individualistic they ended up being clones. Well done millenials, well done. Not to mention that they are so incredibly naive. They worship liberalism and every degenerate value it has. I'm not kidding you even in Hungary I can see those people online who are obsessing over gays and talk about evil cis white mans. I am not a pacifist and but I don't advocate for violence but man, it sure makes me feel bad about the country. All these fish blooded hippies who actively hate on Hungary and all the real values while they thing they are so original and smart. Conscription should come back. The army would a man or at least a boy out of these estrogen abusing faggots.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have to agree with everything. For me what it made it easy is a bit of a "fascist" thinking. Might makes right. It's not cruel it's how the world works. If we fail then we failed. Nobody will have sad tears about us. Same goes for the liberals. We are just forces moving around, gaining resources and trying to gain the upper hand on each other. The masses are just the cannon fodder that tries to exist in the framework of the currently strong system/idea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just don't be a defeatist that doesn't work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To answer to the last sentence. They simply don't know these things. For them multiculturalism is "the norm", beating diversity into the heads of people start with the children's cartoons etc. And well people are stupid of course they will ask for more welfare and breed more stupid kids they can't afford in the first place. People should have consequences for their actions. If there wasn't welfare the parasites wouldn't breed as fast as they would. Society should stop hurting the winners and aiding the losers. It will only end in tears. </p>
