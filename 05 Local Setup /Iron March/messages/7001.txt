<p>It's pretty realistic, certainly more so than Green Street (afterall who can take a hobbit seriously as a hooligan?) It also happens to be one of my favourite films and I agree with you on Frank Harper, I like him in Lock, stock and two smoking barrels too; Tamer Hassan is pretty likeable for a turk too, another good actor. Most of us here can relate to a lot of the stuff in the film and find that stuff the funniest and just take it for what it is, entertainment, I was one of the younger gen hooligans and was more fascinated with it than ever before after seeing the film when it first came out and my dad telling me some of his stories - most of them got sick of the younguns talking like they were cockney hardmen after seing the film though, that's probably the only negative cultural impact. My most connective part of the film is where they get put in the back of the police van with members of a rival firm and start having a shout out with them.</p>
<p>I'd still say the closest you could get to realism in the scene over here that was acted out was the film The Firm, starring Gary Oldman, it was only an hour or so long BBC production, kind of like Scum was, only this is shorter than Scum.</p>
