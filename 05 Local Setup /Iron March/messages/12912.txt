	yeah, its embarrassing really. I know so many whites that will latch onto "oh im cherokee and black" or "i have asian DNA" while they have blond hair and blue eyes, most of them look like theyre from the same part of the rhine as I am. theyll tell you all about some indian tribe and yet know nothing of their own heritage, exept "nahzees" and beer.

	 i always thought fighting a crocodile would be pretty close to a dragon lol. mine are either extremely surreal or really plain. I had one dream i worked in a record store for some reason, but with the same people I worked with at my last job. I had one really horrible dream where I kept going into more dreams inside the dreams by falling asleep. Was very weird.

	 it doesnt sound stupid honestly. I love rural lifestyle, it feels more aryan to me. its funny, alot of furries are fanatic about the environment (the ones in my drawing class keep crying about the rainforest) yet they dye their hair with chemicals and wear plasticy jewelry. to them its just a way to look moral

	14 88 boots on the ground right? not super long, like a 3 or 4 inches? maybe longer, i need to cut it soon. yeah ive heard german education on WWII is a joke. the rebellion thing among youth is finally turning against the system now that they realize  whats really oppressing them instead of their parents or the man

	yeah i wasnt thinking of posting it publicly, just sharing with you. I could just use an imgur link or something. no, i have skype though. I dont use a whole lost of social media. and i understand, thats why I havent shown anyone my picture even though ive been here at least a year. im a little curious honestly but youre right, you probably shouldnt share a picture here. i dont know why some of these madmen do lol

	 i didnt know most of that. i heard rumors of the gay thing but i didnt know it was confirmed. shame the way he treated his wife, especially her nature. its fine to rant, ive basically been doing the same thing haha.

	thats the main reason, i get pretty frustrated when talking about the things happening right now. youre a  sweet girl so i guess it feels improper of me. thanks, youre very nice too! you might not look like unity (according to you), but youre definitely the model of aryan womanhood in spirit
