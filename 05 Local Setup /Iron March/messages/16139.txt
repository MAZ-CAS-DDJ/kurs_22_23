	Hey, man. My life has been good these past few months, thanks for asking.

	With respect to the new leap stuff I honestly didn't read every post by Slavros/Zeiger but my problems are with the alchemical fascist alma mater material. The most glaring issue I've seen which I was really critical of was the absolutely massive non sequitur between setting up their philosophical framework (there is only one Truth-with-a-capital-T, aka God aka cosmic order, and everything good is a manifestation of this singular Truth whilst everything bad is one of an infinite number of lies or deviations from this Truth) to asserting an equivalence to Fascism as upholding this Truth, while other ideologies are lies. There is no consistent method to decide what counts as a manifestation of Truth, and what counts as one of these deviations from Truth. So in practice whatever people like (Fascism because this is a Fascist forum) is labelled a manifestation of Truth and whatever people dislike is labelled an unnatural deviation of cosmic order - a lie. The incident I think you're referring to is me getting frustrated when someone thought it was a good argument to say Christianity = Truth and appeal to this IM new leap framework. If it weren't for all these new leap materials I'm sure that argument would never have been made. Saying 'but X=Truth' is really no more meaningful than saying 'I like X' but now thanks to a year of this nonsense some people seem to think there's a ton more weight in the former.

	Moreover this is all pointless intellectual posturing which is the very thing that's hypocritically denounced (though they use different terms for the same thing - e.g. they do 'research' not 'philosophizing').
</p>

<p>
	I also see Fascism, as most people do, as simply a broad term for various related political movements in interwar Europe, not as some grand primal Truth. I think trying to redefine it in IM's own special terms to people who come to a Fascist forum to try to learn about the ideology is dishonest and counter-productive.

	I could go on but it's really irrelevant what I think as I'm no longer involved in politics.

	Hopefully that answers your question.
