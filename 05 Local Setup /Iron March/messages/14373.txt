	I am a member of Falanga organization. I would send you a link to our website, but currently we are having some technical issues with it. Yes, our ultras often start fights and recently they have formed an unofficial alliance with Russian, Serbian and Slovakian hools in England. Current political situation in Poland is slightly better, but it's still far from perfect. Our government introduced some social reforms + they are more conservative/patriotic, but on the other hand they are pro-kike and pro-NATO. Also, fag parades, etc can still take place without any ban.

	I also have some questions for you:
</p>

<p>
	1. What's the current situation in your country?
</p>

<p>
	2. What's your stance on the aforementioned issue of discrimination against Polish minority?
