	Actually, the more I end up thinking about it I guess I really am both. So I'll just change my ideology to "Fascist Reactionary". Ha ha maybe it would be a little easier to get into academia as a "Reactionary". Which technically is not compromising my beliefs. :)  I have also been thinking lately that if I can't teach social philosophy maybe I could specialize in aesthetic philosophy and write political and philosophical Fascist and or Reactionary books and papers as well. What do you think? Let me know if you get this. Also, sorry for the mind changing messages. Won't happen again. Let me know if you get this.
