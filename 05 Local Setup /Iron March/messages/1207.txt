<p>Capitalism is already a selfish idea. Sweetcheeks 1 and 2 are both self-defeating names. Not to mention i can't stand Sweetcheeks 1 and 2's racism.</p>
<p>I don't want to debate with the sweetcheeks because they are too idiotic, and too racist.</p>
<p>P.S. what do you think about Saddam Hussein?</p>
<p>BTW, when i read Kim Il Sung's biography, he said that he did not like the "Left" and "Right" political deviations. I'd show it to you, but i don't have it.</p>
