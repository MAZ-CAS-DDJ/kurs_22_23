	Yeah, at least two a week is better than none at all. I'll be able to go to the gym more often once the semester ends like always. As for deadlifts I unfortunately don't do those. I use the two days a week to do upper body (bench press, overhead, and lats) and lower body workouts. As for proper form I have a coach that helps me out. Like I told you before though I had to start all the way at the beginning so my stats aren't really impressive but I work hard and I am consistent so at least I have that going for me. What I really need to start doing though is crunches in order to get ride of that gut I told you about! Which to be fair has actually gotten pretty solid underneath, it just doesn't look that way unfortunately. Which is again why I really just need to start doing crunches.
