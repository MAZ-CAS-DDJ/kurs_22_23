<p>Well i have mixed feelings about them... They are cool but the isolation made them wild and vicious even toward their own (i mean north Koreans) i think that the right way to secure bright future for Korea is to unite the both countries but in way that will not destroy their identity and so... I dont like mainly the current events in DPRK like the power to transfer in bloodline cuz sooner or later some stupid fuck will ruin everything because he will recieve all just for liking party buts and will be totally away from the people and the ideology he will only in theory understant what it take to build a movement to maintain people hope to show them the right way to  gather their trust ... you know things that made you bond with your people....</p>
