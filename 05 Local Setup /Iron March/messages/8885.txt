<p>She works at tech support for videogames now in different languages, which is apparently her dream job, but people give her more money on her stream than her job makes.</p>

<p>Yes... I considered that a long time ago? I did everything I could, I demanded she be mine in the most romantic ways possible for months. Like I said, she's an idiot. She picked a fat, ugly beta-faggot nerd over me. Literally counter-evolution in action. I can't stress this enough, this isn't just me being bitter. Seriously, you wouldn't believe it. I was being serious when I said I'm 99% sure she has autism. The real reason had to do with her parents and her friends who all hated me and were demanding she leave me for years. I know that sounds like a kind of weak reason, but she's the kind of person who you could say "I love you! Marry me! We'll run away and start a family away from these people! I will be yours always! etcetc" and she will just cry and run away and block you from everything online so that she doesn't have to hear you anymore and be forced to make hard choices... even if that was what she wanted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Do I need to remind you again that she was the one who wanted me? She was obsessed, she used to randomly burst into tears about not being good enough for me and how worried she was that I'd cheat on her... The whole thing is confusing as fuck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>tldr; she's basically just a weak person. It was my fault for being in love in the first place. I fell for it because I like taking care of sad little girls but it didn't work out well for me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's just hard for me to move on because I'm too romantic and sentimental.</p>
