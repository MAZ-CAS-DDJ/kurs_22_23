	You should try to influence those people. See, in South Eastern Europe we have almost no such idiots. Yea, we had a gay parade yesterday that was heavily guarded but that's it. I can't possibly imagine living in such society. Women dressingÂ like men ? Extremely rare. And with the sensitive metrosexual men trends ? Disgusting.In the recent years we had some isolated cases of degeneracy but people overall are strictly against. Sometimes I can't believe in what twisted times we are living but der kampf geht weiter :))
