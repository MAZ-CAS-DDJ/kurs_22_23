	This site has been up for like 4 years?<br />
	Intelligence agencies are already over this place conspiring its the first thing you find in Google when searching for 'Fascist Forum'.<br />
	Also I can understand why you're so uncomfortable.<br />
	In my viewpoint there are some countries and peoples who cannot salvage anything.<br />
	Like my own Filipino people and Americans really have nothing but destruction at this point.<br />
	Some point ago I realized I was being an edgy nihilist, but then I realized this is actually what Spengler described. What you're feeling is probably what Romans felt when the Empire collapsed or the Byzantines when the Ottomans conquered Constantinople. <br />
	Before joining this forum I realized that Slavros is probably just an edgy guy who's the sort of intellectual he hates and that Ben was the real hard shit, but the fact his forum and his ideas about Fascism are probably the most comprehensive of any source in the internet is what made me decide to join in the first place. <br />
	I think the best experience for any Fascist is a near death experience or some revelation like that.<br />
	Like what happened to Junger during the WWI.<br />
	The thing that really cemented by separation from normies and probably permanently entrenched me in this forum is when I visited Dallas and Chicago. Looking at how disgusting everything was left me with a impression I can't forget. Even if Ironmarch is a honeypot that some people joke it is I can't really go back anymore.
