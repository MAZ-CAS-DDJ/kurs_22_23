<p>Well, sadly most of the details are lost due to my great-grandpa fleeing from the commies, and my grandpa fighting them in WW2 and then fleeing too, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostislav_Stratimirovic" rel="external nofollow">this guy</a> is my ancestor and he was really goddamn awesome.</p>

<p>Since I plan to move to Bulgaria when I'm finished with university here, I definitely want to learn Bulgarian. I'm planning to start teaching myself with a language coursebook this summer. When I finished my studies, I'll buy either an apartment or a house in Sofia, depending on my finances - currently, I'd theoretically be able to buy a small apartment already, but I'll save up some more and hopefully be able to afford a house.</p>

<p>The languages I'm fluent in are German and English, I speak some Italian (but it's rusty since I haven't used it in years), and I know Latin, Middle High German, Akkadian, and some Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse.</p>

<p>I have a good friend in Bulgaria who lives near Sofia, and will train my Bulgarian with him once I start learning it. He already taught me about "zdrasti" as a greeting <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_tongue.png" alt=":P" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>
