<p>The man I met, about forty five years of age, left in 1995 after he attained his PhD in mathematics. He still has family in a more rural part of SA, but he made is clear, though he may visit friends and family, he will never return permanently. In under twenty years SA has turned from a modern nations state replete with infrastructure and the like into a dystopic third world wasteland roamed by AIDs infested blacks, mixed race filth, and governed by corrupt tribal chieftains like Zuma. I get livid at how people believe that it was the Bantu speaking blacks, not the Afrikaners, who founded SA. The amount of ignorance and propaganda fed to Americans about the history of SA is unbelievable.</p>
