<p>Well, you got your point across to the ones willing to listen. At least a few people took you seriously and agreed, and a few more half-way agreed. Wasn't a total failure, some good came from it. It helps people realize they're not alone in thinking "you know... maybe it's not <em>all</em> about race", otherwise they may have just fallen back into their gentile mindsets purposfully to either avoid being called a faggot or because they think that's what they <em>should</em> believe in, so they force themselves to think that way. The ones who are willing to listen have listened, and the ones who aren't can keep on keepin' on with whatever they've got going for them. At least you know who the Aryans are now.</p>
