	I respect that. Some editing could prove useful. I've kept things quite vague already, but some antifa with a good sense of 20 questions can narrow things down quickly, so I did edit a couple posts. I made my age less specific and reworded my line of work. It's still true but hides myself better. I made my response of my location as being "Western Canada, far from the ocean" from before I had mentioned I live in a city. With that last change my original response was quoted by someone and is still visible there. I realized my comment narrowed down my location to 2 or 3 cities. My identity is attached to those places elsewhere. I'm afraid I'm on a short list.

	I want to be as open as I can be, but I worry that revealing anything about my occupation puts me at serious risk.
