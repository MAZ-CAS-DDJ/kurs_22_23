<p>Hello,</p>
<p>If I remember correctly you created a thread a couple of weeks ago about Wikipedia.  I was just wondering if you have any experience writing articles on there.  I'm looking to create an entry for the American Blackshirts, so if you have any advice you can give me it would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
