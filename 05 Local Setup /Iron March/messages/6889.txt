<p>Greetings! The NS-Arischen Volksgemeinschaft is not a "public" National Socialist party. We have a Southwestern Command region,  based in Texas as well as a Eastern Command region based in Rhode Island. We are working on setting up training compounds as both commanders are ex-military men. We advocation revolutionary National Socialism and as such, security is tight with non-members. If you are sincerly interested after the little I've told you, feel free to contact me at nsavcouncil@yahoo.com. sieg heil!</p>
