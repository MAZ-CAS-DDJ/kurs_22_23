<p>I have to disagree. As I said before, if we do nothing, we can not know how well something will work. We need a solid plan for getting the "base number" of followers for such an action to work; I'm under no illusion that this plan will role hundreds upon hundreds of men in immediately. However, I do believe it will, even in such a small and gloss-overable form, attract one or two people who will be able to provide a bigger "net".</p>
<p>It's also not mutually exclusive to any other action. We can pass out pamphlets, create a manifesto, help our community, etc. However, it's one more tool in our arsenal, and, as hard as it will be to begin with, it will attract people.</p>
<p>That aside, do either of you mind if I invite Elegos or Jacob? We still have two spots available in this conversation.</p>
