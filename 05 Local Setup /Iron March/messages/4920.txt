<p>Mang, if Golden Dawn ever get into a proper conflict with the government and their shills; it's going to to be released breath of europe - no doubt all nationalists will help take up the cause, I'll definitely go. In our own nations it's almost pointless at the moment, there's no letting up from the gov't, so being able to actually do something will be excellent; like the 90s balkan wars all over again. Except that it'll have a clear goal and since with development of the internet, everyone will know about it and how to get there. Might be even a few of those dudes dressed in fukken waffen ss uniforms like in croatia, lol.</p>
