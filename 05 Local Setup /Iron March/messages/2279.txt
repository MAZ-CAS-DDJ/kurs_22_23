<p>Yes, Islam is a beautiful religion. Even the infidels admit that Muhammad (pbuh) was a man of high moral character. The west has been shaming his legacy tho.</p>
<p>Why did you adopt a Third Position ideology? I got into it after reading stuff by Sayyid Qutb. His views on Jahiliyyah (ignorance of the divine) were great. Modern society seems more preoccupied with filling her own pleasures than caring for your neighbors and pleasing the merciful God.</p>

<p>Well, I was a Marxist-Leninist, but some of that theory urked me (all the "equallity and "nationalism iz teh ebils" shit). I also started getting into some black nationalist stuff and read alot of National Socialist, Fascist, and National Syndicalist liturature.</p>
