The problem is Jews produce a Sigmund Freud, Rabbi Manis Friedman, Bernie Madolff and a Ben Bernanke and an Ilya Ehrenburg for every... I can't even think of 1 Ashkenazi Jew I like off the top of my head. When I think Jew I think of foul Ashkenazi creatures. Non-Ashkenazi Jews are religiously and culturally mislead people ethnically similar to higher-caste Arabs. However they are loyal to international (Ashkenazi)Jewry, they are lackeys for the Ashkenazis.</p>
