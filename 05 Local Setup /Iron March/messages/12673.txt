<p>yep, its in the Apocrypha. they were books of the bible there were edited out, either by the catholics or protestants. theres another part where jesus tames dragons too to save a shepard. first gospel of the infancy of christ I think. yeah just wait til you study germanic myth, if you arent familiar with it already. still though, despite how crazy myths are there are deeper truths to them. thats pretty weird, i would think anyone voting for hillary would be pretty far left. and yeah we have one good ski resort only open in the winter, but its pretty pricey and crowded. what other sports you like?</p>

<p>yeah hes a hardcore fedora too so monogomy or tradition isnt his thing i guess. jesus, even america doesnt do anything that bad on a regular basis. ive seen pictures of "educational tours" where the white kids play the slaves to black kids on command of the teachers but i dont think thats very widespread, or at least i hope not. I would beat any teacher that made my kid wear shackles.</p>

<p>I actually just got my DNA test results in but ive heard theyre unreliable sometimes, results were 66 percent continental germanic (mostly western and northern germany but also dutch and belgium), 19 percent irish, 6 percent nordic, 5 percent english and traces of other stuff less than 1 percent (including caucasian apparently). my dad always claimed we were native americans too, apparently that was a lie kek</p>
<p>i look the part at least, i look pretty german</p>
