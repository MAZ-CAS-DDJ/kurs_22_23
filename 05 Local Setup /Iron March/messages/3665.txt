<p>Well that brings up a serious problem, in terms of who interprets that particular passage. Which is why I am so critical of the reformation, the reformation allows anyone to interpret ancient writings according to their whims. Which is why there is such a multitude of denominations who are often obsessed with a literal reading of the King James Version. I trust in the Tradition of the Orthodox Church to provide guidance in understanding these ancient writings.</p>
<p>  Loving your enemies pertains to your personal enemies within your in group. It pertains to other within the Church. It take no effort to understand how militarized Byzantium was, it takes no effort to learn how Byzantium held back the onslaught of the Ottomans. There are plenty of examples where people of the Faith fought bravely for their people, It is a historical fact that the Cossacks slaughtered Jews who sought to enslave and poison their Orthodox brethren.</p>
