<p>As for tshirts, basically the way I did it was to start a fundraiser on something like indiegogo.com and use it as a pre-order, then when it's finished you get sent the money and can produce the shirts from a local printer. I've got a printers about 30mins drive from me who do good quality at a good price. Then I just put a bit of profit cut on top so we can buy more books.</p>
