<p>Yeah, i saw your thread where you threatened to leave last time. And a new thread may not be a bad idea, if nothing else, it'll be interesting to see how people react to someone other than Vlad saying it ,because evidently he's made quite a few enemies who will take each and every opportunity to bash him, and everyone else likes to jump in for whatever reason. If you'll notice, everyone was agreeing with him for the most part at first, at least partially if not completely. It wasn't until Slavros turned it into an argument that it became what it turned into, if i remember correctly.</p>

<p>Anyways, i still don't see how that thread could have embarrased the forum. Anyone posting there who also posts on Ironmarch would already know about the Aryanism thread, would already know that Vlad has been supporting this idea lately, etc. etc. so it really couldn't embarrase the forum. And since the thread didn't mention Ironmarch (at least, not that i saw), someone who didn't know what was going on and just decided to read, wouldn't know it was associated with Ironmarch, therefore there's no way the forum could be embarrased that way either. Maybe i just didn't read it thoroughly enough? But i just don't see it.</p>

<p>And either way, you make a good point about it being slightly ridiculous that they take image boards seriously.</p>
