<p>I can understand the first two points, but I don't really see the third point so well. It's not a defect to be disturbed by something and then be against it. It might just be that owning dogs myself had a bearing on the impact of that gif but I still don't think it's unreasonable to be against that gif just being posted there; a warning would have made it better.</p>
