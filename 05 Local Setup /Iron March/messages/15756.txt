	I get you a bit more now. Ryan isÂ a nice guy with a messed up life. As far as I knew he had nothing to do with MD but I haven't been in proper contact with him since about February. I don't think he is in jail. He never came across as suspicious to me, just highly intelligent and at the same time dangerously careless and naive.
