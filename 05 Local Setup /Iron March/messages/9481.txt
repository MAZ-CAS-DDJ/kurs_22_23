<p>About the Neofolk thread since it was dead I thought I shouldn't post anymore. Plus, recently I got a hardcore hype therefore I'm not listening that much of neofolk as I used to do, but certainly I still a great fan of the genre.</p>

<p>So, about the reliable sites I don't know about Von Thronstahl but Death in June is pretty in American underground, so you can even find in ebay - same for Current 93 and Boyd Rice. I'll give you the links of some distros that I trust, ok?</p>
