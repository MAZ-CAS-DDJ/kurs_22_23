<p>You're absolutely right about Eastern Europe and it's as I've said before, very few people are disillusioned with the commie crap because they actually lived through it (or <strong>close enough</strong> to it if we take the classic commie excuse that it wasn't real communism), some faggots here still think it's "good on paper" and "noble" for standing up to nazis. In the UK many people actually have a candid sympathy with NS Germany and always point out the parts where Hitler kissed our ass and wanted peace with us, some even acknowledge it was a pointless war which could have been avoided; it's a shame many of them go "who?" when you mention Oswald Mosley. Now BUF had a good fascist culture.</p>

I have considered Eastern Europe many times as the cost of living is good over there and purchasing power is reasonable if you have a lot of money to throw around already, but of course you already know that. Excessive materialism has done a good job of preventing spiritual awakenings. EE seems to have enough to live a happy life.</p>

I'm going to admit, I don't mind rap. The rumour is it originated as a limerick game amongst the celts. Also without electronic pioneers like Kraftwerk these nigs wouldn't have many of their beats today. Even Method Man said the best who ever did rap was a white boy (Eminem). We used to rap a lot back when I was in school against each other, unfortunately it was wiggerish in hindsight looking back on it, hey that's being a kid for you though, but there's no reason why it should have been had we known to direct it better.</p>

Agreed on the tracksuits too. I used to wear full TN tracksuits when they were being made, comfy as hell in all weathers, looked snazzy and lasted me for fucking years.</p>
