<p>Indeed! So long as America can maintain her loyal non White subjects I'm fine with others Racism. In fact it may even be necessary in parts of Europe to save the Nation as a whole. I'm also opposed to the sweeping number of Illegal Mexicans for the same reason. Asians are fine though, as a re secular people from the Middle East, Persia and Turkey. I'm not a racist in any capacity, but I do believe the cultures of Europe and Asia are superior to much of the world.</p>
