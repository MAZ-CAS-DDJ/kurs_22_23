<p>I am active once again, so I shall respond to this.</p>
<p>I am always gratified to see that there are other Jewish Fascists out there, as I think the Fascism will soon prove to be the ideology of the future, and indeed the only way we can save ourselves from the fate of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p> Of course, I'm preaching to the choir here, so I shall say that I have returned, I shall continue to post, and thank you for the message.</p>
<p>I just have one question: why do you say you were once a Jew? Have your beliefs lapsed, or are you just disillusioned with our faith? I'm quite Orthodox myself, so I have a hard time understanding why people leave Judaism.</p>
<p>I mean no disrespect, of course. I'm simply curious.</p>
<p>Solidarity to you as well.</p>
