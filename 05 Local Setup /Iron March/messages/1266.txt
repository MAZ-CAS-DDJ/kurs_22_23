<p>No, not lately. I have been on newsaxon a lot lately, fishing for people interested in true national socialism, not white nationalism. </p>
<p>I am definitely a racialist to some extent, though I think most white nationalists are batshit crazy. I read the other day on new Saxon about how all Asians are inferior, without even a mention from a single person that aryans are an Asian ethnicity.</p>
<p>According to most WNs, my blonde daughters aren't really white, because I have Indian In me, and their maternal great grandmother was Half Mexican, despite the fact that her husband was a former SS soldier. Clearly he didn't seem to mind. The point they miss is that while the SS was ethnically pure (in the very beginning) the pure bloodline bullshit was never a major factor in nazi policy. It was more, a German is a person who believes they are German and identifies as German both racially and culturally.</p>
<p>But either way, I could give a shit. I follow th BUF pretty religiously in their doctrine, not the nazis.</p>
