<p>Good to hear about the your activity and that you are putting in an effort to make a difference. Now, in terms of the Europe being first bit. Europe is the ancestral homeland, it is our kingdom where our blood was ultimately forged and where our history stretching back thousands of years ultimately lay. It is also where we have the best chances of making a difference because when we talk about heritage/culture/blood in France for example, they will understand since they actually got a history/heritage that go back thousands of years. If I talk about ethnicity to them then they will understand because that goes back thousands of years for them as well. They have this unique history to fall back on and understand. Canada, the United States, do not have this, they are an extension of Europe, a colony and should not be viewed as anything more than that. The colonies of north america do not have an ethnicity or race behind the state that they have propped up, they were founded by Europeans yes, but they have morphed into a multicultural cesspool and the majority of people have fallen for it. The colony project, and that is really all it is, has failed and it is time to go home with a vengeance and take back what is ours, and should the day come when we can re-establish these colonies then so be it. Move the front lines back to Europe.</p>

<p>The concept of our organization is that we are a racially orientated organization, not an ethnically or nationally orientated organization. That means, so long as you meet the racial criteria, then you are welcome, no matter your geographical location. This allows a much larger pool of people to recruit from. Additionally, our goal as an organization is foster the growth of other promising groups, especially a political party in England for example, and with our support then that organization will grow. So because we are not a locally based organization that is in any competition with any other groups, that means a person can be a part of the Consortium while still being a part of their own local organization. So, now we even have a larger pool to draw from because we are not in competition with anyone since there is nothing really like us.</p>

<p>The beauty of this concept is, we can do anything we want, anywhere at anytime so long as the local laws permit it. If we want to build a few PLEs then we can do that, if we want to train a small private "SS" then we can do that, if we want to build a towering Headquarters atop mount Olympus to put the Reich Chancellery to shame, then we can do that. We are not limited in our abilities, only by our imagination and the things we can accomplish are grand if we have the people who share the same idea. Remember, just because our primary intention is Europe, does not mean we will not want a presence in the colonies in the form of offices, divisions and a few PLEs, after all there is a lot of people to recruit here and a lot of people to help. It just means our political efforts are focused on Europe. I am fully able to bring myself and a few others into your Skype conversations, although I suggest you consider looking into Teamspeak3 since it is quite superior to Skype all around and is more flexible.</p>
