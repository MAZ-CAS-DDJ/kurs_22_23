	Seeing as you are a French speaker and a writer i was wondering if you had free time, if you could Translate Robert Brasilachs interwar novel  "<em>Les Sept Couleurs</em>" I have tried to read what i can as i learn the language but i certainly wouldn't trust myself with a translation.

	It seems to be a very unique novel from a Fascist Perspective Written before the war about the wider Fascist revolutionary movements and internal strive as as well a a personal drama it was even nominate for the Prix Goncourt so i imagine it is a Good novel in it's own right even to people who aren't politically minded but from what i've searched their doesn't seem to be an English Translation of it.
