	I see, well I tend to find that hazing stuff pretty retarded in general but if that's the way things are done here I can live with it. Are you referring to the reading or the people PMing me? The only literature I've read in full so far is the one called "Next Leap", which like I said wasn't necessarily brand new info for me but I did appreciate it as a good synthesis of modern fascism. The others are "Siege" (which seems pretty damn interesting tbh) and "American Futurism Workshop", both of which I haven't gone through due to exams like I mentioned earlier. If you were talking about PMs then no, these aren't them.
