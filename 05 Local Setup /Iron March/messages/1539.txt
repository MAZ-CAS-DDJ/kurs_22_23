<p>Hey, just wanted to say that I've enjoyed reading your posts. It is nice to see someone with such and indepth understanding of philosophy. Most people here do not have that. I consider myself limited but with a solid grip as to the various philosophical trends of fascism. Regardless just wanted to say keep up the good posting, the forum has gone downhill as of late (tons of Nazis and out and out racists) so it is nice to see someone with a much intellectually based approach on the forum.</p>
