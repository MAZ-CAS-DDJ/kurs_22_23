	My mom and her parents left Poland in 1983 during Martial Law implicated by the Communists. ZOMO (Paramilitary Police Force) and the LWP (Polish Peoples Army) started cracking down in the cities. People were getting arrested, kidnapped, and murdered for anti-communist activities or speaking out against Jaruzelski. Everything was done by bribes in Poland. My grandparents bribed Soldiers to let them cross into Germany so they could get to Sweden. The situation in Hungary I heard was similar. I had a Hungarian neighbor almost all my life. He escaped into Austria in the 60's - same situation with Military crackdowns. His family died of sickness and imprisonment, so he left everything behind and was almost killed by Police. When he got into Austria, he was imprisoned for 8 months. When he was released, he made his way to New York City, and worked extremely hard. He is dying of brain cancer now, and just rots in his bed. This man taught me hard work from when I was a child. I helped him for many years so its very sad knowing that he's going to be gone soon, but his memory will never fade. He will be in the Heaven he deserves soon enough.

	Back to the story of my parents, my mom lived in Sweden for about 8 years, and went to study abroad for University. She met my dad and had me. They wanted me to have dual-citizenship so they went to Sweden and had me there. My grandparents still live there, and I visit them every year. Its a very small town, but I've noticed that everywhere you go in Sweden, it is being filled up with 3rd World garbage. I hate Islam. I have met those "Immigrants" when I was younger, and they are absolute filth. They terrorize Swedish communities. Muslims stole my grandparents car, and have attempted to break into their house several times. Its a nightmare.
