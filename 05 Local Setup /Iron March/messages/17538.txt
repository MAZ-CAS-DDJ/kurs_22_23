	Hey there. I haven't traveled anywhere since that thread unfortunately. To be honest I shouldn't have posted it since I was angry at the time and just wanted out of the situation I was in. Having said that the dream I have of living as self-sufficiently as possible is still very much alive and things are moving in that direction, although I can't be more specific at the moment.
