	Lel my family expects me to earn shekels outside of the Philippines. They think I'm being retarded in being a farmer. <br />
	My family will probably live here, my parents most likely will retire to the Philippines. <br />
	I'm planning to go to the Philippines for the summer, without any electronics and shit. <br />
	Third-World style, will probably not post in Ironmarch during that period. <br />
	Also why do you like Star Wars so much?<br />
	I mean its narrative style is basically a ripoff of Japanese cinema and story telling.
