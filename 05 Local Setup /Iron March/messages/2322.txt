<p>Benjamin Noyles,</p>
<p>I am not here to role play. The fact that people took my idea of Commissars as being strictly from a table top game means that they missed the point of it entirely. </p>
<p>I am legitimately trying to receive criticism on my idea. This idea is not for some petty little game, it is what my dream society is. If I was not in the right forum then where is?</p>
<p>Is there something that I did to honestly role play? Because none of that was anything close to role playing. The final posts I made were in regards to your star post, and then in rebuttal to the autism posts. So I am confused as to what I actually did wrong.</p>
