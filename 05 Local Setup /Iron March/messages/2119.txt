<p>I do have a question.</p>
<p>I am curious, but who told you I was progressive? Or is it because my ideology I list as progressive National Socialism?</p>
<p>I am not opposed to most hardline positions, so I believe we could get along. But I believe in pragmatism. The mainstream will always reject Fascist ideology unless they can be appealed to. If you want to control the media, it takes Realpolitik.</p>
<p>I have a few hardline views, but I prefer to not always include them in my general position. To mainstream requires a public appeal. And since Science and Math are unbiased, it is how the Fascist can prove some of their convictions.</p>
<p>I would like to read your hardline positions though. I am always interested to see where others stand. Perhaps, if we disagree on some things, we can later have good discussions on the forums on those things.</p>
<p>I also would have a beer with you. I like Stella Artois and Stiegl.</p>
<p>Also, how did you come to Iron March? What brought you to these political theories?</p>
<p>For me, I had confliction when I was younger. So many Jews were liberal, but I had Jewish family who served in the SS for the Third Reich and in the Hitler Jugend also. This is what first made me question who I was and right and wrong independent of media and propaganda.</p>
<p>Especially when I found that there were more still Jews in the Nazi party that my family knew also. German Jewry and Naziism I found was a hidden fact-- hidden by the the association of Jews with Zionism instead.</p>
<p>This started me in taking a new nationalistic outlook. The pride in Germany and German Jews who served Germany. I found that the truth was in contrast to the messages put out by the liberal establishment. And that I should not feel guilt for being German, and that I should not feel guilt for my familial past. No family is clean of guilt, so why obsess in it.</p>
<p>And even though I had my Bar Mitzvah, I felt I was still drawn to another purpose. My last name is Norse, and my father's clan is named after a Norse god. And so, I had an obligation to German Jewry in addition to a Norse tradition that became German Christian. With Nazis in the Jewish and Christian sides of my family both.</p>
<p>From this basis, I further developed my beliefs in National Socialist thought and intellectualism.</p>
<p>And I ran across this site on the Internet.</p>
<p>So now you know as much or more about me than most on this site do.</p>
<p>What is your story?</p>
