	When you have a name like "ThatOneNationalSocialist" and you make <strong>THREE</strong> threads asking where to find a fascist group, then assume that people will think you're either trying to expose or infiltrate groups.

<p>
	We take this sort of shit seriously, especially with the recent terrorist infiltrator attack on Atomwaffen Division when Devon Arthurs, an Atomwaffen member, converted to Islam and planned to blow up an Atomwaffen Division meeting. He killed two of his roommates who were also Atomwaffen members. His third roommate, who is a member on this forum (Odin - Brandon Russel), was arrested and is now in police custody.

	Devon is now telling lies about Odin. Of course the police doesn't believe the lies, but they are pushing them on the media so that the public will believe it and denounce Odin as a terrorist neo-nazi.

	Be more careful with your posts in the future.
