<p>"You know someone's butthurt when they lie to others about putting a virus on your computer"</p>
<p>Firstly, if I was to put a RAT on your computer, do you think I'd use one that is detectable by virus scans? There's a reason why I paid for my botnets. Secondly, I never claimed I did, you buddy Aristocrat turned on everyone in the skype call(Vlad, Ben, and I) because he has a crush on Erika, and she said that we were going to get Alex arrested somehow for the prank calls. You hate people who love Asian regimes, yes? Then why are you so buddy buddy with Aristocrat? </p>
<p>Why would I even care about you? You're a 24-year-old who is incredibly easy to make angry(the whole point of why I post to piss you off) who talks about movements, but has done nothing to start a movement in real life. If you're idea of a "movement" is people on the Internet, so be it. While Vlad, Ben, and I are all being "Evil foreign nazis", we'll also enjoy having our own local parties with people we've met face to face in them. You fail to understand jokes, or get when someone is shitposting just to piss you off and not be serious. 'Tism is a hard thing to deal with, innit?</p>
