	Lol reservists pick up rank fast he says. No, I JUST got lcpl. I've been in for 2 years and just fucking got it. I've got active cats I graduated boot camp and ITB with that are already Cpl. And contrary to popular belief, our unit kicked ass at 29 stumps. The coyotes said we out performed lots of active companies they've seen in the past. If I go pmc after enlistment I might go down to Mobile, there's a guy there that only hires Marine grunts. He hires out for naval guarding so shit like Captain Phillips doesn't happen again.Â
