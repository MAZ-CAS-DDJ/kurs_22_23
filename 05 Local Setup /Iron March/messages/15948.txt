	Those are good news!

	What do you know about the girl (Melisa Ruiz?) leading Hogar Social? Is there someone behind her? It is hard to imagine that she is capable of controlling a group like Hogar Social all by herself. You are right though, a guy like Gianluca Iannone of CasaPound Italia would give a better impression, but you need the sexy girls for the good marketing also. :D Golden Dawn is also a good example, they have nice girls but their leaders are strong men.

	I'm glad you enjoyed the movie. What about the book and the game?
