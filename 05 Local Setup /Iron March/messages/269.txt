<p>Cordial Greetings Slavros,</p>
<p>I was wondering whether you could clarify matters concerning Ethno Nationalist. In the "What it's like to teach black students" thread, it is my belief that he overstepped the boundaries for the last time; especially keeping in mind his previous insults directed towards my comrade. But then...? I'm not entirely sure what happened. Logs seem to indicate that Mierce upped the Warning Level to 10, which must auto-delete; I don't know. Noyles then lowered it back down two points. So I suppose that my question is: Should I raise the level back up to 9? And what will be the result of his actions? Adminship wrath, perhaps?</p>
<p>Bonum annum novum,</p>
<p>Dux</p>
