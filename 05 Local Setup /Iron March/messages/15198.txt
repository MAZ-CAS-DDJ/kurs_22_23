	I don't really care about labels. What matters is what you are, not what you label yourself. If I remember correctly Slavros had a good post about fascism being both reactionary and revolutionary. Shouldn't care if you take flak so long as you follow the truth. I have no problem with reactionaries but we are more than just that. I'd say we're more revolutionary than anything, especially in the new world.
