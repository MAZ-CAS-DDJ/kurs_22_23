<p>Being known, I understand what you are saying about that, in a smaller way... around halfway through high-school I stopped censoring any of my thoughts in debates, and word spreads pretty fast. When you speak your mind, people respect you, even though some of them are terrified. One of the common things I heard was "I hesitate to side with fascism, but I agree with everything you say and I think it's awesome you are not scared to say it." One of the things I noticed is that others are scared to be the first one to say something 'politically incorrect', but when they hear me say it they agree strongly and have many good reasons for it.<br /><br />Yes, about being the most talented student, I remember you saying it! That is something I respect you for, you are driven in not just the 'fascist' part of your life, but you work hard in all of it. I remember you saying "Fascism is about living an ardent life," and I think you are a great example of that.

People hear that I am a traditional Catholic and that I believe in some patriarchal values, and they think of someone sitting quietly in the corner and obeying everyone. But that, of course, is not the way I live and that is not what it means. And they think of a fascist as a mean stupid guy who just beats up anyone. And then they meet me (and you!), and their ideas change. There's a saying that "Your life preaches a better sermon than your lips," and I try to remember that always.<br /><br />I think there are advantages to being a woman and a fascist/traditionalist/nationalist. People were willing to listen to what I had to say and not really feel threatened by it. (Many people develop a fear anyway, but it is the fear that comes with respect) They are comfortable asking questions, and saying they agree or disagree, and asking me if this-or-that is really true or not. So I have always used that to my advantage, especially when talking with young girls. They are more likely to listen to me explaining how a woman should behave than they are to listen to their grandfather. That's one of the things I love working with the Church, is helping girls understand its teachings on women and the family. When they just read the Bible and the Catechism alone, they can get confused and think it is too harsh. But when they have someone to talk about it with, they can see the beauty and honor in how God tells us we can live.<br /><br />I like the song, it's a sad one and it's very pretty. When my father could speak, (he can't anymore), he would always speak Croatian with Serbs  when we met them, and I thought that was so cool! Luckily they are the same language!<br /> </p>
