	Not really no , because they're all based on the same degenerate culture of modern America, they think primarily only on race based initiative and not culture or spirituality or hierarchy. There will undoubtedly be residual feelings for the egalitarianism of America were they to successfully seperate from the main U.S or the federal government were to break down. American culture is Â essentially anti-traditional from its base in the Revolutionary war, the minute the colonists rejected rule by divine kingship and culture it began to slide towards liberalism and degeneracy.

	I think that Americans like me that have an overwhleming amount of European ancestry that is not mystery meat, should return to Europe , perhaps European powers could recolonize America in the future but that is LARP territory , however modern Americans base things like liberty and democracy over obedience and tradition. I am a fascist not a white supremacist. Race is only valuable in that it is a part of the cosmic order , but without intellect , spirit and tradition race is meaningless.
