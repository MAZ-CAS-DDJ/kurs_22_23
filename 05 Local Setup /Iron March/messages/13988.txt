	I don't have a product by any means but was interested in a consulting plus management role of the internet aspect of lead generation for your business. Anything that gets you more phone calls or gets you targeted leads filling out forms. Which if done creatively and efficiently, can bring you a long term business as well as a future staff. I would create the strategies for you and find best places to optimize, eventually being able to offload it to one of yourself or one of your staff.

	This could be a huge blitzkrieg done in a couple months if you want to spend the money, and have a quick little internet empire for yourself. Depends on your budget. But for your town I could establish a great amount of leads and get them inside a funnel where you know who they are and continually send them useful information, so they are not lost as in with other types of advertising. This would return a lot of long term and steady profit. Which I could do for $2500 one time fee, 3 months work and paid over that time.

	Or if you have a smaller budget we could just focus on classifieds and copywriting stuff that's easy to distribute locally. But to be honest I'm just motivated to do a huge campaign and really skyrocket your career because I study the marketing wizardry and would love to share!
