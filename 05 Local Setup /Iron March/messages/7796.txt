<p>It is doing well, but not as well as Jobbik is doing, I'd say.</p>
<p>Our party is on the opposition, yet the hands of our youth organisation reaches deep, we're laying low once again, as the riots have somewhat diminished in magnitutde.</p>

<p>Speaking for our activities in the campus, we are focusing on the upcoming conference that we're going to hold on wednesday, we're going to bring a speaker in honor of the 10th of November, the date of death of Atatürk.</p>

<p>The party is...somewhat passive, I must say. Its all that people talk about these days, that the party is too passive.</p>
<p>However I can understand the caution of the ruling cadre of the party. They have past experiences of the 80ies, and times before, where communism was still a threat. In spite of our valiant defense against the red menace within our universities and streets, we have received punishment instead. So the party is not keen on sacrificing the nationalist youth so easily for something that the state police and army should handle.</p>
