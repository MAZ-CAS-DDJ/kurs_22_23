<p>It's pretty self evident, yeah. No matter where they are, nigs will be nigs. Italians aren't even very racist for the most part yet we all hate the thousands of shitskins showing up on the beach every day. Was chatting with a liberal cousin over there and she was complaining about them.</p>

<p>Roman paganism is about the most autistic larping fantasy on the planet, literally no fascist would touch that shit. It's almost as bad as wicca. We had a "Roman pagan national socialist" on here a while back, he shit on Casapound and I chased his sorry <em>asino</em> off rather quickly.</p>

<p>I know a lot of jews, lots at my old school, but I never liked most them very much. I didn't figure that out until recently.
