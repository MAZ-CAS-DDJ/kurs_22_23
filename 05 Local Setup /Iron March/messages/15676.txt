	Well, maybe you would have. I think my flat feet and upturned nose (I'm Celtic remember) probably still would have kept me out. Ha ha well at least it is not a curved down giant bird beak kike nose. Lol I am going to have to find a good Arayn woman in order to breed these deficiencies away! Ha ha. Well at least an implicit critic is still a critic. I'll give it some more thought.
