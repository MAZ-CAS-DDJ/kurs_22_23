	Not a fan. They were fighting to basically bring back the secular Yugoslav state that existed in interwar period. Bunch of them were drunkards, not a real warriors. They sided with commies in the beginning but when they saw what they were really about they broke alliance. Still they didnt colab with govt and "Serbian SS" in order to fuck up commies for good.<br />
	Because muh Anglo friends. They only joined them in 1944 during the retreat but it was too late.<br />
	They are glorified by "nationalists" here but generally were useless during ww2.<br />
	Real chetniks were those of Vojvoda Djujic, Kosta Pecanac and some others. They fought commies and Ustashe and saved 1000s of civilians.
