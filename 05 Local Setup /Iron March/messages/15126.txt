	Good to meet you.  My name is . .James lol.  That's not very doxxing.  Gotta love generic Anglo names. Yeah, I can absolutely understand someones tendency to attach a spiritual reverence to Hitler.  I probably do, but more than the man its the worldview that he so as you said sincerely and passionately channeled through him. .like an avatar of something bigger. National Socialism as we understand it is the truth of life applied to human affairs.

	WLP communicates it well also.  There is a spiritual element to national socialism.  There always has been.
