<p> </p>
<p>I am doing well. Summer is a bit too hot for my taste but that will go away sooner or later. I don't mind that too much.</p>
<p>I am lurking on the forums a bit. Not much big happening is going on now but the Azov and National action topics are ones I am reading to start to finish now due to interest in people actually doing stuff.</p>

<p>I'm reading about older art and design styles now. I think it would be good even to go back to the 30s. I dislike the current university student masturbation they call "architecture". </p>
