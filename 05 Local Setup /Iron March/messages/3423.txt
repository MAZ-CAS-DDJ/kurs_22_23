<p>Hello, the RPG bug has bitten me again. Me and a friend are thinking about getting a skype group together to play either 4.0 DnD or a star wars RPG my friend has. It has to be on our time though, American Eastern. </p>
<p>Also, We're trying to put together are own RPG game to eventually publish. I'm trying to create my own SIMPLE mechanical system for it using a d100 and then other die are only used for damage. It won't be like the Orthodox d100 system where you roll low, you'll have to roll high (so as not to confuse noobs) but I need a way to create a new Resistance table with it. Would you like to collaborate on the mechanics for this game? I need a bit of a hand.</p>
