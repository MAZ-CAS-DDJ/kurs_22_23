<p>Hello, Ironmarch user Raven.<br /><br />I couldn't help but notice that I received a notification saying that you liked my post in Thulean Perspective videos thread, <a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/5864-thulean-perspective/?p=147401" rel="">this one</a> in particular. However it would appear as if you have accidentally disliked the post. I must request that you rectify this error as quickly as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I must confess that at first I thought you were offended that I had not yet liked your post in the thread "PsychOps/PsyOps" and therefore refused to like my post until I had liked yours but I assure you there is a perfectly valid reason for this. You see I had liked the most recent post in the thread by Xav but then found myself embarrassingly out of likes. It will please you to hear that the situation has been set right, and you'll find that the appropriate post has since received it's belated 'like'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rintrah</p>
