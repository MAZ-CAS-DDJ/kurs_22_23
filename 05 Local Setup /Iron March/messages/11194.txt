<p>&gt;in downtown London</p>
<p>&gt;crowded bazaar, sand people are haggling for prices with the local Africans</p>
<p>&gt;I'm trying to buy a Persian rug using the broken Urdu I've picked up whilst staying in Bongistan</p>
<p>&gt;All of a sudden a sandnigger throws off his jacket to reveal what appears to be a suicide vest</p>
<p>&gt;"Allahu Ackbar!" he yells reaching for it</p>
<p>&gt;Don't know what to do so try the only thing I can think of</p>
<p>&gt;look him directly in the eye</p>
<p>&gt;"Cool clock, Ahmed"</p>
<p>&gt;"Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great."</p>
<p>&gt;He lowers his hand from the detonating device and seems moved by the empathy I've shown</p>
<p>&gt;"It's easy for me because I've built more stuff that's very complicated"</p>
<p>&gt;"Like?" I ask</p>
<p>&gt;He replies: "Like CPUs. Soldering them."</p>
<p>&gt;"S-sure you do," I say</p>
<p>&gt;He walks away into the sunset</p>
<p>&gt;one week later blows himself up on Obama's motor convoy when the American president visits England</p>
