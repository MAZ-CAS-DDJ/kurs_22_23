<p>I'll post on the forum sooner or later, it's just that I'll have to reilliterate everything so that the others follow my reasoning; a tedious affair.</p>

<p>By 'commercial' I mean to suggest that the movement has developed something of an artificial series of mechanisms, through which it wishes to tap into 'youth' culture. This is illustrated by what are, in my opinion, somewhat cheesy statements concerning heroics and noble virtues which translate into teens covering public places with stickers. The 'Identitarian' label and philosophy are things I subscribe to, but do we intend to be a youth movement or simply a <em>movement</em>? As I mentioned earlier, there is a need to Anglicise any and all foreign imports if you wish for them to gain a following here. This is why we'd have to make the spirit of this manifestation our own.</p>

<p>We're certainly on the same page as far as broader principles are concerned, very much so.</p>

<p>Pan-Europeanism is important, for us it's imperative that we assist our people in overcoming their hatred of the Continent (Derived through the European Union) and that we readjust the nation's civilisational orientation; from the Anglosphere to Europe itself. But one must achieve a synthesis, the Union is spiritually dead and with it 'British' identity is dying too; this is confirmed by the 2011 Census results. English identity, which the establishment recognises as being very, very volatile, is just waiting to be fostered and cultivated. It's ludicrous that so few Anglo-Saxons know of Offa of Angeln, Hengest and Horsa. I do strongly advise you to familiarise yourself with our folk history! </p>

<p>As for de Benoist, that's another discussion entirely, his own works should be consulted. But I'm mainly referring to ideas that concern strategy, revolutionary activity and cultural struggle. </p>
