	I hope it lasts as long as possible, the blowback will be even greater. They could cut off all the refugees now and send them back, but that would mean that the system would stay the exact same as it is now and thus the same shit will just happen again. Of course they aren't going to send them back, which is a good thing. In fact I hope as many shits are imported as possible. Because the more that people indulge themselves in their delusional bullshit and wishful thinking, the harder it is going to hurt when everything collapses and reality makes its return. This is how the people will learn. Anything that hastens the collapse of this world is good. Our enemies are doing just that, they are digging their own graves without knowing it. All that can be done on our end is improve ourselves in anyway we can, so that when that days comes, we are the very best that we can be.
