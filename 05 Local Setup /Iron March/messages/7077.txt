<p>Ok no problem, it's good for exercise. I actually got a difficult exam coming up where we have to translate historic Latin texts, so everything helps. I study history and I had to take some advanced Latin program (the only other choice was advanced German). It's a stupid system, they don't allow us to take say basic Italian or Spanish which is what I would rather have, just because of some random bureaucratic rule, so I'm stuck with perfecting my Latin which I'll never really need since my field of study is modern history. I had Latin in my high school too, so that's 10 years of learning Latin. Well, everything's good for something.</p>

<p>As for medieval Latin, it's differs quite a lot from Classical Latin, you also have so-called late Latin in between these two (3rd-6th century) which is the basis for ecclesiastical Latin which the Church uses to this day. In the Renaissance they tried to go back to origins and back to antiquity so they rooted out the medieval Latin styles, trying to use classical Latin style more. And then you have Neo-Latin which I already mentioned.</p>

<p>Medieval Latin was influenced by Vulgar Latin ie. early forms of modern Romance languages, but even in middle ages you had some scholars who were familiar enough with classical Latin works of antiquity and avoided medieval forms (like Thomas Aquinas). It's funny that scholars from non-Romance countries were usually better in Latin because they didn't mix it with their own language. So it's quite a mess, some texts are incredibly difficult to translate, even my professor couldn't translate some shit. And of course, Latin is a rich language, you can express the same thing in million different ways, there are tons of archaic forms. That's why I never agreed that it's a dead language, it has developed so much after the fall of Rome...</p>
