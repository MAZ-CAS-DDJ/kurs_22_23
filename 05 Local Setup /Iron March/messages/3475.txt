Ultimately, I want to see a return to traditional, strong conservative values and common sense economic and business practices. So I guess I'm not as extreme as all the jackbooted uniform wearers who play Internet warrior but I am way outside the political mainstream and most people here can at least appreciate my view.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>LiberTARDianism is horecrap, no doubt about. I was one for a long while so I know all of its problems. I think if Mises lived a little longer he would have seen its shortcomings and become a Fascist Capitalist _he already admired Fascism for saving Western civilization from Bolshevism and anarchoid Syndialistism he just thought Corporatism was ineffience and he was right about that, but he overlooked the possibility of a Fascist Capitalism.</p>
<p>The Jackbooters are dumb asses, no one should want to be like them. You're on the right track and I'm sure plenty of the sane folks on here appreicate your insights.</p>
