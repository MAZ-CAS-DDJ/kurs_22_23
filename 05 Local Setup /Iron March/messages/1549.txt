<p>Paradoxically I think this forum generates less drama than other forums I've seen. Heated debate and the occasional tantrum yes, but it is a political forum after all.</p>
<p>However yes, lack of time is the main reason of me resigning, some (nice) recent changes in my life have a consequence on the time I'm willing to spend online, and it's way less than before. We now have many users and I'm not able to read each and every thread anymore - let alone monitor and moderate things.</p>
<p>Also we'll have local elections in october, and for the first time the movement I belong to (Nation) is sending candidates into the boxing ring. I intend to help, so whatever free time I want to spend doing politics will be spend IRL.</p>
<p>Cheers, WiB</p>
