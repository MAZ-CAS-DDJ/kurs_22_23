<p>I understand, Mehmet. Don't worry too much about it, in the end it's a life lesson. I do hope you'll manage to fix it so we can continue to have our discussions.</p>

<p>By the way, a topic I've been thinking about nowadays: which is better - the French(centralized) or the German(federalized) State model? Most ancient Kingdoms and Empires were prosperous not in spite, but because of a high regional autonomy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Seems to me that way too many people nowadays link federalism with secessionism, but isn't federalism the normal State of the people? Upwards - from family, to town, to county, to region, to country? It seems that centralization causes cultural mediocrity since it forces the different regional identities to compromise to an all-consuming state. Can we talk about civilization without freedom?</p>
