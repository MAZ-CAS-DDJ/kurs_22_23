<p>Thank you very much for your detailed response. The Philipine Phalanx looks particularly interesting. What's up with these Kombat Pilipinas-guys though? Are they serious? They look a bit clownish to be honest.</p>
<p>Your plans for your country look promising and well thought out. I do think it's a good idea to work with an existing nationalist movement. You can't do much as a lone wolf and founding yet another dwarf party does little good, it only further fragments the political landscape and nationalists everyhwere need above all one thing - unity. Also, you may have the chance to introduce your own ideas into the organization/party after some time.</p>
<p>I myself am determined to become more active this year. At the moment, I'm in contact with members of various nationalist organizations in Ukraine to see which ones are the best folks to work with.</p>

<p>True they're trying to be NS, but yeah, i kinda agree, they're too clownish, they're even trying to imitate the WNfags in this pic. (Aryanism.net kicks ass, do not doubt) "Kombat Pilipinas"? I do think that while that "Kombat Pilipinas" is trying to be good, the messages are confusing, it calls itself 3P, but they're claiming themselves right wing. But the FB page does have a good message, although their "Stormfrontism" makes me cringe a bit, mainly because they might be imitating WN fags (which is white version of Zionism), not real nationalism. I think they're on the cross of trying to be true and being NS fetishists. So yes, i'd consider working with the Philippine Falange. Another flaw with Kombat Pilipinas is they're christianity-centered.</p>

<p>True my country is Roman Catholic and i love the message, but i'd do wish they consider Muslims aka Moro and other non-catholic Filipinos as racial brothers as well.  So either remove the cross, or add a crescent. I'm not saying remove the cross and put crescent instead. I'll try talk to them on their opinions on religion, although they're only trying to be "we are a catholic nation!"</p>
<p>From them:</p>

<p>But as in the forum pinoyexchange, username "Artemio Ricarte" (username reference to a Filipino General who made an alliance with Japan, as he saw the yanks as destroying his country), the NS Germans weren't bad to us.</p>

<p>Anyways, our level of power is not as good as Golden Dawn (no positions in congress or senate unfortunately), but this is a better start, than forming a party on its own. The Elite, the poor and the middle class is shit. I'm not joking either, as the only government we had nearest to Fascism is that of Ferdinand Marcos, who is unfortunately trashed for his "restrikshun to our freedumbz!", although his only flaw was being pro-yanky.</p>

<p>If you ever talk to a Filipino about President Marcos and he says "but he bad, cory good!" trash him, do not trust his words. trust the pro-marcos people, i swear.</p>
