	It wasn't only Soviet Union, before that It was Russian Empire. We did not join Soviet Union, we have been given Ultimatum and were occupied, nor did we help to establish it ,before occupation we had a Fascist government and everything was going well, the ones that helped establish Soviet Union were Russian speaking ''lithuanians'' - NOT LITHUANIANS. During Russian Empire occupation our language was banned (And that is the worst you can do to a nation). Then during Soviet Occupation ethnic Lithuanians (including my grandfather) were deported and Russians were moved into Lithuania. Ukrainians suffered holodomor, but Russians did not, it is yet another example how Soviet Union was pro-Russian and tried to eliminate smaller nationalities.
