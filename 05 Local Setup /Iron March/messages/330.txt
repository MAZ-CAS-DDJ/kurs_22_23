<p>Ah so that's what it is with you then, got a feather up your ass and fancy yourself a peacock, demand some sort of respect for yourself?</p>
<p>Now listen here Barton, I don't want your silly excuses and acting like I owe you anything. You registered on this forum and caused a little ruckus - I was fine with that while maintaining a specific personal attitude towards your persona. I was fine with you remaining a member of this forum as well but instead you disappear then post a topic about coming back. You ask me for input and ideas and a position and I treated you with as much civility as I treat any other member of the forum and give you constructive criticism. Then you disappear again and for good. I don't see you at all as a contributing member to our society but I didn't do anything about it seeing how you at least were not a lurker and figuring that you might remain an on and off again poster. But then it turned out that you went ahead and did something - you used the forum name without consulting anyone in the Adminship, acting like a self-appointed representative of this forum while in reality your profile is nearly dead from inactivity. Even active veteran members don't get away with doing what you did, but you are far less than that so I am not inclined to using much civility with you until you correct this matter.</p>
<p>And acting like a moody bitch will do nothing but make you look like one and get you the treatment that a moody bitch deserves. Get that feather out of your ass and delete that channel.</p>
