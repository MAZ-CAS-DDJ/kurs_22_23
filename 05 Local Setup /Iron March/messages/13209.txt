	This YT channel is also very good. In this direction you should go in near future. Threads and subjects that affect ordinary people, not converted fascist. For example attacking modern pop stars like Adele and Taylor Swift and everyone who will search YT will find your videos, because they are popular among people. 
</p>

<p>
	Of course that these kind of subjects will give you massive publicity and views.
