<p>Well, I am rather interested in history. I've heard Kursat mentioned on other forums by Turks. He is known to the Chinese as one of the nobles of the Ashina clan who rebelled against the Emperor Taizong. Taizong adopted Turkic steppe warfare tactics, recruited Turks into his army and appointed them as generals (a fact lamented in the Orkhon inscriptions), expanded into Central Asia, and took the title 'Khagan', and even held Kurultais. Taizong's son Li Chengqian (who was eventually exiled for attempting to overthrow his father) liked living like a Turk:</p>

<p>"He [Chengqian] loved to emulate Turkish speech and their manner of dress. He chose from among his retinue those who had Turkish features and grouped them in bands of five; he made them plait their hair, wear sheepskins, and herd sheep. He had made five wolf's head banners and tents and set up yurts. The crown prince took up residence here; he gathered sheep and cooked them, and then, drawing out his waist-knife, he would carve the meat and let everyone eat."</p>

<p>The flirtation between the Tang Chinese and the Turks seems to have ended after the Talas River battle with the Abbasids, and the ensuing rebellion lead by the Turkic general An Lushan.</p>

<p>Perhaps you know about the 3rd of May, which we Turkish nationalists celebrate as "Türkçülük günü", or "Turkism day", which was all about a response from the Turkish youth to an unfair accusation and trials that related to him and his friends.</p>
<p>Aside from being uncompromising, he knew the meaning of sacrifice, and he spoke of it as the highest of virtues.</p>

<p>I know of it, I read about Atsız in a document titled <em>Racism in Turkey: The Case of Huseyin Nihal Atsiz</em>, which is obviously not the most neutral source, but there are few available in english about this remarkable nationalist. Apparently Atsız wrote a letter denouncing Communists, and was then subjected to a politically motivated trial after accusations from Sabahattin Ali.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It seems that influential members of the Turkish government during that time did not like the Turanist idea (which they denounced as adventurism). I think this may be due to Enver Pasha's failures (for all these failures, at least he died like a man) souring them to the idea of forming links with Central Asian Turks, and then there was also Soviet pressure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've also heard about how Atsız was tried in 1973 for denouncing certain MPs as 'Kurdists' (if he could see the state of Turkish politics today, surely he'd turn in his grave).</p>

<p>As for Armenians, I think that they are if anything, untrustworthy. As for being well-received in Europe, even Kurds are well-received in Europe, but not us. Not that I really care, but the fact that the supposedly "liberal" Europe chooses its friends via Indo-European based bias is beyond me.</p>
<p>I don't think it carries a religious undertone, I think its just the typical liberal approach to any minorities that claim to have been persecuted, as long as they are not Turks, of course <img src="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/GeneralIMemoticons_smile.png" alt=":)" srcset="<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p>Armenians are despised America wherever they may be found in abundance and all races dislike them. Their most recent notable achievement here was the biggest healthcare fraud in US history, to the tune of $163 million. The Office of Inspector General's list of most wanted criminals reads like the guest list of an Armenian wedding. Surely there are good people among them, but they seem to have a culture of corruption which they have carried with them from Armenia. Every April, they moan about their 'genocide' and how they were innocent victims. While Armenians complain about how other ethnic groups are supposedly racist for not liking them, yet they consider all Non-Armenians as inferior 'Odars'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for the Kurds, it is true that many Americans (and especially Neocons) have an idealized image of them as progressive, freedom loving tribesman. I don't know much about them, but I doubt that they're as saintly as Western liberals make them out to be.</p>

<p>I know emperor Taizong, who is in my opinion one of the greatest Emperor China ever saw, as he knew full well that defeating and ruling the Turks were two different things. Defeating them would need a sound knowledge of their tactics, ruling them would need a sound knowledge of their customs and what they look in a sovereign. For that reason he adopted the title of Heavenly Khagan, and began employing Turks in his service.</p>
<p>He did in fact do us a favor by doing so, populating the less Turkicised areas of Central Asia with Turks, have allowed us to spread out influence, up until the creation of the Uyghur Khanate.</p>
<p>The Oghuz, my maternal ancestors, were probably the ones that have sided with him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Later on, the Turks primarily began to move westwards, and the ones that stayed were absorbed into the Mongols, tribes like the Kerait, Naiman and others were most probably of Turkic stock, and constituted a part of the original Mongol horde, long before my Kypchak ancestors were included amongst their ranks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for Atsız, he wrote an open letter, or more precisely, two letters to the President of the State at that time, not only denouncing communists, but also their employment and spread in public insitutions, and he showed Sabahattin Ali amongst the responsible, to which he responded with a suit of law, accusing him of defamation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And at the 3rd of May, when the second hearing was about to take place, thousands of nationalist youths swarmed the courthouse, and marched through the city to show their support for Atsız and his friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for Turanism, it is not that the Turkish government dismissed the idea completely, as the idea was still going strong during WWII, however, the growing leftist wing in the republic renounced the idea as it was spreading "hateful propaganda against our Russian allies". The single-party rule also supported them in this, as Ismet Inönü was known to be a man of low popularity, so he had to have some supporters, and he chose the left and the minorities as his primary base for support. Atatürk himself did not denounce the idea, but unlike Enver Pasha(whom I also adore), he was a calculating man, and he thought that the best way to serve the Turkish race was to first save what was at hand, Anatolia. The Turks would then have a shining beacon of light to look up to for freedom and sovereignity.</p>
<p>However, the deeds of the single party period under Ismet Inönü, and his shameful surrender of Turks who had fought on the side of Germany to the Soviet Union, and the many other Turks he returned to the Soviets(that fled for Turkey) only to have them shot the minute they crossed the border, alienated us from our brethren in Central Asia, Caucasus and the Pontic Steppes.</p>
<p>Only recently, 200 Turks have been allowed to cross to Turkey from Thailand, and that was because there was an enourmous pressure from the Turkish public to let them in, else, the government would have left them to rot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The current state in Turkey is also not too well. The fact that we're being held ransom by a bunch of Kurds in the mountains, is truly an insult to our heritage, and the Turkish national identity is being tried every day, whether it will ultimately fail or still hold strong. Atatürk and Atsız, have all forseen these. We're digging our own graves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for the Armenians, true, there are surely good people amongst them, however, what I dislike about them is that they prefer to do things the...dishonorable way. They dream of getting back Mt. Ararat and our Eastern Provinces, yet the best they can do is to hope for stronger nations to intervene, and enforce their claims. The Greeks on the other hand, have tried, honorably, to take our coastal areas, and have declared a state of total war just for this reason. Greeks have fought, bravely with a purpose, they failed, but no dishonor was upon them. The Armenians on the other hand still claim that they have rights on our lands based on a treaty we tore up with our bayonets, and just as the Jews, scream Genocide to legitmize it.</p>
<p>If they are serious, I suggest that they prepare for war as they did in Karabagh.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Kurds though...The Kurds are a strange people, a nation of mercenaries, who previously under the Ottoman Empire, were exempt from all forms of tax and all forms of military service, except when we would go against Iran, and then, they would switch sides if their side appeared to be losing, and during the war for independence, they were known for their rebellions, which had to be subdued by the use of funds and manpower that were needed in the western regions.</p>
<p>Well, now they seem to lay claim on our south-eastern provinces for the sole fact of living there. But their means of living, electricity and water, for exaple, are provided to them by the state, and most of the time, free of charge as they steal it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They do not really add anything to the country, but they take and take and take...There is no one in the middle east that likes them. I had an Assyrian friend from Syria, who frequently complained about their behavior. They too claim to be subject of racism, but are perhaps the most racist people I have ever encountered.</p>
<p>They simply do not understand this fact that we Turks do not have to give them a hand while they try to screw us in the back. They simply cannot comprehend why we refuse their demands, they lack the common sense as a nation that other nations too, might work for their best interests, mainly because only their interests matter, everyone else can go to hell.</p>
