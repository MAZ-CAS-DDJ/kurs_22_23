	yeah funny story at ASU online one of my classes there was this half Bosnian half turkroacch chick that totally wanted my D she was very intent on messaging me she emailed me and back then i had a small facebook account Â she added me and kept talking to me but I stopped because she was a devout Muslim and it was haram as shit . She wore hijab and everything and lived in Ankara. I didn't feel comfortable with it especially because that was back when IS was getting started and it looked like they were going to world dominate in like 2014.
