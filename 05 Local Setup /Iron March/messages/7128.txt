<p>By the by, since you are already producing some tshirts I wanted to ask what's the best way of going about it since you probably looked into your options before you started selling them. I wanted for a while now to launch some of my Fascist Style designs as tshirts but haven't gotten further than trying to figure out Zazzle as a simple startup option.</p>
