	I get it. I just still don't know EXACTLY where I stand on things yet. I've never known about the movement before the current degenerate years, but i've always felt left out. Different. Like this shit isn't suppose to be this way, you know? Like we've evaded our true fate. (like a guy that becomes a doctor but should have been engineer.. but like as a people, you know?)<br /><br />
	Parts of the truth were taught to me by my father, without even knowing he was natsoc, or that being it "was a thing". Some were taught to me by a russian organisation part of my life I wont go into. And i've always swam in that for years, analysing, learning about society, but without truly believing the world could be so fucked up, even with the past history of the world.. anyways..Â

	Dunno why im rambling on about this, just saying that I'm reajusting my lens and seeing where it goes.
