	Bartosz had found on kikebook (by complete accident btw) a Russian guy who had a profile photo featuring him and Roki. He wrote to him, asking where he found a contact to Rodoljub. He gave us a contact to his wife who speaks English. We phoned to her explaining that we are Polish fans who would like to meet Roki and she said it's not a problem. Later we phoned her and she directed us to his son who also speaks English. He was a translator during the meeting, because Roki doesn't speak English.
