<p>Yeah no problem I'll be sure to do that haha. I haven't made one before, are there rules to it? The lady said I should recite the rosary prayers with each bead while I make it</p>
<p>If I get more into this stuff I can make you one too sometime if you don't mind a heathen made rosary kek</p>
<p>That's good! Hopefully you nab the job </p>
