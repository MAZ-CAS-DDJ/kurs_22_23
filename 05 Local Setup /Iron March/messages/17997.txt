	Hi there,<br />
	Sorry for any animosity starting off. I don't have any left towards AW or you in particular. I do want to apologize for the conduct you saw in AV, but in my defense it was with the explicit purpose of breaking that shitty group into pieces and separating the worthwhile people from the cucks and the weak ones. Which in the end I achieved to some degree. Anyway, about the doxxing claims from Odin, he has apologized for the misunderstanding. There was no doxx attempt from AU or Youthknives, and I recommend talking about it with Odin to clear up any confusion. <br /><br />
	About the rest of it, which I can assure you I am not lying about...although I consider it water under the bridge. I haven't even bothered defending my "honor" in the past months since any of that happened because it's not worth it to me to involve myself in the drama. Honestly, I regret bringing it up in that thread. But now that I have, I'm willing to show you what ever you want to know. At the moment, I am involved in a very traumatic family experience, but i will do my best to keep up any correspondence you're interested in. <br /><br />
	Sorry again for any hard feelings. That is not my intention and I'd like to keep things adult.
