	Hey Vas, how's it going?
</p>

<p>
	So, I'm about 95% done with the message. Will send it soon in a few days. I wanted to give you a heads-up though: it has accumulated to the point of reaching almost 9000 words, so I'm thinking of cutting some chunks out to make it easier on you. Would you prefer that, or the full version?

	By the way, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/sDNtuPC.png" rel="external nofollow">this is you actually?</a> Nice, I totally missed that post! (Didn't know you had already posted a pic there. I guess the mountain thing was something else.) But yeah anyway, that's really cool. For some reason, I was thinking you might be much older than me, but it turns out we're probably not that far apart. I'm 22 myself. What about you?
