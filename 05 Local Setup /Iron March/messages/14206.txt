	Yeah, I was leaning more towards the first the anyways. Thanks, I buy it next month. Also, yeah I try to be as vocal about my beliefs as I can, people that know me well know that I am a Fascist. It is just a waste of though to convice my parents so I don't. However, I still continue to fight and believe.
