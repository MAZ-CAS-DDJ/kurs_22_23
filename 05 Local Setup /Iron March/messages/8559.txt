<p>Unfortunately Noidberg is somewhat busy so he doesnt have time to do it. I would appreciate if you could translate some articles, i understand if you have some issues with SRM but is it really worth of abandoning good and active movements because of few issues? Believe me i got couple of disagreements with NRM but compromises needs to be made if we want to accomplish something here . Also i talked with leader of FRM and he said that Klas said that, what Emil meant with his pro-Russian statement was that, we should not ally with america even if Russia is a threat because Russia and Murica are both shitty equally.</p>
