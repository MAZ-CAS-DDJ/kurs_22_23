<p>Yeah, I googled it; it's basically a cheap knock off of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting" rel="external nofollow">intermitten fasting(IF)</a>, which I've already done on and off since last year(technically, alternate-day fasting). He really comes off pseudo-scientific, discussing nervous system and what not, but if that pulls people in...</p>
<p>There's many types of IF, I'd suggest doing a 19/5(fast for 19 hours, have a 5 hr window to eat). Some people do 20/4, others do 18/6, but 19/5's have just enough time for two meals or so. The warrior diet, on the other hand, seems to allow snacking throughout the day but only allows one meal, which you'd have to get all your calories, carbs, fat, protein, and nutrients from. If you split that into two, you'll have a four-five hour window where you don't stretch your stomache out as much.</p>
<p>Sorry about your luck, though; atleast once you get through basic, you won't have to worry about food. Or money.</p>
