<p>Regional Structuring of Spain</p>
<p>The primary importance of Spain is not Madrid, but the provinces. Our most radical intention will consist of understanding and articulating the vital capacities of the provinces. Discovering their myths and launching them towards their conquest. Placing them before their most prosperous dimension. <strong>That is why the new State will admit as an indispensable foundation of its structuring the complete and full autonomy of the Municipalities.</strong> Therein lays the magnificent Spanish tradition of cities, towns, and villages as living, fertile organisms. <strong>There is no possibility of economic triumph nor of efficient administration without the autonomy</strong> we have alluded to. The autonomous Municipalities would then be able to structure themselves into large confederations or regions delimited by a margin of economic or administrative requirements, and, certainly, under the sovereignty of the State, which will always be, like we earlier stated, indisputable and absolute. To <strong>revitalize the regional sentiments </strong>of Spain, there is nothing better than submitting the regions to a rebirth that is realized under the protection of current, firm realities.</p>
