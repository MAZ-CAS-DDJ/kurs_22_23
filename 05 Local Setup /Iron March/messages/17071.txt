	I pity the Croats in some way. Throughout centuries they were instrumentalized by western centers of powers such as Vatican, Vienna and today of Brussels and Washington. When we say that their identity is based on anti-Serb sentiment we are not memeing, it's true. Ffs they are literally making up words so they don't use the Serb ones. Croats can never be anyones friend, you can not trust them. Serbia lost 1/3 of it's population to free them from germanic yoke. How they repay us? By genocide.<br /><br />
	Yugoslavia was in a way outside of socialist block. We had rock and roll culture, discos, american movies and culture was allowed in communist Yugoslavia. It was closer ally of USA and NATO than of CCCP.
