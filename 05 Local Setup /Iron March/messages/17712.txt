	That's fantastic to hear. I'll be honest and say I have never been involved in any active political groups per se, but I'm no longer content resting on my laurels with what's been going on recently, so I'd like to try and make a difference somehow. Do you know any groups that have some younger members in them? I'm 17 (18 in a few months).
