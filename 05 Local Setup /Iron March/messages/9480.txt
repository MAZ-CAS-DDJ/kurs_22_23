<p>Dear Favela Kreig,</p>
<p>This is Blackshirt 13 here. I am sorry to bother you but I just wanted to ask you a couple questions. First I noticed that it was you who started the Neofolk music thread. I am also a big neofolk fan, so it is nice to see another fan and a thread dedicated to it. I was just wondering if you are still interested/ a fan of neofolk? I was also wondering if you will start posting in the neofolk thread again? I have been posting there a bit myself, but it does look like anyone else does. Finally, I was wondering if you know of a RELIABLE website were I can buy some Von Thronstahl and or Death in June stuff. Anyways sorry to bother you and I would really appreciate it if you wrote back.</p>
<p>Hail,</p>
