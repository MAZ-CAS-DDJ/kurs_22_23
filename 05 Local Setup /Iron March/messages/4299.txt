<p>I recall you saying at some point that one of the things preventing you from becoming a proper Christian was that you enjoy pre-marital sex too much, I think I may (or may not, who knows) be able to remove that roadblock.  </p>
<p>Obviously, if you think the reasoning is too shaky or whatever, feel free to ignore, but still give it a quick read. It is 3 in the morning so excuse me if I don't cite sources.</p>
<p><strong>1) The source of the laws the Gentiles must keep</strong></p>
<p>As you probably well know, as Gentiles we do not have to keep the law of Moses (as Paul notes in 1 Timothy 1:8-11, the law is to keep the worst of society in check, not for the righteous), this was decided in Acts 15 when we are told what commands we shall keep: "<sup>28</sup> For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things: <sup>29</sup> that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality, from which if you keep yourselves, it will be well with you. Farewell."</p>
<p>These commands are a summary of Leviticus 17-18, leviticus 17 sets out the laws for the killing and eating of animals (no black pudding, sorry), whilst Leviticus 18  sets out the sexual sins. Feel free to read them for yourself, but I'll summarise them here:</p>
<p>No incest - don't even look at family members naked.</p>
<p>No sex with your wife and her sister - don't marry the sister.</p>
<p>No sex with you neighbour's wife</p>
<p>Don't be a queer or fuck animals.</p>
<p>"Fornication" i.e. pre-marital sex is simply not mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>2) The word "Fornication", or "Sexual Immorality".</strong></p>
<p>The main word translated as "fornication" or "Sexual immorality" is "πορνεία" or "porneia" (yes, porn). Porneia comes from the word "περναω" or "pernaō" which means "to sell off". The word for a prostitute is "πόρνη" or "pornē".</p>
<p>It is entirely reasonable then to suggest that "porneia", given its origins is not 'fornication' - 'pre-marital sex', but prostitution - whoredom. It really changes the tone of the book:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(Colossians 3:5)</span></p>
<p>"Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:" (KJV)</p>
<p>"Put to death, then, your members that are upon the earth -- whoredom, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and the covetousness, which is idolatry --" (Young's Literal Translation)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(Ephesians 5:3)</span></p>
<p>"But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;" (KJV)</p>
<p>"and whoredom, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints; "(YLT)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(Revelation 21:8)</span></p>
<p>"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." (KJV)</p>
<p>"and to fearful, and unstedfast, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all the liars, their part is in the lake that is burning with fire and brimstone, which is a second death.'" (YLT)</p>
<p>Hell, the word fornication itself meant sex with prostitutes! (The latin fornicari means to keep company with prostitutes, which itself is derived from fornix which is a euphamism for brothel).</p>
<p>I don't fully approve of "porneia" being only translated as "whoredom", as obviously it is not the only sexual sin (faggotry for example), "sexual immorality" is perfectly accurate, and as stated earlier "sexual immorality" (which I believe most translators use these days) does not necessarily include "fornication" as a bunch of dusty old pagan stoics (I assume) would have us believe.</p>
<p>As with everything that goes against the grain of modern Christianity there is a lot of shit about this from the other side that more or less amounts to "But that's how we've always translated it!", "muh church fathers", "muh tradition".</p>
<p>Hallelujah</p>
<p>Mierce</p>
<p>Note: Adultery too is very forbidden, that is without a doubt, don't do it.</p>
