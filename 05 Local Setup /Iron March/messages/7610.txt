<p>Would love to tell you more about our scene but don't like to talk about it on the internet. For me, it was simple to join it, just walking down to the football stadium would be enough to meet few of the key guys. Used to live near the famous Bežigrad stadium where local club from my city played. <a href="http://stadioni.org/media/images/ljubljana/stadion-za-bezigradom/stadion-za-bezigradom-glavno_04.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://stadioni.org/media/images/ljubljana/stadion-za-bezigradom/stadion-za-bezigradom-glavno_04.jpg</a> As I said, we had strong scene up until 2010, we were the last generation of guys here who were street fascists, recruited into it from early age. Now we don't have much young guys anymore, back in my days you'd walk into city on friday or saturday nights and you'll always see different crews: all kinds skinhead/NS crews, football fans and hooligans, Serb/Bosnian wannabe gangsters, anti-fa punkers too, although I never had much contact with them... There were fights and other incidents all the time, you just don't see that anymore. Different generation, different times. My generation has grown up and we're not into this street shit anymore either. I met like hundreds of fascists, a lot of people came and went through this scene. I practically know everyone with these views from my country. What can I say, you meet a lot of good and degenerate people, and a lot of random people in between. </p>

<p>That's just how it is here in Eastern Europe, scene is large in most of big cities, especially in capital cities, it's not like in America where it mostly exists on the internet or in really marginal circles like those bonehead skinheads or NSM.</p>

<p>To be honest though, I was never that attracted to this scene as such, I was always more attracted to the principles and ideology. I always kept distance from actual movements. Most of guys joined as enthusiastic youngters and then regreted it. I suggest you to take the same attitude as me, don't really join anything, just keep contacts with people and keep your eyes open, check the character of those fascists or whatever they are all the time. A lot of people from this scene make a great first impression but through time they expose themselves as total scumbags. I can tell you from personal experience because I've been in this scene for 10 years, and I was intelligent enough to figure out what people are all about.</p>

<p>My weekend was ok, I was training every day basically. Friday, satudary, sunday, on all three days. Didn't go out, there was a big party on saturday but I gave it a pass, didn't really feel like it. University started, boring as usual. How was your weekend?</p>
