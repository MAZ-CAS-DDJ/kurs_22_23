	Some of my own ideas for start:
</p>

<p>
	Saw the little surprises, being the memes. Prolly don't need memes in these videos or more blown out to be in line with the overall theme, otherwise I think the memes would stand out a bit too much and be a distraction.
</p>

<p>
	At around 33 minute mark Manson talks about how Hitler was possibly greater than Christ and explains why, after that explanation there is a long pause with a deadpan stare from Bob Larson - that could make for a great end of a video where you use a needle scratch or glass crash and music drops or the music is stuck on loop with a needle scratch resetting it back a bit and then it rapidly goes to black with some fading sound effect.
</p>

<p>
	Somewhere between 35 and 39 minutes Mason talks about putting bob in a concentration camp to concentrate - perfect spot for footage of concentration camp footage if there's any around that would be suitable, maybe cut in something from some holohoax documentary talking about the concentration camps and have mason's statement echo, same for his later comment on gassing someone being "traditional" with more documentary voice talking about the gassings.
</p>

<p>
	At 42 minutes or so the girl calls, maybe have that as a standalone segment and fill it with nazi skingirls or something, optional minor idea, empathize somehow when she tells Bob "you're the moron".
