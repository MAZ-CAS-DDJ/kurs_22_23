<p>Holy Rus is certainly something to aspire to for Russians and Ukrainians alike, however you should let go of the idea of a 'Third Rome' and the israelism you advocate in your General Statement of Belief. Messianism is alien to the Slavic racial soul and because of that, the different Slavic messianisms that unfortunately evolved in the last centuries have done nothing but damage to the nations that espoused them. IMHO, they are corruptions that can be attributed to the influence of an already degenerate West. Also, instead of referring to Moscow's political tradition, you should instead cherish the legacy of the magnificient medieval Russian states like Novgorod, Tver or Pskov. These states were much more Aryan in their nature and much more in line with the love for freedom that is inherent to all the Slav peoples. Regarding religion, I view any kind of dogmatism as harmful to faith and spirituality. The teachings are helpful to get a grasp of what is beyond the physical cosmos, but once you are conscious of the existence of God, your soul will find the right way automatically. First and foremost, the way to God is empathy, which is also the core of Aryanism. This explains why I reject WN/WS. These ideological abominations tell you to live only for the good of those most similar to you while turning a blind eye to the suffering of everyone else. By this logic, the nation is not a sacred, spiritual unity, but becomes an extension of the ego (and the ego is in fact Satan). Of course, this is incompatible with Aryan thought and incompatible with the Slavic racial soul. Universal compassion and a strong sense of justice is what made the Slav peoples great back in the days. To let Bright Rus shine again, we need to brush off all the garbage that has been burdening our souls for centuries now.</p>
