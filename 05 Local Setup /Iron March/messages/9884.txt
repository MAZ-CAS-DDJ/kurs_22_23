<p>The immigration situation in Italy is disgusting. An unelected technocratic government literally plucks the boat people out of the water and gives them free shit without any obligations. When they should really be sinking them all off of Lampedusa. This year they have already "rescued" over 60k. Matteo Renzi and all his minions need to be shot and thrown in the Med.</p>

<p>The people are sick of it no matter their politics, there is 40% youth unemployment and this is still allowed to go on. Now the EU is forcing other Euro nations to take on some of Italy's burden, like Slovakia. It really is the frontline of Europe and where the revolution will begin, imo.</p>

<p>They have the best music, best style, best graphics, best everything of any fascist movement. Truly the hope for Italy. Shills sometimes attack them for not being very openly antisemite/racist but they don't really understand the political situation of repression in Italy and their implicit attitudes, not to mention their support for and affiliation with most worthwhile NS movements in Europe.</p>

<p>If you want more of his writings, I have everything that's worthwhile in my personal archive. Also, if you want me to send you modern Italian fascist music that'd be cool.</p>
