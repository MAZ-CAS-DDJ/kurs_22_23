	Serbian Chauvinism behaves like the fake mother: if she can't make the child (the Croats) her own, she would rather kill him than to let someone else have him.

	This hate is unrealistic, as your arguments are going against each other. On one hand, you are talking about demographic crisis (which is something all nations are facing with in Europe, and we can only blame ourselves), on the other hand you want to renew one of the deadliest conflicts in your history and either forcefully assimilate or wipe out those who you see as your blood brothers.

	What about Crna Gora? They are also invented their own "Montenegrin" language, and today most of the population identifies as Montenegrins instead of Serbs. The West doesn't even had to intervene to separate them from Serbia. I don't know about them killing Serbs en masse, but don't they count as traitors also?

	I am really glad that you don't have hard feelings against the surrounding Khanates, but that won't stop you being Chauvinist against Croatians. When you are ready to ally with former enemy nations but only in order to team up against the newers - that is still inside the structure of 'Divide et Impera', and it will still lead to a Chauvinistic war between blocs of nations, and the real enemy will get away again. Don't forget that the Croatian nation is also under attack, just like you.
