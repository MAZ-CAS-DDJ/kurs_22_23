	Ayy lmao. The police dropped the case because they didn't have enough dirt on me to do any further questioning without getting everyone else in town to hate them, considering a lot of people know me from all of the community service ive done. Helping out garden sales, planting flowers, building shit, and even organizing the town faire among a lot of other things. Accusing a well-known selfless kid of being part of a neo-Nazi organization would probably cause a riot or at least extreme civil unrest in my town.
