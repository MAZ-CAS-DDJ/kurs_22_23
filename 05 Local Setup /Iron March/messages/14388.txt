	Oh, cool! I love black metal, it's one of my three musical passions, the others being classical (obviously) and Celtic folk.

	And cool! I agree, the Orthodox Church has done much more to curb liberal degeneration than the Catholic, Anglican, or Protestant churches.

	Personally, I was raised Episcopalean, then later went through an edgy fedora atheist stage in my teens, and once I grew up and discovered Fascism, I ditched atheism and materialism and now I'm a sort of Pagan in the philosophical/esoteric sense. To me, the Pagan gods, from the Celtic to the Norse to the Greek, embody natural and healthy values; they're like ideas to strive towards. I definitely now believe that humans have souls and that there is a metaphysical element to existence. My theory is that it's very possible that the Pagan gods are like personifications of raw spiritual "forces" or "archetypes" in a sort of Buddhist or Jungian sense of the word, and they coexist in symbiosis with Man.
