<p>Well, I consider myself a Dacian Nationalist. I do not believe that we, Romanians, are the descendants of Romans, but of Dacians. Even though it sounds great to be the descendant of a mighty Volk such as Romans, I do not believe such blasphemy.</p>
<p>We, the Dacians, are true warriors. The legendary history affirmed that the God of War was born in <strong>OUR</strong> country. We have brought the Romans their dear Mars.</p>
<p>Those who do not know the truth might laugh at someone who identifies himself as Dacian, but remember..</p>
<p>It was a brave Volk that imposed tribute to the beautiful mistress of marble of the world - Rome. It was a noble Volk who's fall downfall fills you with tears, and not despair. And to be the descendant of a Volk of heroes, full of nobility, of Nationalism and liberty never was and never will be a shame.</p>
