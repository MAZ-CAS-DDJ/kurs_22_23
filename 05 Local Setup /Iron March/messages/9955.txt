<p>Ah, you are right Venator I didn't catch the fact that tying to justify "might makes right" on a moral basis would lead to a paradox, I apologize.  I guess I just meant to justify "might makes right" by pointing out that the "weak" have no right to demand things from the "strong". But then again I guess that this in of itself is another moral opinion and is up to the individual person to decide on its justification. But I am now curious as to what you think Venator, do you thing "might makes right" can be justified on a bases other than moral? Perhaps I am just missing something here. Also, don't forget to answer my previous questions as to weather you checked out the neofolk music I rec-amended. They can easily be found on Youtube or just look at some of my posts in the neofolk thread, as well as one post I made in the general music thread by the band Triarii. I am also curious but, are you american Venator, if so where about are you located? Anyways, as always it is good to hear from you my friend and I hope to hear from you again real soon.</p>
