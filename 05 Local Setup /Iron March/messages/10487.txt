<p>So my intro topic got locked for some reason, but on the subject at hand...</p>
<p>Haci Bektash Veli was of both Turkish and Iranian descent, the latter making him much more inclined toward the path of Ahlul Bayt. There are many times in his teachings where he gives lessons from the teachings of both Imam Ali (as) and Imam Jafar as-Sadiq (as). Our entire order is filled with symbolism of the Ahlul Bayt and madhab of Imam as-Sadiq (as). The order itself took on a much more Sunni style practice to escape persecution from the Ottomans. There came a time when the Ottomans were killing all followers of the Ahlul Bayt, so the order went into taqiyya in order to survive, even the Naqshbandis that were present in the area at the time started saying that their pir was Abu Bakr in order to escape death.</p>
<p>As for the Alawites, you will find that they recognize him as a saint, but not their fountain of knowledge. Alevis more so acknowledge him as their pir.</p>
<p>If you want any more information on the order, just ask, I can answer questions or at least direct you to more information in the way of sites and pdf books!</p>

<p>I don't know about his persian heritage, though I should perhaps tell you that prior to Shah Ismail taking control in Iran, it was mostly a sunni country, and most Persians were generally Sunni, only after the Safawids came to power the country became a bastion of Shia Islam.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And you could be right, I'm no expert on Haci Bektash Veli, he could have been influenced heavily by Shia literature, but we hold it that his tariqah is a descendant of the Yassawi tariqah. </p>
<p>On a side note, Mawlana, who was also another prominent sufi of the times, wrote and spoke exclusively in Persian, given his Persian heritage, yet held no beliefs that were similar to the Jafariyyah, though I can say it with certainty that they had similar rituals with the Alevi in Anatolia: the Alevis participate in a ritualized dance called "Semah", while the Mawlawis also have one called "Sema". Both were keen on religious music, using instruments, whereas the Alevis used the instruments of the Turkmen tribals, such as the baglama, the Mawlawis used instruments that were taken from the Arabs and Persians, like the Ney, lute, and Qanun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In any case, the Bektashi order became a state institution, whereas other Shia or Shia influenced sects became outlawed. I guess this is not just due to their more Sunni appareance, but due to their status as the official sect of the Janissary core, who were(at least nominally) fiercely loyal to the Ottoman Throne, so there was no need to eliminate the Bektashi.</p>
<p>But I'd say that I have certain problems with your terminology, for I myself belive that I hold a lot of love for Ahlul Bayt myself, and some of my ancestors were Spahis for the Porte, and some were members of prominent Akinji families that went to colonize the Balkans, it was not that we were killing "followers of Ahlul Bayt", more than so we were killing traitors to the throne. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ones we killed were mostly of the same race as we are, some even of the same tribe as I am, the Afsharids, who later became hot-shot rulers in Iran. It was Shah Ismail who duped the Turkmen into believing that they would be kings in Persia.</p>
<p>As for the Naqshibandis, they are known to be very secretive, and the ones I talked to never told me about their supposed adherence to whatever Shia doctrine that they might hide through their taqiyyah, but if you say that they do, I guess there could be a shred of truth to it, since no one knows what goes on in their inner circles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have a question: what is your take on the Sahaba? Good, or evil? Mumin, or kuffar?</p>
