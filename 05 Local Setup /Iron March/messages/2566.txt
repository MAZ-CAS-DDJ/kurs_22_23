<p>Guilliame Faye is another writer worth looking up. I agree about the march forum, the general thing is to be a fascist as an identity rather than work towards it. The jew and the commie are convenient labels, the enemy is either one or the other. When i wrote i was a 'Post-industrial maoist'(a contradiction in terms, an irony) they labelled and attacked me as a commie!!!</p>
