<p>You dont ask me. I like all of the major ones, I usually let a youtube playlist play whilst I read and listen to whatever comes up. That's Triarii, Legionari, Arditi as the main ones. I enjoy whatever smaller ones end up in my playlist, but they tend to have to fewer songs, BloodSoil, Across the Rubicon, Cvltro, Imperat, etc. As for Neofolk I do the same really, but I listen to industrial more. Darkwood and von thronstahl, etc.Â </p>
