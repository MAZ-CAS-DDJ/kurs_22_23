	Hey do you know how to get an entry level job at Microsoft? All their web sites are rubbish. I'm doing a one-year programming course and I have the funniest love-hate relationship with Microsoft. I wouldn't mind being a bug hunter or QA person for them. Though I'm sure there are many other companies! The downside is that my education is short. I just want practical experience and maybe I'll move to the US if it looks okay. I won't be allowed to join any militias on a Green Card though. Best to downplay my political opinions LMAO!
