<p>I think an American-born Mexican would have issues proving their Mexican-ness in a nationalist movement. And the CIA was literally behind every bush and branch in Latin America back then, doesn't surprise me. I see the value of synarchism for Mexicans, but for someone like me, I really don't. It'd be a waste of my time.</p>
