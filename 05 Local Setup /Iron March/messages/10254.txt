<p>Messaging here cause skype has refused to send my messages for the past few hours.<br /><br />Firstly, when moving posts, clicking on the thing that brings up the "Enter topic ID" is the correct way to move a post in one thread into a different thread, right? Seems obvious but haven't tried this yet and don't want to fuck shit up again.<br /><br />Second, What's the protocol for when somebody posts something retarded then asks you to delete it for them?<br /><br /><a href="<___base_url___>/index.php?/topic/5299-hitler-was-a-weeaboo/?p=120148" rel="">http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/topic/5299-hitler-was-a-weeaboo/?p=120148</a><br /><br />Do I delete it, or leave it as a testament to their retardedness? This is trivial shit ofc but I want to know in general, if we delete people's posts when they ask us to.</p>
