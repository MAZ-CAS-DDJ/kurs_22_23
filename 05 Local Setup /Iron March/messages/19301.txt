	Ah I see. Well, when I saw he called it "globalist bullshit" and all that, I thought it was a much worse situation, like he was just totally against it, or maybe he thought it was some sort of communism. That's the impression I got. But I guess it's not that bad then. It's probably just an innate Orthodox thing inside him. He doesn't have that Catholic or Sunni drive for world conquest like we do (or… actually, he's half-Uzbek, so who knows). Well, either way, I'm still going to fanatically champion the cause of one fascist world government. All we need is a hierarchical system of decentralized centralization, and the problem solves itself. Long live the one holy fascist monarchy. Fascist pride, worldwide. 88.
