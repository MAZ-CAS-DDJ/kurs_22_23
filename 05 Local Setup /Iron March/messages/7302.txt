<p>I am obviously very pleased to hear that you are well - really interesting escape, would be really interested to hear more some day - They are unlikely to know about Im, but we could play safe for a bit. I bet extraditing from Venezuela is an absolute nightmare. </p>

<p>What are your thougts on Griffin stepping down - I don't really know enough to see what this means. They are putting up a unification front - I wonder if it is sincere or they are just trying to get time and will break off.</p>

<p>YBNP are a laughing stock for all the reasons we have explained (<a data-ipb="nomediaparse" href="http://birmingham.tab.co.uk/2014/05/13/they-fear-militant-homosexuals-and-heartless-zionists-meet-the-bnp-youth-theyre-absolutely-terrifying/" rel="external nofollow">Here is the reminder. Guess which one of these is Nick griffin's daughter</a>).

<p>like you implied, 'triangulation' or whatever was always the idea. to basically tug the spectrum to the right, and make shill parties sound more reasonable - ideally you get a rush to the far right. </p>

<p>We have some things planned over the next few weeks. Alex our organiser was kicked out of university, though he wasn't going to stay anyway - that generated a small splash. Unis are still getting hit and that is pissing off some people, but nothing big since that mirror article - but I will be milking that forever. Honestly, now we have come to this point, it is like we are at capacity and ideally need to have a place where we can all live.</p>
