	Hi,
</p>

<p>
	I am looking at doing a bulk printing for your 3-poster set of Stop the Fags. I am wondering if you can do versions that will use less ink, as that is a significant cost. Also, can you easily alter them for black and white printing? That would be great! The most important thing, however, is just to make them use less ink. Thanks.
