	No he openly praised the Columbine shooters , I don't agree with that one of them was a kike and they killed plenty of innocent whites , also he tried to get bomb materials , that plus his demeanor just suggests that he isn't right in the head. It's one thing to be comfortable with death and killing but its another thing to gleefully play with it like it's some kind of toy.

	I don't like Mcveigh all of his views were christian Identity libertarianism and the faggots here hail him as some kind of hero , his bomb killed a bunch of kids at a daycare center , they could have grown up to be racially aware there was no way to know just because their parents were in the government doesn't mean they would have been pro government.

	Breivik targeted an ideological summer camp for communist teenagers you can't compare the two, he's not a baby killer he is an actual hero.

	I hate the modern world and I don't think terrorism is the answer simply rejecting it and refusing to participate in it is , only use violence to defend yourself.
