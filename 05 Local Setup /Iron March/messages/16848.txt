			Hedonism meant that you want to achieve pleasure, but the meaning behind this word was different, it was something like experiencing beauty

	You mean something like, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNaXQQbcgw0&amp;t=2m" rel="external nofollow">this clip of Salieri listening to Mozart</a>?
</p>

<p>
	Huh, I never knew this. I actually used to think hedonism was just the ancient world's version of modern decadence, and I didn't know it had a deeper history behind it. I'll have to research this more, because it's something I've experienced myself: listening to the likes of Wagner and Bach, going to temples and churches, reading great literature, etc. Is this what hedonism was supposed to refer to?
</p>

<p>
	And also, that's an interesting point about language in general, and how Involution can just take place via shifts within the language, as a given word or phrase becomes more dumbed down as time goes on, and it no longer gives the same meaning to people. The philosopher Wittgenstein was a Jew, but he expressed lots of interesting mystical ideas in his books that are similar to what we're talking about here. I remember reading somewhere about how he felt that people in the future would understand him even less than those in his time, and that he was writing for people who are "thinking in a different way, breathing a different air of life." Laozi also talks about a similar sense of linguistic mysticism in his Tao Te Ching.
</p>

<p>
	Considering that nationalism is always so connected to language, and that most nations are demarcated via their language, I think this is actually a really important issue for a fascist to understand and protect. Interestingly enough, in a sense the Quran tries to guard itself against this form of Involution because it constantly repeats that it's the one word of God, and that it can only be understood in its own version of Arabic, and that translations are never correct or even allowed in many cases. (Perhaps that's why even today, an Arab can read the Quran and understand it, whereas an Englishman cannot read or understand something like Beowulf.) But even then, as you can see, this Islamic attempt at stopping involution was still not enough, and today even clerics and imams sometimes struggle with reconciling that "I have my religion, you have your religion" part with their own desire for Islamic dominance. Combine this with the hidden germs that we talked about, and also with the general need for humanism developed by much of the Middle East's capitalist economy, and it's easy to see how 50% of this region's way of life has almost become worse than that of Protestants, and somehow in an even shorter span of time.

	Wew lad. That's a nightmare right there.

	If it's any consolation, South (Iraqi) Kurdistan has disastrously taken in about 2 million Arab sand coons as refugees, so we have it even worse than you do. Our politicians are even more short-sighted than yours. The Arabs are even becoming a regular part of South Kurdistan's economy, and God knows how much the future race/ethnic/nationalistic wars will harm the Kurdish population due to the parasitic politicians of today, who are doing all of this because they want to suck America's dick and sell Kurdistan to the US. God, sometimes I even wish South Kurdistan would just be wiped off of the map, so maybe making that future race war worse will somehow be a good thing after all.
</p>

<p>
	Surprisingly enough, the communist parts of Kurdistan don't have any refugees going into them, and in fact the Arabs are fleeing from West (Syrian) Kurdistan. It's the same thing you Europeans dealt with: capitalist Europe sucked America's dick and quickly became a multicultural cesspool, whereas communist Europe had such an inefficient economy that no one wanted to go there anyway. Of course, a fascist state is the only true and full answer, since it takes care of all of the above political and economic problems, and then it adds the spiritual dimension as well, which takes the nation to absolute perfection. But when we don't have fascism, I've noticed that every example I've seen so far indicates that communism is still less harmful than capitalism. Do you happen to agree with that too?

			The ultimate man is neither male nor female, but their synthesis what can be achieved by the male (also their synthesis is not the unity of a half-male and a half-female, like in some cases in our era; but the unity of a full male and a full female, represented by traditional families in reality, and by the mythological Androgynos in the ideal world).

	I understand your point about Chaos and Order too. It's basically the classic Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva triad, right?
</p>

<p>
	By the way, what are your thoughts on the current state of Hinduism? Yazdanism (and Yazidism) are closely connected with Hinduism, so I'm wondering if spending some time in India and learning more about their Tradition would help us get closer to ours as well. (It would be like a half-way compromise between Guenon and Evola's perspectives, where the former said you can insert yourself into a foreign Tradition, while the latter said you can't do that. But this wouldn't be either of those, like I said, since it would be both foreign and familiar to us at the same time.)

			I was referring to the Kurds as a whole. I thought you were "Arabized"
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Oh, I see. Well, when it comes to language, we're not Arabized at all. Interestingly enough, Kurdish is the purest Iranian language, and even Persian is much more Arabic in both vocabulary and spirit compared to Kurdish.
</p>

<p>
	But when it comes to blood, sadly it's true that there's a large Semitic component within the Kurdish nation (and within other Iranian populations). It's actually a problem that us Kurdish nationalists are yet to find an exact solution for, because the source of the problem is not clear in the first place. We want to use eugenics to improve the Kurdish population, but our task is not as clearcut as Germany's task was in the previous century (and it's also not as clearcut as Europe's or America's task will be in the future).
</p>

<p>
	The largest part of this uncertainty comes from that Nordic issue I mentioned in the previous message. If Mein Kampf is right that the Nordic-looking segments within the Iranian ethnicities are leftover descendants of the ancient Aryans, then that would essentially mean that the ancient Aryans were Nordic, and that Kurds and Persians and all other Iranians are "fallen Aryans" today. But if Mein Kampf is incorrect, then that would mean that the essence of the Iranian race lies elsewhere, and it would also mean that the ancient Aryans were not Nordic (since, as you mentioned, the word "Iranian" comes from "Aryan"). So, depending on which one is the right answer, we would have to take a completely different approach to racial eugenics if we want to stay inline with Truth.
</p>

<p>
	I believe in Rockwell's statement that we should apply science to ourselves without egotism. But the problem is, if we don't even know in which direction we should apply that science, then our hands are bound by a much bigger problem. I'll have to do much more research on this issue, because it is truly central to any attempt at establishing Truth in Kurdistan.
